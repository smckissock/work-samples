  "It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and other entities he gave the data to, including Cambridge Analytica, formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data — which they ultimately did.",

  "But while our primary focus was on traditional threats, we also saw some new behavior in the summer of 2016 when APT28-related accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists.",

  "I've directed our teams to invest so much in security — on top of the other investments we're making — that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward.",

  "And when we address these challenges, I know we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.",
  "We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world, and every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most.",
  "We also required developers to get approval from Facebook before they could request any data beyond a user's public profile, friend list, and email address.",
  "In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the Facebook information apps could access.",

  "Last month, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified.",
  "What Happened\n\nElections have always been especially sensitive times for our security team, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election was no exception.",
  "This will make it much harder for people to run pages using fake accounts, or to grow virally and spread misinformation or divisive content that way.",

  "I realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for Facebook and our community — they're challenges for all of us as Americans.",

  "Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to investigate this.",
  "It's not enough to give people control of their information, we have to make sure developers they've given it to are protecting it too.",

  "Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.",
  "But there's more we can do here to limit the information developers can access and put more safeguards in place to prevent abuse.",

  "RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nFacebook's mission is about giving people a voice and bringing people closer together.",

  "Leading up to Election Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia.",
  "What Happened\n\nIn 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social.",
  "That includes improving the way we protect people's information and safeguard elections around the world.",
  "And we'll also keep building tools to help more people make their voices heard in the democratic process.",
  "These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access as much Facebook data today.",
  "But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.",
  "We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we're working hard to get better.",
  "And we also told everyone whose Facebook information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "We have disabled thousands of accounts tied to organized, financially motivated fake news spammers.",
  "From now on, every advertiser who wants to run political or issue ads will need to be authorized.",
  "Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here.",

  "We're starting this in the U.S. and expanding to the rest of the world in the coming months.",
