AINV -1.38% , part of private-equity giant Apollo, and Highbridge, the investment management arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nLike a number of other independent oil-company executives who have been forced to put their companies into bankruptcy in recent month, Miller Chief Executive Carl Giesler blamed his company’s financial woes in part on plummeting oil prices.",
  "It charged Miller Energy, its former chief financial officer and its chief operating officer for allegedly inflating values of oil and gas properties, which boosted the company from the ranks of penny stocks into one that eventually listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where its stock reached a 2013 high of nearly $9 a share.",

  "Company officials had recently been in talks with a prospective lender for $165 million capital infusion, Mr. Giesler said in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal, but the SEC charge and the involuntary bankruptcy filing torpedoed the deal.",

  "Under the deal, which requires court approval, Apollo and Highbridge will swap some $190 million in Miller’s second-lien debt for new debt and 100% of the equity in the reorganized company.",
  "As for the SEC accounting-fraud accusations, Mr. Giesler said Miller Energy has reached a tentative settlement with the regulator to pay $5 million over the next three years.",

  "The two firms are also providing Miller with up to $20 million in bankruptcy financing so the company can stay up and running during its restructuring.",
  "The proposed restructuring provides Miller’s unsecured creditors with a minimum cash recovery and warrants to purchase equity in the new company.",
  "Miller Energy, a former Tennessee company that shifted its oil and gas drilling to Alaska in recent years, has also been beset by other problems.",
  "If approved by the SEC, the settlement would apply only to the company but not to the individual employees, who are no longer with the company.",

  "The price of global benchmark Brent crude fell to less than $45 a barrel this summer from more than $100 a barrel a year ago.",
  "Miller Energy didn’t admit to wrongdoing as part of the deal, according to securities filings.",
