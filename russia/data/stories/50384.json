Bannon about China, and said, “The next commander-in-chief, whomever it may be, is going to confront a China that is not peacefully rising, but is aggressively inserting itself [in the world] … at our expense.”\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee has proposed a significant change in trade policies available from his website: REFORMING THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.",
  "Meanwhile, some contend that Hillary Clinton’s biggest challenge in the 2016 race may be China, given her husband’s role in creating the very policies that have helped to diminish America’s standing in the world:\n\nIn truth, Hillary’s ultimate problem in the 2016 presidential race may not be Benghazi, Emailgate, Filegate, Monica, Pardongate, Vince Foster, Whitewater, or a broad-based perception that she is a cold, calculating, and untrustworthy woman.",
  "Gaffney also discussed China’s military build up, calling it “comprehensive, aggressive, and systematic,” along with concerns over their economic warfare against the U.S. and ongoing “intelligence operations at a fever pitch.”\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern weekdays on SiriusXM Patriot 125.",
