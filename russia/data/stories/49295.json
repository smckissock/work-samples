  "Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company’s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill.\n\nLast Friday, after The New York Times, The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained, the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back, saying Facebook must first conduct a “full forensic audit of the firm” and “have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here.”\n\nThe reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe.",
  "“But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.”\n\nFacebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban.",
  "Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr. Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data, and state attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York have begun investigating Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.",
  "The information, photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network, and to the company’s profitability.",

  "Mr. Zuckerberg’s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking.",
  "“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.",
  "The resulting backlash is Facebook’s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr. Zuckerberg and others in 2004.",
  "A #DeleteFacebook movement calling on people to close their accounts has also gathered steam.",
  "In Washington, there have been more calls for regulation of internet companies like Facebook."
