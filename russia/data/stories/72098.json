  "But it's also correct that if she's making that claim, she lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is a crime, which goes directly to her credibility and she probably has limited --\n\n\n\nBERMAN: I mean, if it's true that she was an informant, it's also true that she was trying to give dirt, you know, about a candidate to another candidate in the United States.",
  "You have to remember Vladimir Putin, you know, is a former intelligence officer himself so he's going to take an interest in, you know, what at the time must have been, you know, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, influence operation that he had going on at the time looking, you know, straight into the White House and to the candidates involved.",
  "And so rather than spiking on the 20-yard line, I think the President should learn from that past experience and understand that it's hard to get from A to B here and then to C. And what is said at that negotiating table and what follows in terms of the actual fleshing out of any framework is going to be very, very important.",
  "I talked to a number of Republican senators weeks ago who were very concerned about the qualifications that Dr. Ronny Jackson brought to the job, and we're very frustrated with the fact that there's almost no consultation if any at all before the nomination by tweet that we saw that brought him to the table.",
  "The fact is, though, no one except the participants knows what was actually said or where things went from there, if they went anywhere at all and what, if anything, candidate Trump was told about it in the building, in his office, on that day, in his office just a floor away from where the meeting happened.",
  "Committee Chair Devin Nunes who, as you know, has been accused of carrying water for the administration and was exposed doing it in at least one occasion when he rushed to the White House to allegedly brief officials on what he said was damaging information he'd received about surveillance of Donald Trump.",
  "SHARON LAFRANIERE, CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, I think\n\n\n\nwhat happened was that she was a little bit taken by surprise because we and NBC News obtained a series of e-mail exchanges between her and the Russian prosecutor general and an NBC news correspondent chased her down in Moscow.",
  "Whether it is what she said today or the dossier, put together by Christopher Steele, the former British spy, your -- or always what will -- do we know this, was it -- is it really just Kremlin disinformation and that seems to be a familiar line of attack now from President Trump supporters.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: On a more serious note, the president specifically objected the Democratic Senate Veterans Affairs Committee member, Jon Tester, coming forward with many of the allegations against Dr. Jackson, including that some people call Dr. Jackson \"the candy man\".",
  "So whether one of them calls themselves an informant or has whatever ties they have, they are all going to go home and pay the piper, they're going to talk to the services or to, you know, Vladimir Putin whoever he says and they're going to get fully debriefed on what's going on.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: We get a kick every once in a while, either the fact that I'll be watching people that fail so badly over the last 25 years explaining to me how to make a deal with North Korea, I get a big, big kick out of that.",

  "We asked to subpoena the phone records so we could match up, did Donald Trump receive a call at the same time Donald Jr. was making that call to find out, did the president's son seek the president's permission, the go ahead to go forward with this meeting.",
  "What would be interesting to know was whether Veselnitskaya had any additional tasking, whether she was told, hey, if you do get this response from Donald Trump, Jr. or anybody else in the room, we'd like you to do this, or we'd like you to do that.",
  "MATTHEW ROSENBERG, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: I mean, I think it -- the reason (ph) of the question, why are investigations being pushed to end when this seems like the kind of thing you would want to dig into and find out, is she lying?",
  "That when presented with information that's potentially damaging to the president, it's -- well, maybe, this is the Kremlin trying to get it out here to sow dissension in the U.S. That could be the case but we need a little more evidence on that.",
  "So, to suggest blindly, well we can just retrain this coal miners to install solar panels is a kind of elitist, ignorant and a frankly offensive talk that's not going to making any friends and not going to help you win elections that's for sure.",
  "But, you know, again, I have to get back and emphasize the point that everybody in that, every single Russian in that room, when they return to Moscow, was probably debriefed by the FSB or the SVR, one of the two Russian intelligence services.",

  "CONNOLLY: I think -- well for one thing, I just closed the letter today with my republican friend Walter Jones with 150 signatures on it, it's going to Speaker Ryan asking for a detailed explanation and justification for this action.",
  "And she and the prosecutor general's office were working hand in hand to secretly -- secretly hand in hand to respond to a Justice Department request for evidence in a civil fraud case that was brought in a federal court in New York.",
  "And, what the situation was that our Justice Department had asked the prosecutor general to give us evidence against a Russian businessman who was accused of money laundering and Veselnitskaya was this businessman's defense attorney.",
  "And so you want people around you and you want to rely on them who understand those complexities, so that you're not in service of making a deal agree to things that ultimately are not enforceable, bad for our national security.",
  "Their list runs through more than 30 names which they say is symptomatic of a committee that simply was not interested in getting the full picture, including a phone call that Don Jr. made prior to the Trump Tower meeting.",
  "And back in February, Republicans on the committee released a memo accusing FBI and Justice Department officials of abusing their powers to spy on a former Trump campaign advisor suspected of being an agent for Russia.",
  "I mean, this has become a very familiar kind of line of attack for President Trump supporters, whenever information is presented that is unfavorable to the president, whether it is Natalia --\n\n\n\nLANZA: Veselnitskaya.",
  "And number two, is Kim Jong-un, I mean he's not his father, he's going to be able to come into these negotiations much more capable with his nuclear and ballistic program which makes him more credible at that table.",
  "And I -- you know, breaking news in the Stormy Daniels case, not the federal Michael Cohen criminal hearing in New York over access of documents seized from him know the lawsuit against Michael Cohen in California.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: The intelligence committee report from which Democrats on the panel descended says the committee found no evidence that the Trump campaign helped with Russian meddling in the election.",
  "And in that e-mail, he said that this information that would -- was part of the Russian government's attempt to help Donald Trump's campaign, this information would be delivered by a Russian government attorney.",
  "And so, as each allegation came out, you would talk to senators and one told me flatly, so basically, if any one of these is true, this nomination is done and, John, as we all know now, it didn't even take that.",
  "And he would be foolish not to take advantage of the moment that he finds himself and both from his own capability and from having a South Korean president across the border who is willing to talk and to engage.",
  "He has spent a good part of this morning on the floor one-on-one talking to those of us who are involved in this issue, to apologize and to rec -- and to acknowledge that he recognized the impact of his words.",
  "In fact, when the pushback actually started from the White House, we just saw rather fiercely a little bit after these allegations came out, they put out a two-page fact sheet that they sent to Capitol Hill.",
  "So in this particular case, apparently he used the prosecutor general, Mr. Chaika, and said, hey, do you guys have anybody who you can send in to see whether there's an avenue here into the Trump campaign.",
  "As for the Trump Tower meeting, which Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, campaign chair Paul Manafort attended, and Trump Jr. was promised would include damaging Russian intelligence on Hillary Clinton.",
  "But you can't put a lot of weight on somebody who lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee and is just creating all -- and just sewing all of this descent when people have already come to a decision.",
  "When these allegations started to surface, he called White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, he told him of what he was hearing, raised the concerns and said, kind of what do you want us to do next.",
  "[20:25:00] PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, look, if you really want to look back, John, the reality is this nomination was on thin ice before the allegations even came out.",
  "And, he was the one you might remember who was mentioned in an e-mail that Rob Goldstone, the intermediary sent to Donald Trump, Jr. in 2006 when he was trying to set up the Trump Tower meeting.",
  "May all members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success while others continue to struggle.",
  "Apparently and his caucus this morning he indicated vaguely that there were some members in his caucus they were felt that they had not been properly responded to in terms of ministerial needs.",
  "The intelligence committee merely called their eager attendance and apparent willingness to collect Russian information from their America's cheap nuclear adversary and active \"poor judgment\".",
  "In fact, it's almost laughable except it's not that invoking fairness and remembering those less fortunate, apparently is not, you know, firing offense here in the House of Representatives.",
  "BERMAN: What your Republican colleagues Mark Walker who is part of the group searching for the next chaplain suggested that the replacement base they find it and this is according to him.",
  "My concern about the President is just his -- I bet he's not be over eager to say that he has won a great victory that no other president has won, because there is a long way to go here.",
  "So Sharon, so how was Veselnitskaya gone from telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that she operates \"independently of any governmental bodies\" to admitting she is a Russian informant?",
  "And what happened was that behind the Justice Department's back, the prosecutor general went to Veselnitskaya and together through a series of like 11 e-mails, they crafted a response.",
  "Maybe it's to sow confusion, maybe it's to get the media worked up, maybe it's to get, you know, the Democrats all worked up to say, hey, maybe this investigation isn't (ph) concluded.",

  "BERMAN: David, just a few months ago, President Trump was trading these huge insults with Kim Jong-un on Twitter, bragging about who has a bigger nuclear button on his desk.",
  "I admired that, I accepted his apology and I hope that now a better informed is a member of the search committee for a new chaplain, he'll bring new sensitivity to that job.",
