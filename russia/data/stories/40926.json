  "Now, for the first time, Buzzfeed News is publishing that pitch, a presentation that lays out how Prince wanted to take over the war from the US military — and how he envisioned mining some of the most war-torn provinces in Afghanistan to help fund security operations and obtain strategic mineral resources for the US.",
  "Prince, who founded the Blackwater security firm and testified last week to the House Intelligence Committee for its Russia investigation, has deep connections into the current White House: He’s friends with former presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, and he’s the brother of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.",
  "One surprising element is the commercial promise Prince envisions: that the US will get access to Afghanistan’s rich deposits of minerals such as lithium, used in batteries; uranium; magnesite; and \"rare earth elements,\" critical metals used in high technology from defense to electronics.",
  "\"An East India Company approach,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \"would use cheaper private solutions to fill the gaps that plague the Afghan security forces, including reliable logistics and aviation support.\"",
  "Controversial private security tycoon Erik Prince has famously pitched an audacious plan to the Trump administration: Hire him to privatize the war in Afghanistan using squads of \"security contractors.\"",
  "He patterned the strategy he's pitching on the historical model of the old British East India Company, which had its own army and colonized much of Britain's empire in India.",
  "Here is the never-before-published slide presentation for his pitch, which a source familiar with the matter said was prepared for the Trump administration.",
  "Prince briefed top Trump administration officials directly, talked up his plan publicly on the DC circuit, and published op-eds about it.",
  "One slide estimates the value of mineral deposits in Helmand province alone at $1 trillion.",
  "But the details have never been made public."
