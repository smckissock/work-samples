  "“Better to sell the company now and put the company assets in the hands of somebody who can do something with them.”\n\nAnalysts had hoped for an update on Yahoo's ongoing process to possibly sell all or part of the company, which was announced last month.",
  "Earlier in the day Starboard Value CEO Jeffrey Smith told CNBC Tuesday that the hedge fund and Yahoo shareholder — it's nominated nine candidates for Yahoo's board — continued to talk with the company's management but was not close to a settlement.",
  "\"If we get to the end and they haven't been successful (in) getting the core business sold, we are going to need to pick up the pieces and … we need to be able to make change and that is why you have to go for so many seats,\" he said.",
  "Yahoo's management and board has made \"the strategic alternative process a top priority,\" she said during a conference call with investment analysts, \"to achieve the best possible outcome for our shareholders.\"",
  "However, CEO Marissa Mayer said \"in order to protect the integrity of the process\" that she and management would not comment further on timing of the process or various offers received.",
  "\"There have been cases with this management team and this board where they said that they were going to do things over the last several years and then they didn’t follow through.\"",
  "After the company released its financials on Tuesday, several bidders for the beleaguered company were identified by the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, citing unnamed sources.",
  "“We’re now entering more than a year and a half of deteriorating results from Yahoo and no one seems surprised any more,” said InvestorPlace.com analyst James Brumley.",

  "Making separate bids were Verizon, Britain's Daily Mail and private investment firm TPG, with a group of investors submitting another bid, the Journal reported.",
  "Yahoo’s management needs to make the sale \"a key priority,\" said Sotirios Paroutis, a Warwick Business School professor of strategic management.",
  "\"What parts of the business will be sold to whom and at what price,\" Paroutis said, \"will define the legacy of CEO Marissa Mayer as a leader.\"",
  "Also making bids, according to Reuters, were private equity firms Apax Partners LLP, Apollo Global Management LLC and Warburg Pincus LLC.",
  "Revenue minus the cost of traffic acquisition was $859 million, beating estimates of $846.1 million and within Yahoo's own forecasts.",
