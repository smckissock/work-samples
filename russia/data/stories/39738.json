  "Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie speaks during a press conference at the Frontline Club on March 26, 2018 in London | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Cambridge Analytica helped ‘cheat’ Brexit vote and US election, claims whistleblower Giving evidence to MPs, Chris Wylie claimed the company’s actions during the Brexit campaign were ‘a breach of the law.’\n\nLONDON — Misuse of data and \"cheating\" by Cambridge Analytica and other companies associated with the firm may have altered the outcome of both the U.S. presidential election and the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, a company whistleblower told British lawmakers.",
  "Chris Wylie, the former director of research at Cambridge Analytica, which has been accused of illegally collecting online data of up to 50 million Facebook users, said that his work allowed Donald Trump's presidential campaign to garner unprecedented insight into voters' habits ahead of the 2016 vote.",
  "British politicians also demanded that Zuckerberg give evidence in the country's ongoing investigation into the matter, but Facebook's chief wrote to Damian Collins, the chair of the U.K. parliament's digital, culture, media and sports committee, to say that he would not give evidence.",
  "The unit was set up by Robert Mercer, a U.S. billionaire; Steve Bannon, a former campaign manager for Trump's 2016 campaign; and Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica's chief executive, who was suspended following the most recent allegations.",
  "Wylie's comments to a parliamentary committee come as global anger continues to rise on how people's Facebook and other online data may have been misused as part of political campaigns from the United States to Kenya.",
  "Instead, either Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, or Mike Schroepfer, the company's chief technology officer, is expected to testify to British lawmakers sometime next week, according to U.K. officials.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan, a American-Russian professor at the university, created a smartphone app that provided Cambridge Analytica with reams of digital information on roughly 50 million Facebook users.",
  "\"The projects I was working on may have had a larger impact than I first expected,\" said Wylie, who worked for SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, for about one and a half years.",
  "Questions have been raised as to whether payments to the Canadian company may have broken British campaign financing rules, though both the company and Vote Leave deny these allegations.",
  "He added that a Canadian business with ties to Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL Group, also provided analysis for the Vote Leave campaign ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
  "Over four hours of testimony, Wylie gave insight into how Cambridge Analytica was able to build complex data analysis tools to target potential voters during multiple U.S. campaigns.",
  "He added that he would have voted to leave the EU if he could have voted, and his evidence was about protecting the U.K.'s democratic system, and not about overturning the 2016 vote.",
  "That included ties to Aggregate IQ, or AIQ, a Canadian company which helped to develop the underlying algorithm that was used by Cambridge Analytica to target Facebook users.",
  "\"It's categorically untrue that Cambridge Analytica has never used Facebook data\" — Chris Wylie\n\nWylie said he was \"incredibly remorseful\" for helping to set up the company.",
  "It added that Wylie had been a \"part-time contractor\" who left the organization in 2014, who did not have any knowledge of the company's workings beyond that date.",
  "When asked by a British lawmaker if the data-mining company had any ties to Cambridge University, Wylie added: \"There was nothing formalized with the university.",
  "Still, Wylie said, the use of such data analytics by campaigns linked to leaving the EU had a material effect in convincing many people how to vote.",
  "Cambridge Analytica refuted Wylie's accusations, saying that it did not inappropriately collect or share data on Facebook users with third-parties.",
  "\"Whenever Steve Bannon would come into town, we would set up this fake office to present a more academic side of the company,\" Wylie told the MPs.",
  "To give it an air of academic credibility, according to Wylie, the founders wanted to play up potential research ties with Cambridge University.",
  "Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, took responsibility for potential shortcomings in a message posted on the social network last week.",
  "Three U.S. congressional committees have already called on the 33-year-old to testify on his company's involvement in the ongoing data scandal.",
  "\"A further independent audit alongside regulatory investigations will confirm this once and for all,\" the company said in a message on Twitter.",
  "This research, Wylie said, likely breached the U.K.'s strict campaign financing laws and may have helped to sway the final Brexit outcome.",
  "The former employee also outlined how AIQ was used by the Vote Leave campaign to target British voters ahead of the Brexit referendum.",
  "\"I think it's incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\" he told British lawmakers.",
  "\"Steven Bannon said we should call it Cambridge Analytica because of its close association with the university.\"",
  "These data transfers, according to Facebook, broke the social network's terms and conditions.",
  "\"We would still like to hear evidence from Mark Zuckerberg as well,\" Collins said Tuesday.",
  "How do you create a massive operation in a country where AIQ had not worked before?\"",
  "\"It's categorically untrue that Cambridge Analytica has never used Facebook data.\"",
  "This is an irreversible change to the constitutional settlement of this country.\"",
  "\"Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica, it's not a legitimate business.\"",
  "Wylie also gave insight into how Cambridge Analytica was created in late 2013.",
  "\"If we allow cheating in our democratic process ... What about next time?",
  "This is cheating,\" he told British politicians Tuesday.",
  "\"This is not some council race, or a by-election.",
  "\"There’s not much more we can say on the matter.\"",
  "\"My question is where did they get the data?",
  "The social network denies any wrongdoing.",
  "Both companies deny such a connection.",
  "It was done professor to professors.",
  "What about the time after that?",
  "This is a breach of the law.",
  "It sat in a grey area.\""
