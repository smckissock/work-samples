  "In a new paper published Tuesday morning, leading cyber security firm FireEye says its iSight intelligence arm has tracked a national-security related spying arm it calls APT37 that has \"expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication.\"",
  "The group also has hacked a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with North Korean human rights issues and a Japanese organization associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights, FireEye said.",

  "The others are Silent Chollima, which is involved in destructive attacks and is believed responsible for the hack that destroyed Sony computers in 2014.",
  "KNS / AFP - Getty Images\n\nKeeping sensitive information on computers disconnected from the internet is a primary method of defending it from hackers.",
  "Click here to read the report\n\nCrowdStrike, another top cyber security firm, told NBC News it identifies the group by the name \"Labyrinth Chollima.\"",

  "They are not just focused on espionage – we've seen them use it for attack, we've seen them use it for crime.",
