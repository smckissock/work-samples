  "It was already known that Clinton’s camp was aware of Guccifer’s hack of Blumenthal and took at least one step in response: changing Clinton's email address because it was exposed in messages in Blumenthal’s account.",
  "The response, dated July 11 and released Wednesday by Judicial Watch, was a follow-up to questions Mills declined to answer at a May deposition in a Freedom of Information Act suit brought by the group.",
