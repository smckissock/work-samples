  "A line from Thomas Pynchon’s novel The Crying of Lot 49 often came to mind as I contemplated the heady possibility of changing society digitally: “Shall I project a world?”\n\nBut the question I was afraid to ask him was this: If we were to achieve our goal, why should the world trust Facebook or Zuckerberg to shape and manage this new global meta-society?",
  "“We are building a social operating system,” colleagues would say, and when they said that, it sounded so neutral, so technically unbiased, like we were building a faster laptop instead of a machine capable of mediating the world’s personal relationships, not to mention political elections, with increasing levels of sophistication.",
  "Perhaps the reported internal rumblings at Facebook are evidence that some moral self-reflection is developing; on the other hand, reported employee comments likening anyone who questions or leaks information to “wife beaters and suicide bombers” suggests that the cultural atmosphere that abhors self-criticism is alive and well.",
  "As Facebook continued to grow, so did my concerns\n\nAs Facebook grew exponentially, smashing user milestones by the month, and the idea of domination started to become plausible, I started looking for signs that Zuckerberg and the Facebook culture at large were aware of the potential downsides to our unfettered growth.",
  "It doesn’t feel like it was very long ago that I was sitting, legs crossed, on the floor of a nondescript office building on University Avenue in Palo Alto, watching Mark Zuckerberg raise his fist with a slight smile and say, “Domination!” as a way of closing out our weekly Friday all-hands meeting.",
  "That year, Zuckerberg frequently wore a shirt that said “Sloths” on it, signaling an ironic laziness — to him, and to many of us, the idea of “domination” seemed as much a half-serious, half-joking fantasy as a hard-set mission.",
  "I was a former English graduate student turned Facebook employee, where I started working with user issues, then moved into product marketing and managing before finally, in 2009, becoming Zuckerberg’s speech and blog writer.",
  "Instead, internal conversations stayed focused on technical and growth questions; questions that can be answered with metrics — how fast are we growing and what technical roadblocks can we remove — rather than introspection.",
  "In the early days of Facebook, it was easy to dream big and hope for the best even while “moving fast and breaking things”; in many ways, we were more successful than anyone who worked there back then could have imagined.",
  "But Cambridge Analytica is a scandal that isn’t a scandal: Everyone who has ever worked on or with the Facebook platform knew that for several years, the platform made data available to third-party developers by design.",
  "One might think that a company breaking social media growth records would welcome dialogue about the product’s social impact, since we were essentially building an entirely new social and communications infrastructure.",
  "When asked about people who thought Apple was better at privacy, Zuckerberg claimed those customers had “Stockholm syndrome.”\n\nThen the Cambridge Analytica scandal happened, bringing all these questions home to roost.",
  "But whenever I had any doubts I would think, “Facebook has to be much bigger than it is now before ‘domination’ is anything to be afraid of.” And with that, I would throw myself back into the work of growing Facebook.",
  "Revelations that the company worked with the Trump campaign and the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom to use shadily harvested data from Facebook to target political ads has shaken the company’s public image.",
  "The Cambridge Analytica scandal brought all these questions to a head\n\nIf the takeaway from this to outside observers is that Facebook only cares about growth and profit above ethics, that’s not quite accurate.",
  "The culture of Facebook then and, as recent reporting suggests, now is one that — oddly, for a company built on the idea of wide-open communication — was somewhat immune to self-criticism or self-reflection.",
  "While in 2005 the site was growing rapidly with college users and had some of the best engagement numbers any venture capitalist had ever seen, it had yet to be released to the general public.",
  "We are probably focusing on the intelligence part and getting smart people here who lack a moral compass and loyalty,” as one Facebook employee put it recently in an internal discussion.",
  "Unlike a country, a company has unlimited potential to build and grow, I felt, and a social media company that transcended national boundaries could become a meta-society of its own.",
  "If my co-workers were asking themselves these same questions, I didn’t see it being discussed on our internal forum pages or in conversations around the office.",
  "This meant that not only did I need to understand the full scope of the mission, I needed to be able to argue it eloquently to others and foresee criticism.",
  "At the time, I felt that the biggest long-term threat to Facebook’s popularity was, ironically, becoming dominant to the point of overbearing monopoly.",

  "Could Zuckerberg, who wields considerable power over Facebook’s share structure, develop the self-awareness and responsibility to manage it?",
  "My worry began to deepen when, around this time, Zuckerberg began using the language of states to talk about Facebook’s burgeoning power.",
  "Every person who works at Facebook should also be looking in the mirror and thinking about what that means and asking the hard questions.",
  "But now that market dominance has been achieved and its risks are readily apparent, it’s time to set real limits on Facebook’s power.",
  "Still, Facebook doesn’t seem to have woken up to this moral quandary, at least in a way that is visible to the world watching.",
