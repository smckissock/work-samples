  "In the statement, editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and chairman Michael Goldfarb said that the publication retained Fusion GPS \"to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton.\"",
  "The conservative website the Washington Free Beacon triggered the research into then-candidate Donald Trump by Fusion GPS that eventually led to the now-infamous Trump \"dossier,\" the publication's editor-in-chief and chairman acknowledged in a statement Friday night.",
  "The research effort was known to have been supported by Republican allies before the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign picked up the tab for the research, but the original funder of the research was unknown until now.",
  "The Free Beacon says Steele was not involved in the research at the time of its involvement, and \"none of the work product that the Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier.\"",
  "The resulting dossier was compiled by former British spy Michael Steele and contained unsubstantiated allegations about then-candidate Trump's connections to Russia.",
  "It has never disclosed its owners or financial backers, but the New York Times reports hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer provides a large amount of its funding.",
  "The statement said representatives of his publication approached the House Intelligence Committee Friday and offered to answer questions.",
  "\"But to be clear: We stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods,\" Continetti and Goldfarb wrote.",
  "The Free Beacon also said it had no knowledge of the relationship between Fusion GPS and the DNC or Clinton campaign.",
  "The Free Beacon's connection to the dossier was first reported by the Washington Examiner's Byron York Friday night.",
  "The site covers national security issues, politics, culture and media criticism, among other topics.",
  "The site began as a non-profit entity before becoming a for-profit enterprise several years ago.",
  "The Free Beacon has retained third-party firms since its launch in 2012, the statement says.",
  "Here is the full statement from the Free Beacon:",
  "Mr. Trump has denied the allegations."
