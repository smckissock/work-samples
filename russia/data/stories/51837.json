  "\"If in fact this is China and they're targeting the type of information that we hear about - information regarding government employees, past and present - it's indicative of collecting intelligence that would allow them to have some added value as they target human beings in the future, trying to collect information, perhaps trying to penetrate U.S. government agencies,\" Shawn Henry said Friday on \"CBS This Morning.\"",
  "Henry, now president of the private Internet security firm CrowdStrike, said while there could be other actors, the government has long looked at China for targeting the commercial sector in search of intellectual property in research and development.",

  "CBS News\n\n\"Our networks are all inherently insecure, and the very information that we rely on every day is susceptible to being stolen or, more importantly, being destroyed,\" he said.",
  "\"We've got to learn how to better detect these attacks because we're not going to prevent people from getting in all the time,\" he said.",
  "A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington called the accusations \"not responsible and counterproductive.\"",
  "Henry said this attack is of significant concern because in the past, hackers have destroyed entire networks.",
  "While the scope of this attack is unprecedented, Henry said it shines a light on a much larger problem.",
  "The FBI is still assessing the impact of the breach that involves nearly every U.S. government agency.",
  "Henry said it's a positive thing officials are already speaking openly about the issue.",
  "At least 4 million current and former federal workers' information has been affected.",
  "Beijing says any allegations China was involved are irresponsible and unscientific.",
