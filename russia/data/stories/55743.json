  "Many news outlets with ties to foreign governments are required to similarly register, but the pressure on RT has angered Russian officials who have said they will retaliate with unspecified restrictions on U.S. news outlets.",

  "Solodovnikov, who reported a $670,000 annual salary, said the channel's purpose is to produce \"news, talk shows and entertainment programs that are designed merely to inform, not influence.\"",
  "Simonyan said that failure to fulfill the U.S. Department of Justice's request to register by Monday could have led to the arrest of RT's American director and the freezing of its accounts.",
  "According to the filing, the Washington-based production company registered as a foreign agent of ANO TV-Novosti, the Russian government entity that handles the broadcast of RT worldwide.",

  "\"Americans have a right to know who is acting in the United States to influence the U.S. government or public on behalf of foreign principals,\" he said in the statement.",
  "Russian state-funded TV channel RT has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent after pressure from the U.S. government, documents released Monday show.",
  "The law is most commonly applied to foreign lobbying efforts, but the Justice Department has also required registration by media outlets funded by foreign governments.",
