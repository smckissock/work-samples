  "One DOJ insider joked that Ohr might end up in “one of those offices without a phone.”\n\nFox News has also confirmed that Bruce Ohr, as the head of OCDETF, was directly involved with Project Cassandra, the interagency investigation spearheaded by the DEA that tracked a massive international drug and money laundering scheme allegedly run by Hezbollah.",
  "Those closest to Project Cassandra, including Derek Maltz, the now-retired supervisory DEA agent who was a major player in the operation, claim the project and its potential prosecutions were sidelined by senior Obama administration officials who didn't want to upset Iran in the lead-up to the historic nuclear deal with Tehran in 2015.",
  "Fox News first reported in December that Ohr had been demoted from the position of associate deputy attorney general, after it was revealed he had conducted undisclosed meetings with dossier author Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that produced the salacious document.",
  "He said in a statement last month: \"While I am hopeful that there were no barriers constructed by the last admission to allowing DEA agents to fully bring all appropriate cases under Project Cassandra, this is a significant issue for the protection of Americans.",
  "Sources close to the attorney general told Fox News that he was recently made aware of Ohr's role in Project Cassandra and that Sessions is personally involved in the review and frequently asks for updates.",

  "A Justice Department official demoted late last year for concealing his meetings with the men behind the anti-Trump “dossier” has been stripped of yet another title, Fox News has learned.",
  "At the time of his demotion, DOJ officials told Fox News that Bruce Ohr had been \"wearing two hats,\" and would fall back to his other title and portfolio – as head of OCDETF.",

  "Fox News also reported that his wife Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, specifically on research related to the dossier.",
