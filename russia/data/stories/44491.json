  "I wonder if we need an additional taxonomy that gets to the nature, rather the source, of the data: something like observable data, which is what am, do and buy; declared data, which is what I consciously and willingly tell you, with a clear understanding of why and what for; and something like derived/extracted data, which is the least transparent and most likely to create these controversies—that is, deriving how you’ll vote based on a personality test, targeting advertising based on your friend network, selling insights generated by scanning your inbox, etc.",
  "Thought leader interview series on Facebook and data privacy:\n\nAs Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies in front of Congress, I spoke with Peter Horst, Founder of CMO Inc and former CMO of Hershey and CapitalOne for his thoughts.",
  "High quality journalism is a largely dying business because of easy access to free digital alternatives, which make their money by selling the consumer rather than by creating a product worth paying for.",
  "The actions Cambridge Analytica took that we’re wringing our hands over are really only shades of nuance different from what marketers strive to do every day (minus the end-running policies part).",
  "Horst: When it comes to Facebook and the like, there’s no escaping the reality that as long as a service is free, consumers are the product: their eyeballs, attention and data.",
  "So we’ll need to very intentionally create better, clearer guidelines to keep marketers on the right and righteous path—before ham-handed government regulations try to do it.",
  "For every industry that arises on the back of consumer data, there’s likely another that’s sinking, and I worry that overall product quality levels suffer as a result.",
  "And yet, with the growing tidal wave called analytics/martech/AI, this is clearly another area where technology is way out ahead of philosophy, policy and regulations.",
  "Whatever it is, I think we’ll need to develop policies and strategies with less of a vendor view of the data, and more of a consumer consciousness view.",
  "So one industry grows while another withers, and we’re left with the new reality of Fake News, talking heads, and a generally less informed public.",
  "So the whole Cambridge Analytica situation will certainly not be the last time we see inappropriate invasion and leverage of personal information.",
  "This will inevitably create incentives to suck more and more information out of them to monetize in increasingly questionable ways.",
  "We’re used to thinking about data in terms of first, second and third party data, with guidelines for the appropriate use of each.",
  "Bruce Rogers: What’s your perspective on the issues surrounding consumer data privacy and the Cambridge Analytica issue.",
  "Horst: I have another worry about the business model called, “Free to the consumer in exchange for data and attention”.",
  "Peter Horst: I feel massively conflicted on the subject of consumer data, Facebook and the whole privacy debate.",
  "On the one hand, marketers live and die by the volume and acuity of the insights they can get their hands on.",
  "Rogers: How should marketers be thinking about Facebook going forward?",
  "Rogers: What’s your concern about this business model?",
  "The news industry is a great example."
