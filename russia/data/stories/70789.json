  "The attacks in the heart of Europe — combined with earlier incidents in Lebanon and Turkey, as well as the downing of a Russian airliner in Egypt — suggest the Islamic State is reaching beyond its base in Iraq and Syria, an expansion the West has feared.",
  "While U.S. officials said Obama viewed the attacks in France as an act of war, they cautioned he had no plans to overhaul his strategy for dismantling the Islamic State group and said he remained staunchly opposed to an American ground war in Syria.",
  "Among other leaders, U.S. President Barack Obama, left, and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron hold a minute of silence for the victims of Friday's Paris attacks prior to a session of the G-20 summit, in Antalya, Turkey, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015.",
  "European Union leader Donald Tusk called on G-20 leaders to show \"full determination\" against terrorism and urged cooperation to prevent terror financing — a step that nations have already been pursuing for more than a year.",
  "\"The skies have been darkened by the horrific attacks that took place in Paris just a day and a half ago,\" Obama said shortly after arriving in Antalya, a seaside resort city just a few hundred miles from the Syrian border.",
  "But hopes for a major breakthrough were softened by open questions about the proposal — such as Assad's future and the list of opposition groups to be deemed terrorists and barred from participating.",
  "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the summit host, pledged leaders would produce a \"strong message\" about fighting international terrorism, though he, too, did not spell out specific steps.",
  "\"We understand very well that it's only possible to deal with the terror threat and help millions of people who lost their homes by combining efforts of the entire global community,\" Putin said.",
  "The proposal appears to be based largely on a Russian initiative and envisions negotiations between embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad's government and opposition groups starting by Jan. 1.",
  "In addition to the terror threat, this year's G-20 agenda also included efforts to hasten global economic growth, with a particular focus on addressing the effects of China's economic slowdown.",
  "The conflict has stretched into its fifth year, left more than 250,000 people dead and 11 million displaced, and created a vacuum for the Islamic State and other extremist groups to thrive.",
  "Putin began launching airstrikes in Syria about a month ago, a campaign he says is aimed at the Islamic State group, but the U.S. views as an effort to strengthen Assad's grip on power.",
  "Putin urged nations to pool their efforts to combat terrorism, adding that the fight must respect international law, the U.N. Charter and each nation's sovereign rights and interests.",
  "Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the leaders share similar \"strategic goals\" for defeating the Islamic State extremists \"but tactical differences remain.\"",
  "In a draft of the final G-20 communique obtained by The Associated Press, leaders renewed their goal to grow their collective GDP by another 2 percent by 2018.",
  "The crisis in Syria was already expected to be on the leaders' agenda given an uptick in diplomatic maneuvering over ways to wind down Syria's civil war.",
  "In Turkey, five police officers were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up during a police raid on a suspected IS hideout near the Syrian border.",
  "The Paris violence ratcheted up the urgency at the previously scheduled Group of 20 summit, an annual meeting of leading rich and developing nations.",
  "Instead, they foreshadowed an expansion of steps the U.S. is already taking, namely airstrikes and train-and-equip missions for rebels inside Syria.",
  "But beyond the tough talk and calls for action, there was little indication of how leaders intended to escalate the assault on the extremist group.",
  "Obama and Putin huddled on the sidelines of the summit for 35 minutes to discuss the proposal, as well as Russia's military moves in Syria.",
  "According to a White House readout of the meeting, the U.S. president \"noted the importance of Russia's military efforts\" aimed at IS.",
  "Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said it was up to France whether to invoke Article 5 of the NATO charter.",
  "And United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the response should be \"robust, but always within the rule of law.\"",
