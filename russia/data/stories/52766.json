  "CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.”\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee found that the January 2017 assessment by the U.S. intelligence agencies “relies on public Russian leadership commentary, Russian state media reports, public examples of where Russian interests would have aligned with candidates’ policy statements, and a body of intelligence reporting to support the assessment that Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for Trump.”\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee said it “concurs with intelligence and open-source assessments that this influence campaign was approved by President Putin.”\n\nAsked whether he preferred Trump over Clinton in 2016, Putin said in Helsinki: “Yes, I did.",
  "Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.”\n\nShortly after Putin claimed that “the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs,” the Justice Department announced it had charged a 29-year-old Russian citizen in the United States with conspiring “to infiltrate organizations active in U.S. politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation without prior notification to the Attorney General.”\n\nThese charges don’t stem from Mueller’s investigation, but the defendant, Maria Butina, is accused of secretly working as an agent of the Russian government as she sought to influence U.S. politics.",
  "… I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.” Putin: “President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia with the American elections, and I had to reiterate things I said several times, including during our personal contacts, that the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process.”\n\nOverwhelming evidence shows that Russia orchestrated a campaign of cyberespionage and propaganda to interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2016.",
  "But the indictment leaves open the possibility that Russian government officials contributed to the Internet Research Agency’s efforts; it says the named defendants worked “together with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury.”\n\n“Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls,’” according to the January 2017 assessment by the U.S. intelligence community.",
  "The U.S. Treasury Department in 2016 imposed sanctions on Prigozhin and Concord over Russia’s occupation of Crimea and military actions in Ukraine, and then imposed more sanctions in March based on “malicious cyber-enabled activities.”\n\n“Prigozhin has extensive business dealings with the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, and a company with significant ties to him holds a contract to build a military base near the Russian Federation border with Ukraine,” the Treasury Department said in 2016 when it announced Prigozhin’s Ukraine-related sanctions.",
  "I think it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 emails.”\n\nThere’s no evidence Clinton deleted these 33,000 emails in anticipation of receiving a subpoena, and Comey has said the FBI’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.” Clinton’s staff had requested that these emails be deleted months before they received a subpoena, according to the FBI’s July 2016 statement.",
  "But the report said investigations “by other committees, the special counsel, the media, or interest groups will continue and may find facts that were not readily accessible to the Committee or outside the scope of our investigation.” Democrats on the panel strongly disagreed with the majority report’s conclusions, noting that there were many documented contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian individuals during the campaign.",
  "On June 3, 2016, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. offering “very high level and sensitive information” that could “incriminate Hillary.” Goldstone described this as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded, “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” Goldstone set up a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.",
  "“However, Russian government officials — including Putin’s top spokesman — knew Trump was in Moscow in November 2013 to host the Miss Universe pageant and were told about the real estate developer’s eagerness to meet with Putin while he was there, according to people familiar with the conversations who have recounted them to congressional investigators,” The Washington Post’s Rosalind S. Helderman reported.",
  "I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow.” Trump: “It would have been out long ago.”\n\nThis is most probably a reference to the “Steele dossier,” which included several scandalous and unsubstantiated allegations linking Trump to bribery and prostitutes in Russia.",
  "In 2017, Browder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that, from 1996 to 2005, his firm Hermitage Capital “was one of the largest investment advisers in Russia,” with “more than $4 billion invested in Russian stocks.” His investment firm “named and shamed” oligarchs who stole from shareholders — an effort, Browder said, that Putin initially supported.",
  "The Russian intelligence officers allegedly stole documents from these Democratic committees and strategically released them in the run-up to the election through a website they set up called “DCLeaks,” through a fictitious hacker persona they dubbed Guccifer 2.0, and through an organization not named in the indictment but widely reported to be WikiLeaks.",
  "“The memo Natalia Veselnitskaya provided to the Trump campaign last year [2016] focused on banker-turned-human rights activist Bill Browder, whose reputation has become inextricably linked to the global human-rights campaign he launched in 2009 after tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison,” Business Insider reported.",
  "Veselnitskaya said “she went to the New York meeting to show Trump campaign officials that major Democratic donors had evaded U.S. taxes and to lobby against the so-called Magnitsky law that punishes Russian officials for the murder of a Russian tax accountant who accused the Kremlin of corruption,” according to Bloomberg News.",
  "“Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on U.S. presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,” according to the U.S. intelligence community assessment from 2017.",
  "… We are now talking about private individuals, not about particular states.”\n\nBefore Mueller’s grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers working directly for Putin’s government, it indicted several Russian individuals working for a “troll farm” called the Internet Research Agency.",
  "“We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.”\n\nTrump: “There was no collusion at all.",
  "The DNC ultimately allowed CrowdStrike, a private company, to review its database and share findings with the FBI, which Comey testified “was an appropriate substitute.”\n\nCybersecurity expert Thomas Rid said that “handing over the server” as Trump described could have destroyed evidence.",
  "In one instance, the Russian officers “hacked the website of a state board of elections … and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters, including names, addresses, partial social security numbers, dates of birth, and driver’s license numbers,” the indictment alleges.",
  "Two Russian companies — called Concord Catering and Concord Management and Consulting — provided the Internet Research Agency with millions of dollars to buy digital ads and to pump pro-Trump and anti-Clinton messaging into the U.S. ecosystem in 2016, Mueller’s indictment alleges.",
  "The Mueller indictment describes in granular detail how the GRU officers used phishing techniques in 2016 to hack into the computer networks of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.",
  "The US passed the Magnitsky Act in 2012 that sanctioned high-level Russian officials accused of human rights abuses and corruption.”\n\nIt’s noteworthy that Putin, at the Helsinki news conference with Trump, brought up the same Browder-Magnitsky situation.",
  "“She didn’t have any and described the 20-minute meeting as a failure.”\n\nA memo she reportedly brought to the Trump Tower meeting was a close match with a document Russian prosecutors had written two months earlier and shared with a U.S. congressman.",
  "The New York Times reported that Prigozhin has received contracts from the Russian government worth $3.1 billion over the past five years, citing research by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a group set up by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.",
  "“Russia has been building additional military bases near the Ukrainian border and has used these bases as staging points for deploying soldiers into Ukraine.”\n\nIn Helsinki, Putin said Concord did not “represent” or “constitute” the Russian state.",
  "Several Trump advisers met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign, including Michael Flynn, who later resigned as Trump’s national security adviser for failing to fully disclose those contacts to Vice President Pence.",
  "Prosecutors said they found no evidence Awan “engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computers systems.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office that shot down these theories is led by Jessie K. Liu, a Trump nominee.",
  "Browder’s advocacy of Magnitsky’s case led Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which bars Russian officials believed to be involved in the accountant’s death from entering the United States or using its banking system.",
  "“The role of the intelligence community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the president and policymakers,” Coats said in a statement July 16 after Trump’s remarks in Helsinki.",
  "Former FBI director James B. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the FBI made “multiple requests at different levels” to access DNC’s servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access.",
  "“Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” the assessment says.",
  "“In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,” Comey said in July 2016.",
  "It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal.” (There’s no evidence that Browder or his associates contributed $400 million to Clinton’s campaign.)",
  "Three days before Trump and Putin’s summit, a grand jury convened by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers working for a military agency known as the GRU.",
  "Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, 2017, to lying to federal agents about his contacts with people with connections to the Russian government during the campaign.",
  "The lesson here is that there’s a mountain of evidence contradicting Putin’s claims of no interference at all in American politics — fresh evidence emerged the same day as this news conference.",
  "I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don’t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server.” Putin: “I’d like to add something to this.",

  "Trump was asked whether he believed the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the presidential election in 2016, or whether he believed Putin’s denials.",
  "The Washington Post reported that Manafort during the campaign “offered to provide briefings on the race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin,” Oleg Deripaska.",
  "On June 9, 2016, the meeting at Trump Tower with Veselnitskaya included Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump’s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, among others.",
  "And they’re going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign.” Putin: “Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion?",
  "The plea deal had nothing to do with his work on Capitol Hill, but federal prosecutors included an unusual passage that debunked several conspiracy theories about Awan’s work.",

  "Putin said the United States should help Russia investigate Browder, but he renounced his U.S. citizenship and resides in London.",
