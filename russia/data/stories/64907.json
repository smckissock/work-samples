  "WASHINGTON — Diplomats from Europe to East Asia watched the US midterm elections to see whether the outcome would provide some check on the Trump administration’s foreign policy, and in particular, his aggressive approach toward trade.",
  "As one Democratic congressional staffer put it, “I’m not sure there’s a whole lot House Democrats can do.” For example, it is the Senate and not the House that must approve treaties, though trade agreements do require both.",
  "But the congressional staffer noted that not all Europeans look to the United States to keep a multilateral world order together — some, in fact, have embraced Trump’s unilateral approach and tied their futures to his.",
  "“A lot of the Democrats have very good relations with Canada, [and are] very supportive of Canada.”\n\nCanada isn’t the only country whose officials noted that ties go beyond the Trump administration.",
  "Those leaders, the staffer said, may feel Tuesday’s change of leadership in the House is “just a little setback for the president, but his agenda will continue, and so they can, too.”",
  "He cited European leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán who have advocated populist policies similar to Trump’s, including a crackdown on immigration.",
  "Canada recently resolved a trade issue with the US by finally agreeing to a redone NAFTA deal, now known as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, or USMCA.",
  "Which put diplomats roughly back where they were before Tuesday: trying to deal with Trump’s opposition to multilateralism and his tough approach to trade.",
  "He noted that US–Canada relations transcend whatever the current state of Trump’s relationship might be with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "“There are a number of links and bonds that exist no matter if we agree” on other issues, such as the Iran nuclear deal, she said.",
  "“The senior members of the House who are going to be committee chairs — we know them all, we’ve worked with them,” he said.",
  "On trade and climate change, Europeans have turned to states and cities after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord.",
  "But MacNaughton was optimistic the USMCA would get congressional approval, allowing him to work on other, different issues.",
  "She noted that Germany invests heavily in the United States and sends students to the US on educational exchanges.",
  "But when the House flipped but the Senate did not, the answer was clear: Not much would change at all.",
  "German Ambassador Emily Haber alluded to those relationships at an event at the Hudson Institute.",
  "“It’s more or less business as usual,” Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton told BuzzFeed News.",
  "The Trump administration still has tariffs imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum imports.",
  "“What is Europe really looking for anyways?” one congressional staffer asked.",
  "The steel and aluminum tariffs eventually will be lifted, he said."
