  "Columbus Nova confirmed paying Essential Consultants for what it called services “regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.”\n\nThe firm denied that the Russian magnate, Viktor Vekselberg, was involved with hiring or paying Cohen, but there is no avoiding the bad optics: It looks as though a powerful Russian, and others, may have tried to curry favor with Trump by sending money to the shell company used by the president's fixer to make headaches such as Daniels go away.",
  "As special counsel Robert S. Mueller III probes possible links between Trump and Russia, disclosures like the one made Tuesday by Daniels's lawyer could weaken the president's claim to have “nothing to do with Russia.”\n\n[How money flowed through Michael Cohen’s multi-purpose shell company]\n\nAlso, records related to Daniels were among the documents sought by FBI agents who raided Cohen's office, home and hotel room last month as part of an investigation into possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations.",
  "In the latest development, Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti on Tuesday posted on Twitter a document purporting to show wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen created in October 2016 and used to represent Trump in negotiations with Daniels.",
  "According to the document, Essential Consultants received $500,000 from an investment firm called Columbus Nova, the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump's inauguration and was recently sanctioned by the U.S. government.",
  "On “Fox & Friends” last week, Rudolph W. Giuliani invited viewers to imagine what would have happened if Stormy Daniels had gone public in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign with her claim of a decade-old affair with Donald Trump.",
  "Three weeks before Daniels signed the nondisclosure agreement, The Washington Post published the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, on which Trump could be heard boasting about groping and kissing women without consent.",
  "At the time, other women were making worse accusations than Daniels, who says she had consensual sex with Trump at a golf tournament in 2006 and continued to see him and talk with him by phone in the ensuing months.",
  "[President Trump and accusations of sexual misconduct: The complete list]\n\nDaniels's story, however salacious, would have likely paled in comparison and merely reinforced the playboy image Trump once cultivated.",
  "What if the adult-film star had told her story on ABC's “Good Morning America,” as the Wall Street Journal reported she was in talks to do, before signing a $130,000 nondisclosure agreement in October 2016?",
  "After Trump denied during a debate that he had done what he talked about on the recording, multiple women came forward with accounts of unwanted touching and kissing by Trump.",
  "If Trump and Cohen participated in Giulani's exercise, and imagined that Daniels had gone public in October 2016, they might have wished she had.",
  "Such an appearance certainly wouldn't have helped Trump's electoral prospects, yet there is reason to think the damage would have been minimal.",
  "If Trump was unaware of the payment, then there wouldn't be any privileged communications between him and Cohen, related to Daniels, right?",
  "Now, however, Daniels has become a bigger problem than Trump or the lawyer who arranged the payoff, Michael Cohen, could have foreseen.",
  "And Trump may have facilitated the warrant needed to execute the raid by publicly denying any knowledge of the payment to Daniels.",
  "Paying for her silence may have caused more trouble than letting her talk would have.",
  "So let's imagine."
