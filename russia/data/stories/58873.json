  "And in fact, what we learned last week gets us closer to collusion -- or, in the criminal context, conspiracy -- then anything we've known to date: Michael Cohen making clear he is willing to tell Mueller that Trump knew about the June 2016 meeting between Russians and his top campaign staff before it happened.",
  "Back in February, CNN reported this : \"For the first time, US investigators say they have corroborated some of the communications detailed in a 35-page dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent, multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials tell CNN.\"",
  "Five people have already pleaded guilty in relation to the probe and several are now cooperating with Mueller, including former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates.",
  "While Trump repeats \"no collusion\" like it's his personal mantra, the reality is that we simply don't know whether there was any collusion by anyone in the Trump campaign with any Russians -- and Trump couldn't possibly know either.",
  "\"Was started by a fraudulent Dossier\"\n\nTrump, as he often does, suggests that the only reason the Mueller probe exists is because of a \"fraudulent dossier\" on him put together by former British spy Christopher Steele.",
  "\"The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC.",
  "As for the idea of a \"rigged witch hunt,\" no one who is not directly on Trump's payroll -- or whose name is Devin Nunes -- describes what Mueller is doing in anything close to those terms.",
  "It is worth noting here, as I did above, that Mueller, who runs the probe, was appointed by Republicans to both the FBI and the special counsel role -- and is personally a Republican.",
  "As to the \"scam,\" it's important to remember that Mueller has issued 191 criminal charges against 32 individuals and three companies in the course of the special counsel probe.",
  "Of the 17 people we know are members of Mueller's special counsel team, 13 have been previously registered as Democrats, according to The Washington Post's Matt Zapotosky .",
  "While the more salacious details in it have not been confirmed by the US intelligence community, there are elements of the dossier that have in fact been corroborated.",
  "\"Headed by now 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats\"\n\nThere's a whole lot of exaggerating and assumption going on here.",
  "And despite its relative brevity, there are at least seven examples of exaggerations, mischaracterizations and outright falsehoods contained in it.",
  "The Free Beacon ended its funding in May 2016, at which point, the DNC and the Clinton campaign picked up the funding for Fusion GPS's work.",
  "\"The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt\"\n\nMueller was initially appointed as the head of the FBI by Republican President George W. Bush.",
  "Rosenstein had addressed the partisan composition of the special counsel team in testimony before Congress earlier this year .",
  "The Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS, a research firm, to build up a dossier on Trump during the 2016 Republican primary process.",
  "\"Paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC\"\n\nTrump's description of the funding for the Steele dossier is woefully incomplete.",
  "The initial funding for the so-called \"dossier' came from The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media website.",
  "\"I don't think it's a witch hunt,\" said South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy , a Republican, earlier this month.",
  "He was named special counsel by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general in the Trump administration.",
  "As he writes of the donations: \"The majority came from one person, who also contributed to Republicans.",
  "That tweet totals 47 words (and 277 characters -- sliding just under Twitter's 280-character limit).",
  "I believe that Director Mueller understands that and that he is running that office appropriately.\"",
  "The other four were either unaffiliated voters or their party affiliations couldn't be determined.",
  "Of the 17, nine have donated money in the past to Democrats, again according to Zapotosky.",
  "\"And it's our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions.",
  "What we can say is that there is no public evidence yet released that proves collusion.",
  "\"The witch hunt is an illegal scam\"\n\nI have zero idea what Trump means by \"illegal.\"",
  "Second, Trump's assertion that the entire dossier is \"fraudulent\" is inaccurate.",
  "(It's not at all clear how/why Trump is saying all 17 are \"Angry Democrats.\")",
  "Six donated to Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the 2016 race.\"",
  "\"There is No Collusion,\" wrote the President of the United States .",
  "\"We recognize we have employees with political opinions,\" he said.",
  "After all, this probe is being run by his Justice Department.",
  "\"There is no collusion\"\n\nThis is, at best, an opinion.",
  "It's not clear what law they would be/are breaking.",
  "Trump has continued to insist he knew nothing.",
  "Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\"",
  "At that point, Fusion GPS hired Steele on.",
  "\"I've never thought it was a witch hunt.\"",
  "That's one for every seven words!",
  "Mueller himself is a Republican.",
  "That's not right on two counts.",
  "Let's go through them!",
