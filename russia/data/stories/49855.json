  "DELURY: Yes, I think the big point of caution -- and people are talking about this -- is the meaning of denuclearization -- or not necessarily -- it's not about the definition of denuclearization, it's we have to have realistic expectations of how quickly Kim Jong-un give up parts of that program, start moving in the opposite direction from developing the capabilities to dismantling the capabilities.",

  "MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know there's been a lot of them, at least 23 countries have had their ambassadors called to the Russian foreign ministry here in Moscow, handed letters by foreign ministry officials and then told a various number of diplomats from each country has been expelled in response to the expulsions for those countries of Russian diplomats.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nFIELD: And, George, there's obviously a lot of symbolism here that's significant to be sending a large delegation like this over the DMZ, one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world, flying right over that into Pyongyang to put on a show on Sunday night and to also join with North Korean performers to put on another show on Tuesday.",

  "The big question, Natalie, of course, is whether this show of international unity or at least the Western unity in the face of this alleged Russian action will be enough to give Russia pause for thought, whether it will cease in what many in the West believe is Russia's strategy of confrontation or whether it will antagonize Russia even further.",

  "If this diplomatic spat produces the result that many in the West want, which is that Russia ceases to be so confrontational over a range of issues, not just this alleged chemical weapons poisoning, but issues from Syria to Ukraine to various other things in the international diplomacy, then this could very well be the end of it.",
