  "Then-General Khalifa Haftar speaks during a news conference at a sports club in Abyar Thomson Reuters\n\nAnd following Haftar's successful takeover of the oil terminals in Libya's Sirte basin over the last two months, and his hard line against Islamist groups in Benghazi, the West currently appears to have accepted the reality — and, to an extent, the necessity — of his power and, by extension, Russia's influence in Libya.",
  "Gauging the success of Putin's strategy really depends on the time frame: In 2016, Russia is up in the Middle East; in the longer term, the damage he has done to the Russian economy by breaking with the West will outweigh the value of an alliance with the likes of eastern Libya or even perhaps Turkey.",

  "In Syria, despite human rights atrocities by the Syrian government that have attracted Western scorn, the West has not been able to explain how getting rid of Bashar al-Assad's regime would improve the country's security, since that could lead to a rise in Islamist anarchy.",
  "Despite being on different sides of the Syrian civil war, Putin has managed to bring Riyadh into its diplomatic orbit through cooperation on oil policy, given how both Saudi-led OPEC states and Russia need substantially higher prices for government budgets to break even.",
  "Vladimir Putin and Abdel Fattah al-Sisi REUTERS/Alexei Druzhinin\n\nSince 2013, Russia has stepped in to provide arms to the Egyptian government, exploiting U.S. reluctance to provide military hardware that could be used for domestic political repression.",
  "Murad Sezer/Reuters\n\nLikewise, Putin's attempt to carve out a role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process this year, which appears primarily designed to challenge the United States as the key broker, is not likely to result in any breakthrough.",
  "Putin attends a meeting with members of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights in Moscow Thomson Reuters In his masterful account Strategy: A History, Sir Lawrence Freedman defines strategy as \"the art of creating power.\"",
  "Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin\n\nMoscow has voiced commitment to such cooperation, and the Saudis appear to have bought into this assurance — for without it, Russia could simply gobble up much of any market share conceded by a Saudi production cut.",

  "Apart from its close ties to the Syrian regime, which date back to the 1970s, Moscow has had no substantial role in the Middle East since 1972, when President Anwar Sadat kicked Soviet advisors out of Egypt.",
  "Recall for example that the propaganda value the Russians attached to a Syria bombing raid from an Iranian base in August irritated Tehran, and the Russians were kicked off the base three days later.",
  "It's possible that Putin believed his actions in the Middle East would give him leverage to bargain sanctions away, despite the fact that Ukrainian and Syrian sanctions are not formally linked.",
  "If anything, Putin has boxed Russia into a position where it must increasingly orient its economy toward China, and away from the West, which gives Beijing considerable leverage over Moscow.",
  "As any demagogue knows, the only way to maintain power generated out of nothing through division is to keep stoking the flames of perpetual conflict upon which these divisions depend.",

  "The problem is that the separatist government in Tobruk in eastern Libya, which is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, has not agreed to this merger.",

  "As for Libya, the United States is invested in the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord, based out of Tripoli, which seeks to unify a divided country.",
  "Perpetual conflict abroad clearly helps rally popular support among Russians to keep Putin entrenched in the Kremlin, even as his country rots around him.",
  "In the short term, the official announcement of an OPEC-Russia oil production deal, which is expected to come this month, will temporarily lift prices.",
