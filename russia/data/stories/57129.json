  "Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told The Daily Caller Monday that Trump should direct the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether Mueller, as FBI director, oversaw a “cover up.”\n\nThe Hill reported that in 2009 the FBI “gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.”\n\nNo charges were brought by federal officials and Russian firm Uranium One purchased a Canadian firm that controlled around 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.",
