  "Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing “25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad” and 51% of those polled, “agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.”\n\nTrump reiterated in the statement that America must understand radical Islam before allowing Muslims into the country.",
  "Presidential candidate Donald Trump is calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”\n\nIn a statement released Monday, Trump pointed to a poll from Center for Security Policy to show that segments of the Muslim population detest Americans.",
  "Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.",
  "Also, two million people from Muslim-majority countries were admitted to the United States since the jihad atrocity on 9/11, 2001.",
  "According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.",
  "The federal government is set to increase their population in the United States up to 6.2 million by 2030.",
  "For example, a record 680,000 migrants from Muslims countries were granted Green Cards from 2009 to 2013.",
  "Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension.",
  "However, lopsided majorities of Americans strongly oppose the migration of Muslims to the United States.",
  "Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine."
