  "Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads.",
  "The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app.",
  "Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.",
  "\"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.",
  "The social media network is under fire after political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 50 million of its users, with the goal of influencing the 2016 presidential election.",
  "\"People have to expressly agree to use this feature,\" the statement said, in part, and noted: \"We never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.\"",
  "For instance, data about consumers posted by friends and family members will remain with the service as long as they remain on the social-media service, according to Facebook's Help Center.",
  "\"Keep in mind that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account,\" Facebook says in its data policy.",
  "There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks.",
  "Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store.",
  "The role of manufacturers of Android phones for protecting user privacy remains unclear, South Korean mobile device maker LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.",
  "\"Privacy is everyone's responsibility - software providers, carriers, as well as device manufacturers,\" said LG, whose smartphones run on the Android operating system.",
  "Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs.",
  "Since the data-privacy scandal emerged, some consumers have jumped on the #DeleteFacebook movement in order to protest Facebook's data collection issues.",
  "A Google spokesperson was unable to say how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers.",
  "Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs.",
  "Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.",
  "The revelation that Facebook kept users' logs, first reported by Ars Technica, raises new questions about the company's use of personal data.",
  "Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.",
  "Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.",
  "The news that Facebook's (FB) Android app has been gathering call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant.",
  "Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will.",
  "But it wasn't always clear what they were consenting to—and whether the users knew Facebook would keep that information indefinitely.",
  "It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions.",
  "\"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" it said.",
  "But just why was Facebook able to collect records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?",
  "\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research.",
  "And messages you've sent to a friend on Facebook would remain stored on Facebook's computers, the company said.",
  "Once users agreed to grant access, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.",
  "That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.",
  "(Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)",
  "Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.",
  "As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017.",
  "Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\"",
  "Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users.",
  "Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.",
  "\"If hardware played a role in the breach then we will certainly look into solution options.\"",
  "Until recently, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs.",
  "But some data may remain with the service even after consumers delete their accounts.",
  "But the company released a statement on Sunday detailing its call logging feature.",
  "That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information.",
  "But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software.",
  "\"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"",
  "There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones.",
  "Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics.",
  "All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts.",
  "And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?",
  "But it required them to agree to all those permissions at once.",
  "As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.",
  "Facebook's access to those logs required user consent.",
  "In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.",
  "Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.",
  "Why did Google set up Android permissions this way?",
  "All that leaves two big questions unanswered.",
  "CBS News' Thom Craver contributed reporting.",
  "But users had to opt in to make it possible.",
  "But Android has long been more indulgent.",
  "The company declined to comment further.",
  "Did Facebook scrape SMS and phone logs?",
  "How widespread is the issue?",
  "Well, it's complicated."
