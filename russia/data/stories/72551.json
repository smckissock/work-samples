  "The statement said VEB's management had met with \"a number of representatives of the largest banks and business circles of the U.S.,\" a claim supported by the Times's reporting about Mr. Gorkov's meetings with banks in New York.",
  "and congressional investigators are now scrutinizing whether Mr. Kushner may have met with Mr. Gorkov to help establish a direct line to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, or for other reasons not cited by the White House.",
  "Three years ago, in response to Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have effectively kept it from taking on most new business in the United States.",
