  "Given Facebook’s data mining capabilities and ever-growing set of user information, the costs of complying with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation are likely well worth it for the company.",

  "While the company’s management may have become relatively conservative in its growth outlook, advertisers will likely continue to find many use cases to leverage Facebook’s ubiquity and data.",
  "While the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal led to a consensus downgrade of Facebook’s earning potential, the company continues to pursue alternative avenues of ad delivery.",

  "As an example, LEGO achieved a 3.4x higher return on ad spend through messenger ads relative to what it would get from ads on its website.",
  "Notably, at Facebook’s scale of over 2 billion MAUs, each dollar improvement in EV/MAU impacts the market cap by over $2 billion.",
  "Over the years, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) has amassed huge amounts of demographic and behavioral data about users across the globe.",
  "The appeal of Facebook’s messenger ads has become evident from the improved return on investment for advertisers.",
  "One of the recent initiatives was Facebook attempting to procure user data from large banks."
