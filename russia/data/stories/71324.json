  "Analysis: Trump demands risk widening rift with allies\n\nThe Trump administration's agreement to waive sanctions again came with an enormous caveat and \"ask\" list, said CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh\n\nIn a bizarre kicker in the waiver announcement, the United States indicated it hopes to rewrite much of the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and to get its European allies, who wholly back the deal as it is, to do the bargaining for them, he said.",
  "JUST WATCHED Two years of Trump panning the Iran deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Two years of Trump panning the Iran deal 02:04\n\nThis approach is unlikely to work, given that it places the onus upon allies -- who publicly don't want to alter or jeopardize the deal -- to tighten it up in ways Iran will find unacceptable, Paton Walsh said.",
  "The United States proposes removing clauses that suggest parts of the deal expire after 10 to 15 years and tying long-range missile technology to nuclear weapons -- meaning testing the former would be seen as a similar sin to developing the latter.",
  "The US sanctions also targeted two other Iranian officials whom the administration said are responsible for ordering abuses against citizens, including the denial of medical care and access to legal representation for protesters in Iranian jails.",

  "Serious impact predicted\n\nThe sanctioning of Larijani, the most prominent of the US targets, could have \"serious political impact inside Iran,\" a senior Trump administration official predicted Friday.",
  "Many of those sanctions -- including one targeted at Larijani -- came in response to the Iranian government's crackdown on peaceful protests that have swept the country in recent weeks.",
  "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow has a \"very negative stance\" on the decisions and comments made by Trump about Iran, according to state news agency Sputnik.",
  "The United States has offered its allies a chance to \"rescue\" a deal nobody else thinks is broken, widening the rift between Trump and much of the rest of the world, Paton Walsh said.",
  "In short, Trump's pedigree in real estate negotiation is being used to try to recast one of the most complex and geopolitically vital documents on the planet, Paton Walsh said.",
  "\"We are also targeting Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities, which it continues to prioritize over the economic well-being of the Iranian people.\"",

  "Senior administration officials said Larijani has overseen the sentencing and execution of juveniles in Tehran.",
  "These and other sanctions also continue to divert investors from sinking money into Iran's vulnerable economy.",
  "It means the theater of Trump and Iran will continue for another few months.",
