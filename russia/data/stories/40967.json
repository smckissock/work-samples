  "The authors of the National Security Council report “NSC-68,” the 1950 blueprint for U.S. rearmament, had made this point explicitly: boosting Pentagon spending would “increase the gross national product by more than the amount being absorbed for additional military and foreign assistance purposes.” Building up the nation’s defenses could serve as a sort of permanent economic stimulus program, putting people to work and money in their pockets.",
  "“Every gun that is made,” Eisenhower told his listeners, “every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” Any nation that pours its treasure into the purchase of armaments is spending more than mere money.",
  "Endorsing the speech as “one of the most notable policy statements of U.S. history,” Time reported with satisfaction that Eisenhower had articulated a broad vision for peace and “left it at the door of the Kremlin for all the world to see.” The likelihood that Stalin’s successors would embrace this vision was nil.",
  "“It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.” To emphasize the point, Eisenhower offered specifics:\n\nThe cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities … We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat.",
  "An editorial in The New Republic made the essential point: as seen from Russia’s perspective, Eisenhower was “demanding unconditional surrender.” The president’s peace plan quickly vanished without a trace.",
  "As bookends to Eisenhower’s presidency, they form a solemn meditation on the implications—economic, social, political, and moral—of militarizing America.",
  "By diverting social capital from productive to destructive purposes, war and the preparation for war deplete, rather than enhance, a nation’s strength.",
  "Separated in time by eight years, the two speeches are complementary: to consider them in combination is to discover their full importance.",
  "Delivered in the wake of Joseph Stalin’s death, the speech offered the new Soviet leadership a five-point plan for ending the Cold War.",
  "At the time, the idea that militarizing U.S. policy might yield economic benefits outweighing the costs seemed eminently plausible.",
  "Military Keynesianism—the belief that the production of guns could underwrite an endless supply of butter—was enjoying its heyday.",
  "And while assertions of military necessity might camouflage the costs entailed, they can never negate them altogether.",
  "As much as they liked Ike, Americans had no intention of choosing between guns and butter: they wanted both.",
  "The essence of this theme was simplicity itself: spending on arms and armies is inherently undesirable.",
  "Largely overlooked by most commentators was a second theme that Eisenhower had woven into his text.",
  "Yet, as befit a Kansan and a military professional, Ike could speak plainly when he chose to do so.",
  "We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.",
  "Even when seemingly necessary, it constitutes a misappropriation of scarce resources.",
  "Yet in Cold War Washington, Eisenhower’s was a voice crying in the wilderness.",
  "During Eisenhower’s presidency, few credited him with being a great orator.",
  "The experience of World War II had apparently validated this theory.",
  "The April 16 speech early in his presidency was such a moment.",
  "Why shouldn’t the same logic apply to the Cold War?"
