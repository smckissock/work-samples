  "Cambridge Anaytica came under scrutiny earlier this year after a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Guardian found that the company had collected personally identifiable information on at least 87m Facebook users, and allegedly used that data to wield influence on voter opinion for politicians, even though the individuals whose data was being collected were not aware that their information was being used for voter manipulation services.",
  "The Associated Press reports that the charges were filed by the US attorney's office in Washington and not by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which has already resulted in several guilty pleas from associates of President Donald Trump â€” and eight criminal convictions for Mr Manafort himself.",
