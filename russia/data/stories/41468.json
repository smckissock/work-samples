  "If you were human, I’d risk offending you by saying this, but you're anything but, so who cares: on behalf of my particular faction of “Game of Thrones” fans—the Littlefinger enthusiasts, the Tarly-ites, the supporters of the Targaryen restoration—I hope that, in the season finale this Sunday, Dany flies to Hardhome on Drogon and has him breathe C.G.I.",
  "Some of you are “super-fresh,” dead for a week or two, your flesh only beginning to fall off; some are “mid-decomps,” dead six months to two years, and looking terrible; and some are greenscreen wights, dead as a doornail with decomp to match, rattling around full of negative space.",
  "I admit that you got me when you killed all those wildlings, let them lie around for a minute, and then conjured them up again, like a yoga instructor post-Namaste, while staring menacingly at poor Jon Snow as he fled in his little rowboat.",
  "Your triumphant appearance in the “Game of Thrones” episode “Hardhome,” after seasons of teasing, was a coup, a set piece, a breathtaking, daze-inducing experience so pleasurable that it transcended what was already transcendent.",
  "Or the Meereen fighting-pit melee from “Dance of Dragons,” last week: the life-saving surprise spear throw, the gold-faced Sons of the Harpy, popping up and terrifying us all, the joyful stabbing and the screams of the victims.",
  "He’s an appealing no-goodnik—a warm yet cruel whorehouse magnate who “would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.” In short, he’s dramatically realized, and a human, and is therefore everything you are not.",
  "I’m not a zombie connoisseur, but to me, all of you nincompoops, however brilliantly executed, have the emotional pull of an army of ants, minus the ants’ dignified social structures and attractive formic-acid exoskeletons.",
  "“Game of Thrones,” which is part fantasy, is also mostly a drama, and those of us who are there for the drama, White Walker Army, and for the comedy, such as it is, rate you very low on the emotional-realism scale.",
  "And next season, that settled, we can get back to people flaying their enemies, selling cockleshells to advance obscure revenge plots, romancing their siblings, and poisoning each other at weddings.",
  "Even Jon Snow, who, as several characters reminded us, has a pretty face and a sympathetic backstory, isn’t enough to provide all the human intrigue in a scene with seven million undead C.G.I.",
  "Wights, when I see thousands of you, your gray, gristled skeletons scampering over a cliff like a throng of bipedal lemmings and crashing to the ground, motionless—Hey, you’re dead!",
  "It’s the entire tradition of long, boring fight scenes in movies, on TV, everywhere, made more stultifying by recent years’ onslaught of visual effects, able to conjure anything.",
  "We dread your appearance not just because you threaten Jon Snow and his cohorts but because you threaten to drag the show we love further into a realm that we find tedious.",
  "Plenty of those people must find zombie battles exciting, whole fields of yuckos scrapping and yelling and dying; to me, they’re just a lot of frantic silliness.",
  "To Jon Snow and his ragtag, reluctant band of allies, you’re a formidable enemy, an unstoppable harbinger of death; to TV critics, you’re a horrifying thrill.",
  "Tyrion, Joffrey, Davos Seaworth; ships fighting with a castle; alchemical “wildfire” shooting through the air, making ships burst into green flames.",
  "I’m sure they enchant some of us, including their creators: you wights, for example, appear in various lovingly rendered stages of decomposition.",
  "But there are, in the world of entertainment, some satisfying battles—even a few decent massacres—and most lack zombies or wights.",
  "Mayor Carcetti—or Littlefinger, as he’s known in this corner of the HBO kingdom—could teach you a thing or two, White Walker Army.",
  "I’ll never hate you like I hated King Joffrey or Ramsay Bolton or that freaky Jocasta who got shoved through the moon door.",
  "You there, with the icy face and the glowing antifreeze eyes and the Billy Idol head spikes—I scoff at your whole vibe.",
  "; zillions of them strap on headsets to kill friends and strangers in live-shooter video games all over the world.",
  "The folly of man and his little plans, something bigger than Westeros and its politics and its throne wars!",
  "Can’t you hear us growling and snarling like direwolves, tigers, alligators, professional tennis players?",
  "Dear White Walkers and Your Thousands of Undead Wights:\n\nI get it—you’re scary and disgusting.",
  "But what about this Mag Nuk-speaking giant who’s whacking us with a flaming log?, you wonder.",
  "No, you’re not!—and then popping back up again, waiting to kill and be re-killed, I sigh.",
  "He raises the stakes a bit, doesn’t he, this freaky Free Folk creep with the penis face?",
  "Or the Battle of Blackwater, on “Game of Thrones.”\n\nRemember that, White Walker Army?",
  "The White Walkers will shatter; the North will be paved with dragonglass.",
  "But I’m not interested in what you’re up to; your evil doesn’t matter.",
  "But we represent the very destruction of all mankind!, you protest.",
  "As a friend texted me recently, “It’s turning into a video game.",
  "We might even represent climate change—try to stop that, eh?",
  "So is getting stuck in traffic—you think it will never end.",
  "The ice battle in “Alexander Nevsky,” for example.",
  "I want to see more of Mayor Carcetti.”\n\nWe all do.",
  "To be fair, White Walker Army, it’s not just you.",
  "To me, however, you’re a snooze factor eleven.",
  "Our hero was wounded, but he saved the day.",
  "flames on you and everything you inhabit.",
  "Many people love battle scenes and C.G.I.",
  "(You watch “Game of Thrones,” right?)",
  "White Walkers, don’t get me started.",
  "I play a little Words with Friends.",
  "Because there were people in it.",
  "But oh, the grunting!, you say.",
  "Yours truly,\n\nSarah Larson",
  "(And, O.K., a dragon.)",
  "That was a thrill too.",
  "Now that was a battle.",
  "(The Prokofiev helps.)",
  "Nope: he stinks too.",
  "Oh, you’re still on.",
  "That was effective.",
  "Yep, that works.",
  "Enough, already.",
  "Is VENOE a word?",
  "Apparently not.",
  "It’s terrible.",
  "Death itself!",
  "You know why?",
  "Yes, I know.",
  "Scary stuff.",
  "Sure I can.",
  "assholes.",
  "Is NOVAE?"
