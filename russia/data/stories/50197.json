  "A laptop showing the Facebook logo is held alongside a Cambridge Analytica sign at the entrance to the building housing the offices of Cambridge Analytica | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Facebook to be fined £500,000 in Cambridge Analytica data scandal The social networking giant hit with its first penalty for data privacy violations, and many other probes are still under way.",
  "Over the last 18 months, roughly 40 investigators have progressively extended that probe into other political uses of people's online data, including revelations earlier this year that a third-party app developer with ties to Cambridge Analytica inappropriately collected data on up to 87 million Facebook users worldwide.",
  "Brexit campaign probe\n\nThe social networking giant was not the only one on Wednesday to come under scrutiny by the British regulator, which began its investigation into the use of data in political campaigns early last year, focusing on the potential misuse of personal information during the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
  "As part of an ongoing investigation into the use of data by political groups, Elizabeth Denham, the U.K.'s Information Commissioner, or ICO, said Facebook broke the country's data protection rules by making users' information available to a third-party app linked to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm.",
  "\"The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica conundrum has created a lot of open investigations into data protection and electoral law,\" said David Carroll, an American professor whose requests for information from the data analytics firm led to the U.K. regulator's actions against SCL Elections on Wednesday.",
  "As part of its announcement Wednesday, the U.K. watchdog said it had begun a criminal prosecution of SCL Elections, another data analytics firm with ties to Cambridge Analytica, over claims that it had not handed over evidence related to a potential misuse of data.",
  "The social networking giant faces a fine of a half a million pounds in Britain for failing to protect people's online data connected to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, according to a report published by the country's privacy watchdog on Wednesday.",
  "Damian Collins, the British lawmaker leading a parliamentary investigation into the political use of data, said Facebook should provide more information on other third-party apps that also may have harvested people's data without their knowledge.",
  "In response, Facebook said it had taken steps against Cambridge Analytica in 2015 to shut down inappropriate collection of data, and that it is working with U.K. and other countries' authorities in ongoing investigations around the world.",
  "The regulator added that it is in the final stages of determining whether Vote Leave, the official group leading the campaign to leave the European Union, broke U.K. privacy rules by transferring data outside of the country.",
  "The £500,000 fine, which is the largest financial penalty the regulator can levy, \"sends a clear signal that I consider this as a significant issue if you look at the impact of the data breach,\" she added.",
  "If the abuse had occurred under Europe's new privacy standards, which came into force on May 25, the company could have been subject to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in financial penalties.",
  "In recent years, lawmakers have turned to social media platforms to target potential voters, and the U.K. regulator is concerned that some of their data-harvesting tactics may be unlawful.",
  "The British watchdog also sent letters to the country's main political parties to demand that they submit to an audit of their data practices, according to the report.",
  "Other data investigations into Leave.eu, another campaign group, and into parties connected to keeping the U.K. inside the EU during the Brexit referendum are ongoing.",
  "The companies have denied that they misused people's Facebook data to sway either the Brexit referendum, 2016 U.S. presidential election or other campaigns worldwide.",
  "Facebook also was not transparent about how people's digital information would then be used by these companies, particularly in relation to political campaigns.",
  "\"If other developers broke the law we have a right to know, and the users whose data may have been compromised in this way should be informed,\" he said.",
  "\"It's the most important investigation that the ICO has ever undertaken,\" said Denham, in reference to the final conclusions to be published in October.",
  "\"Facebook has failed to provide the protections required under data protection laws,\" Denham told reporters ahead of the report's publication.",
  "AggregateIQ, another data firm with ties to Cambridge Analytica, was also ordered Wednesday to stop processing data it held on U.K. citizens.",
  "Collins' parliamentary committee will publish its own report later this month on online misinformation and data use in political campaigns.",
  "Denham said it would be difficult to prove categorically that people's data had been misused to sway voters during the 2016 vote.",
  "The regulator's final report, including whether data was misused in the Brexit referendum, will be published in October.",
  "The financial penalty would represent the first levy worldwide against the tech giant for its role in the alleged abuse.",
  "\"We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon,” said Erin Egan, the company's chief privacy officer.",
  "So far, officials have not stated publicly if either side of the 2016 vote has broken the country's privacy rules.",
  "The fine is a mere rounding error compared to Facebook's $5.9 billion profit in the first three months of 2018.",
  "A decision on whether to take legal action in that case would be made by October, according to the watchdog.",
  "Facebook has the right to respond to the regulator's fine before a final decision is made in the case.",
  "In particular, at least two British political parties used data software to predict voters' ethnicity.",
  "\"The engagement of political parties is important,\" said Steve Wood, the ICO's deputy commissioner.",
  "Earlier this year, both SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy.",
  "\"It's been remarkable that the U.K. has provided jurisdiction for a U.S.",
  "The watchdog did not name which groups had carried out such practices.",
  "\"It's in their interest to take this seriously.\"",
  "\"It's an important moment for data protection.\"",
