  "But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.”\n\nIn that same Times interview, Zuckerberg addressed whether he’s worried people will abandon Facebook, as some have threatened to do.",
  "So it’s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.”\n\nHe also discussed whether or not Facebook would consider rethinking its advertising-based revenue model given the risks presented by sharing data with third parties:\n\n“That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time.",

  "I think there’s this really interesting question of: Now that companies increasingly over the next five to 10 years, as AI tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that?",
  "If that’s me, then I am happy to go.”\n\nIn that same CNN interview, Zuckerberg discussed plans to alert people who may have been affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal:\n\n“One of the most important things that I think we need to do here is to make sure we tell everyone whose data was affected by one of these rogue apps.",

  "Zuckerberg’s media appearances come as lawmakers in the United Stats and the U.K. are demanding he testify on the matter, while some are calling for Facebook to be better regulated.",
  "So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?",
  "We may not have all of the data in our system today, so anyone whose data might have been affected by this, we’re going to make sure that we tell.",
  "We’ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now.",
  "And anyone who either has a ton of data or something unusual, we’re going to take the next step of having them go through an audit.",
  "can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at.",
  "And it created some, but I think what the clear feedback was from our community was that people value privacy a lot more.",
  "That, I think, is probably one of the most interesting intellectual and social debates around how you regulate this.",
  "Like, that either requested data in spurts, or requested more data than it seemed like they needed to have.",

  "But we’ll send in teams, who will go through their servers and just see how they’re handling data.",
  "“I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good.",
  "a process where we could more accurately reflect the values of the community in different places.",
