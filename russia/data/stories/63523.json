  "The younger Sanders is not a fan of “identity politics” (at least as practiced by MSNBC host Joy Reid), thinks that criticisms of “white privilege” are ill-advised and turn off “working-class” voters, says he doubts the working class would care if Donald Trump were caught on camera calling people “niggers,” worries that eliminating Confederate flag license plates “hurts people’s rights,” and (you saw this one coming a mile away) has expressed exhaustion over Chelsea Clinton’s continued public presence:\n\nhttps://t.co/8xCKcgxkyf She engages in identity politics and alienates so many who are low income and working class.",
  "Per his LinkedIn page (where his profile photo shows him with his arm around Barack Obama), he graduated with a degree in history from the University of Oregon in 1992, worked for a Burlington-based food pantry from 1994 to 2000, and since 2000 has worked as a senior paralegal at Cambridge & Somerville Legal Services in Massachusetts, where he represents and advocates for applicants and recipients of the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs.",
  "We need to reach out for working-class folks.”\n\nThat kind of attitude has already provoked a backlash from other segments of the Democratic Party, perhaps most notably Hillary Clinton’s current communications director, Nick Merrill, who spoke up in defense of Chelsea Clinton after Levi’s tweet attacking her surfaced:\n\nYes, how dare her use her power to lift up issues like climate change, childhood nutrition, public health concerns, and standing up for Dreamers.",
  "A young (only 38), openly gay Harvard grad and fourth-generation New Hampshirite who works at his family’s restaurant business in Manchester, Pappas has been a sought-after national recruit for years, and goes into the race as a heavy favorite against not only Sanders but the other Democrats in the race, including state Rep. and ex-state AFL-CIO president Mark MacKenzie, state Rep. Mindi Messmer, and Rochester City Attorney and Iraq vet Terence O’Rourke.",
  "@SenSanders has released the following statement about his son entering the #NH01 race pic.twitter.com/0IyweA27iZ — Dom Proto (@Dom_Proto) February 27, 2018\n\nBut even if he doesn’t win, an especially contentious primary in a swing district could have implications for the Democratic effort to retake the House, and for the ongoing national battle over what role the Bernie wing of the Democratic Party will have going forward.",
  "Tuition-free college, Medicare-for-all, a higher minimum wage, equal pay for equal work — these are all populist economic policy staples of Bernie Sanders’s campaigns, and with the possible exception of the last one, they all steer clear from “identity politics” questions around immigration, racial justice, mass incarceration, and the like that Levi Sanders has argued on Twitter are distractions.",
  "Claremont, the small city on the state’s western border with Vermont where he resides, is in the Second District, which also includes the state capital, Concord, and the second-largest city, Nashua; he’s running for the First District, which covers New Hampshire’s largest city, Manchester, as well as the state’s Atlantic Ocean coast and the tourist-heavy Lakes Region.",
  "He was a friend, not an authoritarian.”\n\nThe younger Sanders’s platform, as laid out in his statement announcing his candidacy, mirrors that of his father:\n\nThe majority of voters in New Hampshire, and around this country, agree that we need a Medicare For All healthcare system which guarantees healthcare to every man, women, and child without out of pocket expenses.",
  "The younger Sanders remains a long shot for election; his father has not endorsed him, though his statement on the campaign can also be read as a warning that national Democrats should not try to sink Levi’s bid (with the proviso, “The decision as to who to vote for will be determined by the people of New Hampshire’s first district, and nobody else”):\n\n.",
  "While private attorneys will happily represent disability insurance applicants in exchange for a share of their initial benefits, recipients already on the program faced with benefit reductions or loss of benefits often lack legal representation, and legal aid groups like the one Levi works for play an essential role in filling that gap.",
  "Explaining his past statements, Levi Sanders told the Washington Post’s David Weigel he “sent out a lot of tweets,” and urged voters to look at his broader message:\n\nThe bottom line, as you know, is that different people have different opinions, and when you send out a lot of tweets, people are going to have a lot of opinions about them.",
  "Then again, the state House is enormous (it has 400 members, making it the fourth-largest English-speaking legislative body in the world after the US House of Representatives and the UK Houses of Commons and Lords) and its districts are tiny, so those wins might not be too indicative of Democratic success to come.",
  "While the Second District has been in Democratic hands for 10 of the past 12 years, the First District has been ping-ponging back and forth:\n\nFirst, Carol Shea-Porter, in a shocking upset win, defeated two-term incumbent Jeb Bradley in 2006 as part of the national Democratic anti-Bush wave.",
  "Documents leaked by Guccifer 2.0, the same Russian hacker/hacking collective that released internal Democratic National Committee emails from WikiLeaks, showed that some staffers in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wanted her to step aside in 2016 in favor of Pappas.",
  "Not all his supporters did the same, and the overwhelming support that black voters and civil rights institutions, as well as women’s and reproductive rights groups, gave to Hillary Clinton in that primary helped fuel resentment among a segment of Bernie’s most die-hard fans.",
  "Early in his run, in the summer of 2015, Bernie Sanders faced criticism from Black Lives Matter activists for seeming to privilege discussions of class and economic justice ahead of tackling race-specific issues and the particular injustices visited upon Americans of color.",
  "The winner of the primary will face the Republican nominee, likely either state Sen. Andy Sanborn (who brags of his friendship with Rand Paul on his campaign site) or Eddie Edwards, a law enforcement veteran who served as chief of the state Division of Liquor Enforcement.",
  "Pappas is a member of the Executive Council, a peculiar New Hampshire institution consisting of five elected members, each representing a district of one-fifth the state’s population, who can veto pardons, nominations, and contracts approved by the governor.",
  "How many Bernie fans feel that resentment is, of course, a highly contested question, with Bernie fans usually insisting that the trope of the racially “unwoke” Bernie supporter is a media invention meant to discredit Sanders’s political project.",
  "Now Levi Sanders (pronounced LEH-vee, not LEE-vie) is set to offer a populist alternative to the leading Democratic contender, Executive Councilor Chris Pappas, in what is sure to be cast as a smaller-scale echo of the 2016 presidential primary.",
  "On guns, he seems to go a bit further (at least rhetorically) in supporting new regulations than his father, who famously voted against the Brady Bill requiring background checks and for lawsuit immunity for gun companies while in the House.",
  "Because the districts are vastly larger than those for the state House or state Senate, the Executive Council is a prime recruiting ground for higher office; both candidates in the 2016 gubernatorial race served on the council at the time.",
  "Shea-Porter has apparently decided that she’s sick of ping-ponging in and out of the seat, a decision helped along by the fact that national Democrats have never really liked her and recruited Chris Pappas to run for the seat instead.",
  "Running as a member of the Progressive Party (a left-wing Vermont third party formed by Bernie Sanders’s supporters in the 1990s), she faces incumbent Democrat Miro Weinberger and independent candidate Infinite Culcleasure on March 6.",
  "Levi’s tweets criticizing “identity politics,” resenting the invocation of the phrase “white privilege,” and downplaying the importance of nominating a woman as the 2020 Democratic nominee are an awkward fit in a Democratic primary.",
  "The seat, which is being vacated by incumbent Democrat Carol Shea-Porter and is rated as a “toss-up” by most House election observers, was already attracting high-profile candidates, with both parties facing contested primaries.",
  "So questions of electability are sure to arise in the NH-1 Democratic primary, with Levi Sanders making the case that his brand of economic populism can win over Trump voters, and Pappas tacking more to the center.",
  "He spoke of his environmental policies, like his carbon tax plan, in terms of racial justice and pledged some of the proceeds from that tax to poor minority communities that have been hardest hit by pollution.",
  "That wasn’t always successful, as when he dismissed slavery reparations as a “divisive” policy, but he very consciously avoided attacking racial justice movements and sought to enlist them as partners.",
  "Indeed, his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton picked up steam in large part out of a fear of dynastic politics, of a Clinton or Bush returning to the White House once more.",
  "— Levi Sanders (@Celentra) October 10, 2016\n\nMcAuliffe orders Confederate flag off Virginia license plates https://t.co/VVPjpyI7PA via @rtdnews While lawful this hurts peoples rights.",
  "First, Carina Driscoll, Bernie’s stepdaughter from his wife Jane’s first marriage, jumped into the race for Burlington mayor, a position Bernie himself held from 1981 to 1989.",
  "He, in other words, argued that a focus on class politics can coexist with a platform that takes racial injustice (and gender injustice as well) incredibly seriously.",
  "According to a database compiled by Daily Kos, five state House seats have flipped from Republican to Democrat in 2017 and 2018, with none flipping the opposite way.",
  "And he, naturally, pitched Medicare-for-all and tuition-free college as race-neutral policies that will disproportionately benefit black and Latino communities.",
  "Almost as soon as he announced his campaign, though, critics began digging up old tweets of Levi’s that are likely to complicate if not entirely derail his run.",
  "New Hampshire’s First District is the more conservative of the two districts in the state; it narrowly went for Trump even as Clinton won the state as a whole.",
  "He also stuck by his rejection of “identity politics”: “Simply put, if you’re a man or you’re a woman, that shouldn’t be a reason that somebody votes for you.",
  "Bernie needed to attract a diverse national electorate to his presidential bid; Levi needs to win over voters in a very white district of a very white state.",
  "Sanders also served as a senior policy analyst for his father’s presidential campaign, in addition to taking time off for Bernie’s first Senate run in 2006.",
  "We need an educational system which says that whether you are rich or poor, you have the ability to go to a public college and/or university tuition free.",

  "Under the US Constitution, members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, not the specific district.",
  "Finally, in 2016, Shea-Porter defeated Guinta again, in no small part because of some campaign finance issues embroiling Guinta.",

  "We need to demand that we have a minimum wage which allows people to work forty hours a week without being in poverty.",
  "I can tell you, very clearly, that in 2016, there were going to be some real problems with electing Hillary Clinton.",
