  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2018\n\nTrump ordered the documents released Monday with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying:\n\n“The President has directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to provide for the immediate declassification of the following materials: 1. pages 10–12 and 17–34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page; 2. all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation; and 3. all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”\n\nSanders continued, “In addition, President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr.”\n\nThe move is a blow to conservative lawmakers who have long alleged that the documents will reveal widespread abuse of the FISA system by the highest levels of the FBI during the 2016 campaign.",
  "President Donald Trump reversed course on declassifying documents relating to the 2016 FBI and DOJ investigation of his campaign and instead will refer them to the DOJ inspector general in a Friday tweet.",
  "Lawmakers also point to the documents relating to Ohr’s contacts with salacious dossier author Christopher Steele, along with his wife’s connections to Fusion GPS.",
  "Therefore, the Inspector General….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2018\n\n….has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis.",
  "They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe.",
  "I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at).",
  "I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents.",
  "In the end I can always declassify if it proves necessary.",
  "Also, key Allies’ called to ask not to release.",
  "Speed is very important to me – and everyone!"
