  "I'm just going to tell you that if nothing else, if the president of the United States' son says, boy, do I want to get dirt on Hillary Clinton and I can't wait to release it during the summer when it will do the maximum damage, and he knows that the individuals concerned are Russian -- and, by the way, this is not the investigation, this is Donald Trump Jr. admitting to this meeting when, you know, you have 20 indictments, some of which are -- most of which are Russian related, let's just say, without trying to prejudice where this investigation is going to go, it's like -- it's -- you can't say that there is absolutely no there there.",
  "In the campaign itself, while -- and now we know because you can read about it in the Democratic memo -- while there was an FBI investigation of the Trump campaign and of multiple individuals in the Trump campaign, you do not hear a word from the FBI about that very serious investigation about the possibility of Russian collusion with the campaign, but you hear Jim Comey, time and again out there, saying, we are investigating Hillary Clinton, now we're not investigating Hillary Clinton, now we're back to investigating Hillary Clinton.",
  "Is the president -- how hard is he prepared to push the package that we're hearing about, some of which involve guns, some of which doesn't involve guns, and is it realistic to think that he's going to be able to bring, as he claims, Republican leaders who have killed gun legislation and a lot of these issues before, and the NRA along, because there're some issues here like the red flag law, like raising the age that are going to be very tough for the NRA to swallow?",
  "SCOTT: I'm going to do everything I can -- remember, I'm a father, I'm a grandfather -- one of the first things I said when this happened, I called each of my daughters and I said: Unfortunately, in your lifetime, you're going to have to teach your children how to deal with an acting shooter, that's unfortunate we're going to have to do that, we're going to do everything we can, but each one of us is going to have to be prepared.",
  "WALLACE: Well, here you're getting to -- to the bottom line because all -- for all the talk about dueling memos, which I think are confusing a lot of people, and the surveillance of Carter Page, most people want to know one thing, is there hard evidence that Donald Trump and/or his campaign colluded with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election?",
  "She was the -- she was the one charged with -- after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, with -- with fixing the problem of the federal government having 7,000 Air Force personnel, I believe the number was, who should not have had weapons who were not in the database that would have kept them from getting weapons.",
  "I think that we do need to focus on improving our school safety a little bit, on improving our officers, and I also believe that we need to make it harder for people to access guns when they are not mentally stable, when they are young, when they are not in a place where they should be owning a weapon like this.",
  "EDWARDS: Well, we -- we could turn our schools into prisons and it's still not going to keep people who are able to go and get a weapon that they couldn't ordinarily get across a counter and in some other way from turning those weapons into weapons of war in our schools and our shopping malls and our churches.",
  "Raise the age to buy all guns to 21, ban sale of bump stocks, pass a \"red flag law\", that let families or authorities go to court to take guns away from mentally ill or violent people, $450 million to harden schools and putting law enforcement in every school, $50 million for mental health.",
  "EDWARDS: The ARK-15, with a -- with a bump stock, with a magazine clip that, you know, fires in a rapid speed and -- and -- and more ammunition turns that into a much more dangerous --\n\nWALLACE: But, congresswoman, there was -- you know, and I got a stern talking to from Andrew Pollack.",

  "It says that the individual who did this work was acting in a way that was designed to find dirt, not the exact word, but designed to find dirt on Donald Trump, was being paid, so why didn't the FBI, in the FISA, application name Clinton, DNC and Fusion GPS?",
  "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It feels like it because principally the focus, while we've had the -- the traditional debate we've always had about weapons and guns, this debate, as Mr. Pollock so powerfully put it, is focused on keeping our school safe.",
  "It's a great question, Chris, because it has always been policy of the DOJ and the FBI, when you are doing these things, if there is an individual, an American individual, who is not under scrutiny, to refer to them as U.S. person one, U.S. person two.",

  "What we need to do is to make sure that our children are safe by making sure that people who have mental illnesses, who are otherwise prohibited, should not be able to get a weapon and take these weapons of war off the streets.",
  "WALLACE: During your eight years as governor, you have gotten an A-plus rating from the NRA, but in this package, you've broken with them on a few things -- raising the age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, the red flag law -- why?",
  "WALLACE: Governor, if the Florida legislature passes your entire package, if Congress passes everything that President Trump is talking about, what can you say to the young people, the students who are watching you right now?",
  "That's what we need to focus on and we could all come together as Americans instead of other issues and those other issues -- I agree with you there are other issues there, but the main issue right now is fixing the schools.",

  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: That was really just a confirmation of, if you call it the Republican memo or the Nunes memo, it's referred to as a lot of things, but that was nothing but a confirmation.",
  "But what we have to do is that the difference in the -- in mass shootings is that somebody who shows up who has a weapon that's turned into an automatic weapon changes that place, kills more people.",
