  "In any case, it’s impossible to mask the growing divide, one that Merkel herself may signaled days after the 2016 election with a pointed statement promising to work with Trump on the basis of “common values,” including “democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color.”\n\nOne theory about why Trump is willing to knife Merkel is linked to the fact that the German chancellor was one of Obama’s favorite foreign leaders.",
  "“His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies.”\n\nTrump’s language also drew a strong retort from Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and noted that she’d “experienced myself how a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union.”\n\nMerkel and Trump tried to make nice later in the day when they met on the sidelines of the summit.",

  "Trump insisted the pair had a “very, very good relationship” while Merkel said “we are good partners.”\n\nJames Carafano, a foreign policy expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some countries in Eastern and Central Europe resent Germany’s influence on the continent and might take pleasure in Trump’s approach to Berlin.",
  "In May of 2017, after an encounter with Trump, Merkel told a crowd that, “The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over.”\n\nAfter Wednesday’s Trump performance, that realization is probably more crystal clear than ever, said Sudha David-Wilp, a senior transatlantic fellow with the German Marshall Fund.",
  "“So we’re supposed to protect Germany, but they’re getting their energy from Russia.”\n\n“President Trump’s brazen insults and denigration of one of America’s most steadfast allies, Germany, is an embarrassment,” Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Nancy Pelosi of California said in a joint statement.",
  "Trump suggested that the Nord Stream 2 project will mean that Germany is paying “billions and billions of dollars” to Russia, “the country we’re supposed to be protecting you against.”\n\n“Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia, because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia,” he said.",

  "“Berlin is realizing that we have to think about how Germany gets on with its future without the United States as a strong partner for the remainder of the Trump presidency,” said David-Wilp, who is based in Berlin.",
  "We don’t know.”\n\nCarafano argued that Merkel’s real problem is a failure to engage and flatter Trump as have other foreign leaders, such as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Emmanuel Macron.",
  "For one reason or another, the hits keep on coming.”\n\nTheories abound about the reason for Trump’s German fixation — all the more surprising given his own German ancestry — and there may be no single answer.",
  "Trump supporters say the concern is overblown, and that the Republican president is just giving Germany a healthy dose of “tough love” to make it more resilient against threats from countries like Russia.",

  "“People say ‘Why is he making so many enemies in Europe?’ but I say, ‘He might be making a lot of friends in Europe,’” Carafano said, mentioning Poland as one example.",
  "“And there's no guarantee that a post-Trump America will also bounce back to be the partner that Germany once knew.”\n\nMatthew Karnitschnig contributed to this report.",
  "That’s little consolation to Merkel, who has recently struggled to maintain power in the face of an insurgent populist right furious over her immigration policies.",
