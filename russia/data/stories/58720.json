  "The president is exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases monetize their public service and security clearances, making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate, and the fact that people with security clearances are making these baseless charges provides inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.",
  "And it was part of a full package that was presented to the FISA court and it would have been negligent frankly given what the FBI knew about Carter Page, the history that he had, the fact had been a target of Russian recruitment even prior to this, the fact that they went out and interviewed him in March even before Christopher Steele produced any part of the so-called dossier, that they were acting in good faith.",
  "Literally using a warrant process and lying to judges and the bulk of the information judges are fed so that they can spy on an opposition party candidate associate is full of Russian lies, so maybe you'll have a little more time on your hands and go after if -- I may -- these lies that were bought and paid for by Hillary to Russia, all designed to propagandize the American people.",
  "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is one of the most dangerous moments in modern American history when you think about this, Sean, that the intelligence community was weaponized, weaponized to unseat a duly elected president, with the intention of impeaching him if he got elected, or to -- or to skew the election so that Hillary Clinton could win.",
  "Mr. Mueller, do your job tonight, if you care about truth, if you care about justice, if you care about the system of justice in this country being abused at this high level, if you care that somebody actually paid for Russian lies to misinform the American people and that information was spread by some of the highest levels of our government.",
  "This is an extremely disturbing thing to see, both he and James Comey, supposedly impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important areas in intelligence gathering in law enforcement express the kind of extreme bias that they've shown now, which I think reflects quite accurately on what they were doing back in 2016.",
  "And, by the way, in fact, everyone who signed off on this misled FISA court judges and propagated lies in order to knowingly spy on a campaign and rigged a presidential election in their favor and the media took this bait, they were fed by Christopher Steele at the behest of Fusion GPS, and they sent it out to the media.",
  "A FISA application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get a FISA search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, and that's the way we operate.",
  "Rod Rosenstein lied, McCabe lied -- nothing new for him -- and Yates and Comey and the rest of them all lied, and they all signed off on a warrant application based on a document that is so duplicitous even Steele himself in court proceedings and Great Britain conceded that the dossier was not confirmed or verified.",
  "Footnote number eight from the warrant application, which is so cryptic you would have to be telepathic or clairvoyant to be able to figure out that it was funded by Hillary Clinton and came from a foreign national, an ex-spy, who used multiple hearsay Russian sources that some of whom may not even exist.",
  "And to the best of Rod's knowledge, the basis of the 2016 FISA warrant/warrants against the Trump campaign associate, we now know the following: it was unverified, it was uncorroborated as Rot Rosenstein said it must be, it was untrue, it was a document full of Russia lies and they all signed off on it.",
  "HANNITY: How is it possible that -- this is the biggest story of corruption and abuse of power that I can think of in our history and we have basically been a lone voice and everything that we've been reporting on, that you have reported on, Sara, I can't name all the names, there's too many people.",
  "MCCARTHY: -- not supposed to give -- well, yes, the law demands that you provide accurate information to a court, it doesn't require that it'd be verified and corroborated, but their procedures require--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Rod Rosenstein said that if not there are going to be consequences.",
  "And meanwhile, James Comey admitted he knew that dossier was unverified and salacious and let's not forget, fired FBI director actually denied he told a lie to our own Bret Baier that the dossier was, in fact, playing a major role in the FISA application, the hardest warrant to ever get.",
  "I mean, I have no you doubt that the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CBS News and all the other manifestations of the establishment are desperately seeking to prop up the corrupt system which fed them new stories, which took care of them, which made them feel like insiders.",
  "JARRETT: It's a fraud on the court and, in fact, you played the clip of Rosenstein saying that when you sign this, we take it very seriously, we're vouching for the truthfulness, the honesty the authenticity of our documents and yet, we now know --\n\nHANNITY: Did anyone verify it?",
  "Let's just call it what it was, she threw a grenade in there when it comes to this news that she is now saying, the White House is now considering not only revoking the security clearance of the former CIA chief John Brennan, but also that of Comey, Clapper, McCabe and Rice.",
  "And the fact is, starting with the president, we haven't been tough enough, we haven't been direct enough, we haven't been focused enough and I think if we were this whole thing would collapse in a matter of weeks, because it is so sick and the stake would be so great.",
  "The documents were -- the stuff was under congressional--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: And did they not turn the top FBI officials turned on Trump in a way that was unprecedented and used their power against an opposition party candidate to stop him with an insurance policy?",

  "But now because of the blatant abuse of power that took place at the highest levels of your government, the Trump administration rightly tonight is taking important steps and calling for certain Obama era officials to be stripped of their security clearances.",
  "COMEY: My recollection was there was a significant amount of additional material about Page and why there was probable cause to believe he was an agent of a foreign power and the dossier was part of that, but was not all of it or critical part of it.",
  "Let me put it more simply: Obama's DOJ and FBI were spying on the campaign of an opposing party, in a presidential election year, using op research that Hillary Clinton paid for, deep state operatives tried to rig and steal a presidential election.",

  "The American people will see what happened, how this dossier was used beyond what we're seeing now, which was already extraordinary, how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was fooled and the extent of which they abused the power.",
  "MCCARTHY: No, I'm saying for the politics of the election and I think they did it because number one the FISA stuff is classified, and number two they were sure that Hillary was going to win and no one was ever going to be any wiser.",
  "Socialist superstars Bernie Sanders and yes, the new rock star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were in Kansas n Friday pushing their socialist liberal left wing agenda, and actually claiming they are the new normal to your Democratic Party.",

  "In the later applications, they say, well, we did determine that Steele -- hey didn't use his name but he referred to him as source number one -- that Steele may have misled us, but we believe that his information is credible.",
  "I never met a judge in my life that likes to be lied to, where I grew up, where my mom's a prison guard and my dad had worked in family court probation, yes, sir, no, sir, yes, ma'am, no, ma'am, yes your honor, no your honor.",

  "In fact, according to Page, and I interviewed him for an hour on radio today, he actually was debriefed by the CIA and the FBI after many of his visits to Russia, cooperating with them, helping his own government he said.",
  "On the security clearances, I think anybody who abuses their security clearance, whether it's to politicize intelligence or to leak intelligence, if they find out that you did that, you should get your clearance yanked.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: The information that was used in part in the FISA application came from a trusted source, Christopher Steele, someone who was a respected member of British intelligence.",
  "We'll explain all of this, just as we have been reporting the bulk of the FISA warrant we now know for sure was based on the unverified uncorroborated phony bought and paid for Russian lie dossier of Hillary Clinton.",

  "Make no mistake: this phony, dirty Russian dossier wasn't just referenced in the newly released documents on late Saturday night, instead Steele's dossier was in fact the FISA application, all four of them.",
  "She violated the Espionage Act, mishandled classified, top-secret, special access programming information and destroyed such two separate felonies then rigged an investigation, clearly into Donald Trump.",
  "I mean, you know --\n\nHANNITY: So, this is --\n\nJARRETT: I go through all of the people in this book who have been charged for doing exactly what Hillary Clinton did, and yet --\n\nHANNITY: She did worse.",
  "And if I were to fault the president it wouldn't be for going too far, it would be for not methodically and systematically exposing to the American people, starting frankly with the FISA warrant.",
  "First, they would have laughed and then they would have said, get out of my court with this garbage --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: It holds the fact that it was bought and paid for --\n\nJARRETT: Yes.",

  "They purposely withheld that kind of important piece of information, and the FBI were lied on news accounts and lied to judges, including what's called circular reporting from Yahoo News.",
  "And Christopher Steele was ultimately fired as an FBI source for lying and leaking and still in the FISA warrants after his firing, they claimed to FISA judges that Steele was credible.",

  "GINGRICH: Well, Benjamin Franklin said to a woman right outside the constitutional convention, when she said what have you achieved, and he said, a republic, if you can keep it.",
  "JARRETT: Oh, yes, because the volume -- in fact, Comey wrote the sheer volume indicates that she was grossly negligent, but then he had Strzok and Page expunge that statement.",
  "And then you should say this also if that's all true and if Clapper and Brennan and others were engaged in lying to the American people, why would they keep their secrecy?",
  "And fix an investigation like this, that had turned on one presidential candidate like this and abuse the power in such a level, lying to FISA judges to spy on Americans.",
  "And if he didn't do it or if anybody -- I find out who did this illegally, I will sue them and hire the best legal team including Andy on the planet to go after them.",
  "And he is trying to do it in a way that he's deeply, bitterly opposed not just by the slave-owning south but also by a substantial number of Democrats in the north.",

  "May it please the court that these judges now be told that they've been lied to to this extent by our own top officials in our government to steal an election?",

  "It is the biggest single scandal in American history and your media is deaf, blind and dumb and overpaid and lazy, which brings us to Carter Page.",
  "James Clapper, Susan Rice, Michael Hayden, the destroyed Trump media predictably, and basically if Trump breeds, they will go into meltdown mode.",
  "MCCARTHY: -- Obama administration, but they certainly--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: And did they lie to FISA court judges, not once, but four times?",
  "And the basis for pulling a security is credible derogatory information and it's hard to say that there is no credible derogatory information.",

  "The number test is tomorrow morning, President Trump should sign a note completely eliminating the redactions and release the paper.",
