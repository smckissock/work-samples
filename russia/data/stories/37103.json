  "Russia's ambassador to the United States attended Trump's speech, raising eyebrows by sitting in the front row, and the news about Burt's claims of involvement with the Trump campaign is raising further questions about the potential of Russia's influence, reports Politico.",
  "According to congressional lobbying disclosures the firm of Richard Burt, a former administration official for President Ronald Reagan, received $365,000 for work he and a colleague performed for the pipeline, owned by a firm controlled by the Russian government.",
  "Donald Trump's camp is denying a report that a Republican lobbyist was helping to build the GOP nominee's first major foreign policy speech at the same time he was earning hundreds of thousands of dollars promoting a Russian natural-gas pipeline.",
  "And while the Trump campaign denies Burt's involvement, the lobbyist this summer was invited to attend dinners hosted by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's national security committee chairman, to discuss national security and foreign policy.",
  "Trump has referred to Putin as a \"strong leader\" and praised his leadership skills over those of President Barack Obama, and in August, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned when his tie to pro-Russian forces in Ukraine were revealed.",
  "The pipeline would allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to leverage his control over Europe by allowing Russian gas to reach markets in central and western Europe by bypassing Ukraine and Belarus, reports Politico.",

  "At that time, Russian state-owned oil giant Gazprom owned 50 percent of the company, but in August, the firm's European partners pulled out, leaving Gazprom fully in charge.",
  "Burt and other sources said he recommended Trump use a more \"realist,\" approach to world affairs in his April 27 speech, when he called for more cooperation with Russia.",
  "Burt started working for the company, New European Pipeline AG, which is building the Nord Stream II pipeline, in November.",
  "Burt has had connections with Russia for years, dating back to 1989, when former President George H.W.",
  "Burt and another source told Politico that he also wrote white papers for Sessions on those subjects.",
  "But Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman, said in an email the campaign has \"no knowledge of his claims.\"",
