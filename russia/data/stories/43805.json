  "And somehow, and this is the kind of mistake that only a corporation can make, an individual can't make this mistake because somehow it happens at the intersections of the different teams, so you've got the legal department saying, \"Oh crap, we've made this mistake\" and you've got the books team … And anyway, the answer the company came up with was to — and we did this without warning — just electronically go into everybody's Kindle who had downloaded that book and just disappear it.",
  "Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, recently sat down with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to talk about the early days of creating Amazon, what he's learned since then, how he funds his rocket company, Blue Origin, and what it's like when the president of the United States is your biggest critic.",
  "To the degree that we have regulation, we want to be sure that it is incenting innovation and not blocking it, while at the same time, regarding data security, privacy, encryption — how do you safeguard people's physical safety against terrorists and bad actors all over the world, and how do you balance that against privacy?",
  "This is super important to me, and I believe on the longest timeframe — and really here I'm thinking of a timeframe of a couple of hundred years, so over millions of decades — I believe and I get increasing conviction with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work that I'm doing.",
  "You would dial up the phone and put it in the cradle, and so we had some time-sharing on that mainframe computer, and none of the teachers knew how to use it, so me and two other kids stayed after school and sort of figured out how to do it, and kind of taught ourselves programming from books.",
  "Bezos: For me, again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect, whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency around the world, Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized.",
  "When we first did customer reviews 20 years ago, some book publishers were not happy about it because some of them were negative so it was a very controversial practice at that time, but we thought it was right and so we stuck to our guns and had a deep keel on that and didn't change.",
  "And the debate about the Big 4 or the Big 5 is heating up: Professors like Scott Galloway and The Economist are suggesting a split-up, other powerful people like George Soros are giving very critical speeches at Davos, and the EU Commission is taking pretty tough positions here.",
  "People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon, because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors, or for varied other reasons, including the fact that he doesn't like The Post.",
  "Bezos: Well, first of all, MacKenzie, you know, she had married this stable guy working on Wall Street, and a year after we got married, I went to her and said I wanted to quit my job, move across the country, and start this internet bookstore.",
  "Döpfner: The whole attitude toward data protection and privacy has always been different between Europe and the United States, but it is also at the moment — in the context of events like Cambridge Analytica — changing in the United States.",
  "Döpfner: So you are advocating a balance of, say, entrepreneurs who are really moving their businesses forward, politicians and regulators who are defining a certain framework, society and journalists who are asking unpleasant questions?",
  "Döpfner: Last week we had Bill Gates for dinner here and he said in a self-ironic manner that he has a ridiculous amount of money and it is so hard to find appropriate ways to spend that money reasonably and to do good with the money.",
  "And so again, I think, you know, MacKenzie is an example of this, what I was talking about with my mom and my dad, who's a Cuban immigrant, and he came to the US when he was 16 in a refugee camp in the Everglades.",
  "Now if you take baseline energy usage globally across the whole world and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells.",
  "Bezos: Well, first of all, with any criticism ... my approach to criticism and what I teach and preach inside Amazon — is when you're criticized, first look in a mirror and decide, are your critics right?",
  "And I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true that big government institutions should be scrutinized, big nonprofit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized.",
  "And this was — I was probably 10 years old — so this was around 1974, and we was in a period of time where there were heavy anti-smoking radio advertisements trying to convince people to stop smoking.",
  "And if we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited, for all practical purposes, resources and solar power unlimited for all practical purposes.",
  "And of course as you get into the business world and anything you do on a team, you very quickly realize that it's not just about your own resourcefulness and that it's about team resourcefulness.",
  "But early on with the Kindle, either the first year of the Kindle or the second year of the Kindle, we had accidentally illegally sold —or given away I guess — copies of the famous novel \"1984.\"",
  "Because it had a complicated copyright history, it was in copyright in the US and not in the UK, or something strange like this, so it was in the public domain, but only in certain geographies.",
  "This civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space.",
  "I sometimes see companies - even young, small startup companies or entrepreneurs who arrived — is that they start to pay more attention to their competition than they do to their customers.",
  "Amazon founder and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos announces plans to build a rocket-manufacturing plant and launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, September 15, 2015.",
  "And so when you are doing something in a new way, and if customers embrace the new way, what's going to happen is incumbents who are practicing the older way are not going to like you.",
  "In my 10-year-old mind, I had been extremely clever to do this, and so when I was finished with my arithmetic, I proudly announced to her how many years she had taken off of her life.",
  "And again, I'm not just talking about business things — it's, like, \"I love that person and I never told them,\" and, you know, 50 years later you're, like, \"Why didn't I tell her?",
  "He so loved The Post that he believed, even if this was a huge personal sacrifice for him, because it had been in his family for so long, that he needed to find a new home for it.",
  "But we're also finding out that these powerful tools enable some very bad things, too, like letting authoritarian governments interfere in free democratic elections in the world.",
  "Bezos: We are going to be … so the first tourism vehicle — we won't be selling tickets yet — but we may put humans in it at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.",
  "I got very lucky: My elementary school had a teletype that was connected to a mainframe computer that some business in downtown Houston donated a little bit of computer time to.",
  "I think, first of all, we have a duty on behalf of society to try and help educate any regulators, to give them our point of view sincerely, without any cynicism or skepticism.",
  "Döpfner: Data security and privacy are going to be competitive advantages for companies or a disadvantage for those who are not dealing respectfully and responsibly with data.",
  "I remember, early on, we only had 125 employees, when Barnes & Noble, the big United States bookseller, opened their online website to compete against us, barnesandnoble.com.",
  "I have been — I've won that lottery, of having so many people in my life who have given me that unconditional love, and I do think that MacKenzie's definitely one of those.",
  "Going way back, we just sold books, and then we started selling music and DVDs and electronics and toys and so on, and then we extended into electronic reading with Kindle.",
  "And so maybe in a mature industry where growth rates are slow and change is very slow, but, as you see in the world more and more, there aren't that many mature industries.",
  "Summit\n\nDöpfner: For me, the most moving image that we saw tonight was the one that John Elkann showed, where you and MacKenzie are constructing that famous office table.",
  "We had 125 employees and $60 million a year in annual sales — $60 million with an \"M.\" And Barnes & Noble at that time had 30,000 employees and about $3 billion in sales.",
  "So we don't believe that we need a union to be an intermediary between us and our employees but, of course, at the end of the day, it's always the employees' choice.",
  "My grandfather went to bat for her, and then they tried to kick her out of school, and they're incredible, so the gift I had was I that had this incredible family.",
  "Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author, who was MacKenzie's teacher at Princeton, said on the \"Charlie Rose\" show that MacKenzie was her best student ever.",
  "And that has really impacted my thinking on this issue, because what I'm seeing is — I'm in favor of all — long-term-oriented philanthropy is also very good idea.",
  "You never want to be that guy — and we all have a coworker who's that person — who as soon as they come into a meeting they drain all the energy out of the room.",
  "But if you extrapolate in developed countries where we use a lot of energy, on average in developed countries our civilizational metabolic rate is 11 000 watts.",
  "I think we humans, especially in the Western world, and especially inside democracies, are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind.",
  "And so if entrepreneurs and inventors follow their curiosity and they follow their passions, and they figure something out and they figure out how to make it.",
  "Döpfner: When we were sitting in the first row just a couple of minutes ago, waiting for the award ceremony, you looked at me: \"Mathias, are you nervous?\"",
  "Döpfner: When you bought The Post there were people saying, \"Well, that's just a personal toy — he wants to have some political influence in Washington.\"",
  "When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks.",
  "You know, as the owner of The Post, I know that at times The Post is going to write stories that are going to make very powerful people very unhappy.",
  "It would be like me getting on the airplane and going up to the front of the plane and saying to the pilot, \"You should move aside — let me do this!\"",
  "I am very lucky that I feel like I have a mission-driven purpose with Blue Origin that is, I think, incredibly important for civilization long term.",
  "The fact that I can look up almost anything on Wikipedia in five seconds is an unbelievable capability that just simply didn't exist 20 years ago.",
  "Bezos: He was super important for me, and I spent an unusual amount of time with my grandparents, and especially with my grandfather on the ranch.",
  "One thing that I tell people is if you're going be, if you're going to do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood.",
  "By the way, I believe that in that timeframe we will move all heavy industry off of Earth and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry.",
  "So, and I said, \"Look, you know, it's OK to be afraid, but don't be afraid of our competitors, because they're never going to send us any money.",
  "That story — the slightly longer version of that story, because this is really powerful wisdom — is that I made my grandmother burst into tears.",
  "So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself in a private moment that story of your life.",
  "I'm pursuing this work, because I believe if we don't we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing.",
  "Bezos: I think it helps you take … By the way I think that's probably true for all kinds of risks in life, not just for starting a business.",
  "And I think that, when you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they're almost always the things that you did not do.",
  "So, we moved, and then MacKenzie, who basically has no skill in this area at all — I mean, really, you're the least suited person for this.",
  "The reason customers have been receptive in large part to our new initiatives is because we have worked hard to earn their trust with them.",
  "[Laughs] And we fixed windmills, and laid water pipelines, and built fences, and barns, and fixed the bulldozer that you guys talked about.",
  "One of the advertisements had this figure in it that said something like, \"Every puff of a cigarette takes so many minutes off your life.\"",
  "At the same time, you are aggressively criticized by unions, and by the media for paying low wages, for inappropriate working conditions.",
  "[Laughs] So, it'd be as if we'd walked into your bedroom in the middle of the night, found your bookshelf, and just took that book away.",
  "Döpfner: So, is it a union fight, because the union wants to make sure you are unionized, or what is the real substance of the conflict?",
  "At about 1 or 2 in the morning, I said to one of my software-engineering colleagues — I said, \"You know, Paul, this is killing my knees.",
  "Do you think that there is a change in the mindset of society, and how should the big tech companies, how should Amazon deal with that?",
  "You know, we see it in the automobile industry with self-driving cars, but you can go right down the line of every industry and see it.",
  "I think you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company — one of these big tech companies, or any other big institution.",
  "What you have to worry about and the problem I would not want to see happen is that you don't want to block innovation and invention.",
  "So when he approached me with this I said, \"You know, I'm the wrong guy, because I don't know anything about the newspaper business.\"",
  "I was one of those people who every time I looked at something it looks like it could be improved — there's something wrong with it.",
  "Döpfner: So you think that unconditional love — if you feel and experience unconditional love — it helps you to take risks in life?",
  "And at that time all of the headlines — and the funniest were about how we were about to be destroyed by this much larger company.",
  "There were 3 million in 1994 when I was pulling this idea together — 3 million different books active in print at any given time.",
  "I think there were certain purchasers he was hoping would not end up buying The Post, because he wanted it to remain independent.",
  "I think with customers one of the reasons we have been able to extend into new business areas and pursue new product categories.",
  "Bezos: The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.",
  "And that's, by the way, why the work at The Washington Post and all other great newspapers around the world do is so important.",
  "And as John mentioned the story about the words my grandfather gave me at one point that \"It's harder to be kind than clever.\"",
  "And I think that in big mature industries, that can or might be a winning approach that some cases they kind of close follow.",
  "And I have my mother to thank for that because she worked hard to make sure as we grew up so that we stayed close together.",
  "My mom had me when she was 17 years old, and she was still in high school, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and this is in 1964.",
  "Döpfner: With regard to your personal lifestyle, there are no guilty pleasures, unreasonable things that you do with money?",
  "So what does money mean for you, being the first person in history who has a net worth of a three-digit amount of billions.",
  "It was very obvious to me as soon as I thought about it that way, it was like OK, I think I actually can help in two ways.",
  "And so one of the things that's so interesting about that lifestyle and about my grandfather is he did everything himself.",
  "And one of the most powerful ones is who your early role models are, you know it could be ...\n\nDöpfner: Your grandfather.",
  "She takes all the grandkids for one week every summer so that me and my sister and our spouses can go on a trip together.",
  "Evan Agostini/AP Images\n\nDöpfner: Did she, being an author, suggest that you focus on the book business at the beginning?",
  "So we've always been growing very fast in percentage terms, but in 2010, just eight years ago, we had 30,000 employees.",
  "Döpfner: Really, so you'd say retail, e-commerce, clouds, publishing — that's all less relevant than the space project?",
  "By the way, before we really get into this: How about this amazing production that you and your team have put together?",
  "And if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they need and are going to be inspected.",
  "The next day I bought packing tables, and it doubled our productivity, and probably saved our backs and our knees too.",
  "Because she wanted to support it and she knew that I had always had this passion for invention and starting a company.",
  "I can assure you that being a pregnant teenager in high school was not cool in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at that time.",
  "And if we just stay focused on them, instead of obsessing over this big competitor that we just got, we'll be fine.\"",
  "And any of you who are lucky enough to know Don know that he is the most honorable gentleman that you'll ever meet.",
  "So, I sat in the back of the car on this long car ride and calculated how many years she had taken off of her life.",
  "I loved that movie, and also reading Katherine Graham's memoir, which won a Pulitzer Prize and is an amazing book.",
  "And if you think of it even more broadly, it's tech and machine learning, big data, and all these kinds of things.",
  "Jeff, you are one of the most long-term-thinking entrepreneurs when it comes to companies, products, and services.",
  "This work-life harmony thing is what I try to teach young employees and actually senior executives at Amazon too.",
  "And he said, \"That's OK, because we have a lot of people at The Post who know a lot about the newspaper business.",
  "We got in a room, and because it was so scary for all of us, this idea that now we finally had a big competitor.",
  "But there's a second kind of critic, which is the self-interested critic, and they come in all shapes and sizes.",
  "On the issue of working conditions, I'm very proud of our working conditions and very proud of the wages we pay.",
  "I mean, I have lots of pleasures, and we just came back from an amazing trip with the kids, MacKenzie and I did.",
  "You know, in Germany we employ 16,000 people, and we pay at the high end of the range for any comparable work.",
  "I think that if you stay focused and the more drama there is and everything else, no matter what the drama is.",
  "And MacKenzie, of course, like everybody I explained this to, her first question was: \"What's the internet?\"",
  "It would be one of those things when I'm 80 years old I would be so unhappy with myself if I had interfered.",
  "Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple: They used to be seen as the nice guys in T-shirts who are saving the world.",
  "Which is, you know, a woman with kids, the father runs away and he was the only person providing any income.",
  "In our view, we have workers' councils, of course, and we have very good communications with our employees.",
  "Döpfner: What's the lesson that you learned from that, and could you imagine also to buy other newspapers?",
  "And so you do need, as you're looking at yourself in the mirror, to try and tease those two things apart.",
  "We started doing in Seattle, there is a homeless shelter called Mary's Place, run by a woman named Marty.",
  "We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me this is the best one.",
  "For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year, our energy usage as a civilization.",
  "Bezos: Well, I knew that the books, strangely — I was very prepared for this to take a really long time.",
  "We're skeptical always of our government in the United States, state governments, and local governments.",
  "Bezos in a meeting with prominent tech leaders and President Trump after the 2016 presidential election.",
  "Evan Vucci/AP\n\nDöpfner: The general sentiment concerning the big innovative tech companies has changed.",
  "It's healthy, because they're big, powerful institutions — the police, the military, or whatever it is.",
  "If you cannot afford to be misunderstood, then for goodness' sake, don't do anything new or innovative.",
  "In my view, you need to harness that energy primarily on your customers instead of on your competitors.",
  "I have been passionate about certain things forever, and I fell in love with computers in fourth grade.",
  "Could you share with us the vision of Blue Origin and the idea of space tourism with reusable rockets?",
  "Whatever the actionable distraction is, your response to it should be to double down on the customer.",
  "There are well-meaning critics who are worried it's not going to work, but they do want it to work.",
  "Because I think it's one of those things, you know, you kind of know that somebody's got your back.",
  "Very rarely are you going to regret something that you did that failed and didn't work or whatever.",
  "But it's not ultimately our decision, so we will work with any set of regulations that we're given.",
  "You can really help that person, and by the way, you only have to help them for six to nine months.",
  "It illustrates, symbolically, that the launch of Amazon was really something that you did together.",
  "Döpfner: But do you have any idea of where your ambition really comes from — what was driving you?",
  "Anyway, he created the illusion for me when I was 4 years old that I was helping him on the ranch.",
  "You know, he didn't call a vet if one of the animals was sick; he figured out what to do himself.",
  "Is this break-up scenario something that you take seriously, or do you think it's just a fantasy?",
  "One of the unintended consequences often of regulation is that it really favors the incumbents.",
  "By the way, we've always been working on energy efficiency, and still we grow our energy usage.",
  "I don't want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in a civilization of stasis.",
  "[Laughs]\n\nAnd so I called an all-hands meeting, which was not hard to do with just 125 people.",
  "I picked books because there were more items in the book category than in any other category.",
  "How did you dare to think that you should become an entrepreneur and really launch a company?",
  "The sit-down interview happened in Berlin, where Bezos received the Axel Springer Award 2018.",
  "It is very moving because it shows how you really started from scratch, like two classmates.",
  "Every book ever printed, even the out-of-print ones was the original vision for the company.",
  "They are often the ones doing that initial scrutiny, even before the government agencies do.",
  "Döpfner: But your most prominent critic at the moment is the president of the United States.",
  "And one thing to note about is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently.",
  "So when the opportunity came up, because I had known Don Graham at that point for 15 years.",
  "And my view is, that's a debilitating phrase because it implies there's a strict trade-off.",
  "It's the most important newspaper in the most important capital city in the Western world.",
  "One of the early, most painful ones is so stupid, it's hard to believe how we ever did it.",
  "Döpfner: Are you upset if the Post journalists are writing critical stories about Amazon?",
  "But I wouldn't be because I think for society, you really want to see continued progress.",
  "And the reality is, if I am happy at home, I come into the office with tremendous energy.",
  "And I had no idea what was about to happen, because he had never said a cross word to me.",
  "And so we haven't learned as a civilization and a human species how to operate that yet.",
  "It doesn't mean you don't trust them, or that they're bad or evil or anything like that.",
  "And then, second, I had to decide, \"Did I want to put my own time and energy into this?\"",
  "That, for me — I just had to ask the simple question: \"Is it an important institution?\"",
  "He took me out so that we had some privacy from her and he said these incredible words.",
  "You can picture these teletypes: They had the punch tape and they had a 300-baud modem.",
  "He's not taking risks himself — he is taking advantage of risks that other people take.",
  "Look, we all get gifts, we get certain things in our life that we're very lucky about.",
  "He said, \"You're going to figure out one day that it's harder to be kind than clever.\"",
  "And in my view the internet is quite old at this point; we've been around a long time.",
  "Seeing a lot of the homelessness that Mary's Place works on is transient homelessness.",
  "Döpfner: Well, you are not flying airplanes, but you are sending rockets to the orbit.",
  "If it is about philanthropy, you recently said that you are a very short-term thinker.",
  "That's the world that I want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in.",
  "It's just that they have a lot of power and control, and so you want to inspect them.",
  "But for sure we would be very naïve to believe that we're not going to be criticized.",
  "I haven't had any existential crises — knock on wood — I don't want to jinx anything.",
  "So it could be — I can give you an example — customer reviews would be one of those.",
  "The way I did it was we were driving on a long road trip, and she was a chainsmoker.",
  "He had a ranch in South Texas, and I would spend my summers there, from age 4 to 16.",
  "When I was 4, they were taking me for the summer to kind of give my parents a break.",
  "Bezos: You can explain things to people, but you can't understand things to people.",
  "You know, in my mind, I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself.",
  "And so I could see how you could make a bookstore online with universal selection.",
  "First of all, of course, I'm interested in space, because I'm passionate about it.",
  "Well, you can have a life of stasis, where you cap how much energy we get to use.",
  "So in the last eight years we've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees.",
  "Now, Amazon at this point is an incumbent, so maybe I should be happy about that.",
  "I think the great thing about humans in general is we're always improving things.",
  "I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift.",
  "And we had limited resources, and the headlines were very negative about Amazon.",
  "It's usually the moms calling and asking their children are you going to be OK?",
  "Döpfner: Maggie Thatcher said, \"Leadership is not to be pleased by the moment.\"",
  "I knew that the books business was going to be successful in the first 30 days.",
  "So, everybody, including me and the software engineers were all packing boxes.",
  "And Paul looked at me and he was, like, \"Jeff, we need to get packing tables.\"",
  "We will follow those rules regardless of the impact they have on our business.",
  "They let other people be the pioneers and, you know, go down the blind alleys.",
  "I am liquidating about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock to fund Blue Origin.",
  "And I am going to use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that.",
  "When you go study homelessness, there are a bunch of causes of homelessness.",
  "They would probably, depending on the moment, they might criticize my laugh.",
  "You can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away.",
  "What we really need is somebody who knows something more about the internet.",
  "We were down on our hands and knees on a concrete floor, packing the boxes.",
  "If you take your body, your metabolic rate as a human, it's just an animal.",
  "We went to a wolf preserve and actually got to interact with timber wolves.",
  "If we were to talk to your kids, what would they criticize about their dad.",
  "But there is another bucket of homelessness is this transient homelessness.",
  "So, an investment banker is actually the exact opposite of an entrepreneur.",
  "There are many things that a new, inventive company tries that won't work.",
  "Döpfner: So, the lesson was, if it really matters, there is no delegation?",
  "Because you're right, you're not going to spend it on a second dinner out.",
  "It has nothing to do with … I don't even get so far… I just don't want to.",
  "So obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore.",
  "That literally everybody's parents were calling and saying, \"Are you OK?\"",
  "I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a 5-year-old boy.",
  "Döpfner: Jeff, when can I buy the first ticket to do a little space tour?",
  "And by the time I was 16, of course, I was actually helping on the ranch.",
  "Döpfner: The most recent thing you are planning seems to be home robots.",
  "So, in a natural state, where we're animals, we're only using 100 watts.",
  "You want to come into the office and give everyone a kick in their step.",
  "The largest physical bookstores only had about 150,000 different titles.",
  "And if you mistreat their data, they will know, they will figure it out.",
  "So MacKenzie is a very talented novelist, but she is not an accountant.",
  "And so if you're thinking about it logically, it's an emotional thing.",
  "Döpfner: And when did you know that Amazon was going to be successful?",
  "Bezos: I wanted it in a time zone either in Canada, the US, or Mexico.",
  "Döpfner: Could you describe a little bit the role of your grandfather?",
  "Other people thought it was a new long-term element of your strategy.",
  "Ted S. Warren/AP Images\n\nDöpfner: Amazon is employing 566,000 people.",
  "And so we were rightly criticized for that, and we responded to that.",
  "Bezos: My view on Amazon's role in this, which is what you asked me.",
  "The head of our technology team, a guy named Shailesh, is fantastic.",
  "And I got a reaction I did not expect, with her bursting into tears.",
  "I am always quoting Churchill or something and am getting it wrong.",
  "And we went to Norway for three days and we stayed in an ice hotel.",
  "And they're, like, \"That's not even close to what Churchill said!\"",
  "It really was an incredible vacation, a pretty incredible holiday.",
  "Bezos: I saw that rumor in the press, and I can't comment on that.",
  "We have been getting better at using it with every passing decade.",
  "I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined.",
  "The Post was in a very difficult financial position at that time.",
  "I'm going to be very happy when I'm 80 that I made that decision.",
  "[Laughs] And I was, like, \"Oh, my God, that is such a good idea.\"",
  "I could fix prolapsed cattle; we did all our own veterinary work.",
  "So my grandfather stopped the car and he took me out of the car.",
  "These boxes that you were filming live - that's just crazy cool.",
  "Bezos: I think I always wanted to do it, even since I was a kid.",
  "I can provide financial resources while this turn around occurs.",
  "If you go astray on this, you might start to take it personally.",
  "I think of the internet like this big, new, powerful technology.",
