  "LAURA JARRETT, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, Attorney\n\n\n\nGeneral Sessions is trying to offer something of a delicate compromise here, stopping well short of the formal appointment of a special counsel that his party as you said has demanded for months, but tapping a career federal prosecutor with essentially all of the same powers to investigate a range of Republican claims that the FBI engaged in misconduct when it came to investigating Hillary Clinton and wrongfully they say obtained a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.",
  "STELTER: Despite having very high ratings, it's a unique in that sense on the Fox schedule, we'll see if this has an impact on Ingraham after today or tomorrow, but I thought the speed of her apology tells you all you need to know, that she was taking perhaps the advertiser messages seriously and the conspiracy minded thinking, you know, it's a live book on the right and the left right now, but especially on the right, and it sustain.",
  "And as I said before, I think Sacramento can actually teach the nation something, because if in fact Mayor Steinberg and police Chief Hahn can come together with Black Lives Matter, so you know what, we're taking this in a zone we never have before in this nation, we're going to take a stand when it comes to making sure its accountability of policeman visa (ph) the most vulnerable of our citizens.",
  "COOPER: Congresswoman, it also fights back against what people at the White House have been saying, the president's supporters have been saying, pundits on TV have been saying, that all of that alleged crime that Manafort and Gates were being accused of by Mueller had happened a long time before the campaign, before any involvement with Donald Trump, according to this latest reporting.",
  "If we black people have been hyped up about how wonderful or the potential of slave holders or Jim Crow heads or Jane Crow heads and then zero in on what we can do, how we can come together, bring together people of all races genders, concerned about justice concern, about these young black men and women getting killed or any folk who get killed an innocent man.",
  "He wasn't exactly close inside the inner circle of Donald Trump, but according to people we've talked to, he very much liked to keep tabs on the comings and goings, he was definitely still associated with the campaign at the time of that Trump tower meeting -- the meeting where Paul Manafort was meeting with Russians, allegedly, to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Well, CNN has learned that the president was impressed with his performance and how Dr. Jackson handled himself on camera factored into getting on the job, which, keeping them honest, involves managing a department of 370,000 employees, providing health care and other benefits to millions of veterans.",
  "And so, the question here now though is, you know, obviously, they told one thing, the prosecutors told one thing to Rick Gates during these negotiations, but we'll see whether, when this trial against Paul Manafort, he is facing criminal charges and could go on trial this summer, whether Rick Gates is needed in that trial.",
  "And so, this is a big deal, simply because despite what you hear from the president, despite what you hear from the White House, it appears Robert Mueller has not given up on the question of collusion, the question of collusion is very much what he wants Rick Gates to perhaps help his prosecutors come up with a case on.",
  "We got to turn our heart break and heart ache in the certain powerful full of all that love and justice and ought to be flowing out of souls building on the legacy to done cold chains and the (INAUDIBLE) and Martin Luther King Jr., let us never forget the rich legacy, that love train that constitute the black freedom.",
  "So, I mean, it's really fascinating, Jeff, that this whole time people were assuming Rick Gates role was essentially he pled guilty -- you know, he made a plea deal in order to -- he was turn, in order to get the person above him, who was Paul Manafort, but this is a whole other kind of aspect to it.",
  "Last year, you may remember Budget Director Mick Mulvaney stood in the White House briefing room and showed reporters photographs of construction at two locations, as he said, prove that stuff, as he called it, was going up because President Obama was fulfilling his promise to build a wall.",
  "In a certain respect, you can say Sessions appears to have answered that call with a solution that uses someone outside of Washington but stopped short of a Mueller-like appointment that has only been used twice in history and was supposed to be reserved for extraordinary circumstances.",
  "COOPER: Well -- I mean that's the thing, I mean on the one hand, they've entered an the adult fray of, you know, you can agree or disagree with their cause, but they have entered the adult arena of politics and yet the same time, you know, they're still going to school.",
  "COOPER: This happened to Hannity before when he was pedaling false conspiracy theories object Seth Rich and his connection to the DNC and why he may have been murdered, which policy say was basically a botched robbery, in their opinion notes unsolved at this point.",
  "So, again, what we hear from the president, what we are hearing now from people who were close to these discussions with Rick Gates, appears to show a different picture that very much paints a picture that Robert Mueller is not done with the question of collusion.",
  "So, a proffer session obviously occurred and my bet is that in that proffer session, Gates revealed, Russian connections, because the Manafort indictment indicates that the road to Russia leads through the Ukraine, where Manafort had a lot of connections.",
  "One of the teenagers who survived the shooting massacre at his high school, David Hogg did not get into some of the colleges he applied to, you might ask why we even bringing this up, because a Fox News personality decided to mock him for it.",
  "We saw this morning just about two miles in that direction to the west on this dirt road, we saw the border patrol looking inside this canal, and they found the body of a man who could not survive the current trying to get into this country.",
  "As you know, the president, Republican lawmakers and especially right wing talk show hosts have been pushing for Sessions to name a special counsel to look into what they call the real election scandal misconduct they say by the FBI.",
  "Because, well, what I would say is what strikes me and struck me from the beginning was the thing we discovered in Watergate, when we listened to the tapes, was that Richard Nixon was orchestrating the cover-up from the get-go.",
  "And the man now at the center of the partisan struggle is John Huber, a federal prosecutor who received bipartisan report in the past, in the past, serving under both President Trump and Obama as the U.S. attorney in Utah.",

  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: So Mulvaney's claim was wrong, the fence he claimed was part of a promise to build a new boarder wall was actually repaired to a wall that was built during the George W. Bush administration.",
  "PEREZ: Well, we're beginning to see a little bit of that, because earlier this week, there was a filing in a separate case involving a lawyer who had done -- whose law firm had done some work for the Manafort company.",
  "COOPER: But can somebody without management experience, whether it's Dr. Jackson or somebody else, someone without managing a large organization, as you say, hundreds of thousands of employees, can they do this job?",
  "Do you see progress being made when it comes to relationship between the African-American community and police forces in communities around the country or do you think we're still in the same place that we were?",
