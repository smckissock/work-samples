  "| Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Trump tweets of reported Fusion GPS payment\n\nPresident Donald Trump directed his followers’ attention Monday morning to reporting that he incorrectly claims shows former President Barack Obama’s campaign organization paid nearly $1 million to the private investigation firm behind a dossier of salacious but unverified information alleging ties between Trump and the Russian government.",
  "The president’s finger-pointing comes as the first indictments were issued as part of the investigation led by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who has been charged by the Justice Department with leading an independent probe into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and allegations that the Trump campaign or individuals with ties to Trump colluded with those efforts.",
  "The Washington Post reported last week that both the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign paid millions to Perkins Coie, which in turn paid Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unconfirmed dossier alleging collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.",
  "The Federalist report, which is based on publicly available Federal Election Commission reports, shows only that Obama for America funds went to Perkins Coie, classified as “legal services,” not that that money was then funneled to Fusion GPS.",
  "The Federalist’s story has gained significant traction within conservative circles, but Trump’s summary of its reporting offers a conclusion not reached in the story: that Obama’s campaign organization had funded the dossier.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nThe president’s online post does not link to a specific story but appears to be a reference to The Federalist’s report that Obama for America paid $972,772 to Perkins Coie, an international law firm.",
  "The dossier in question, which was published last winter by BuzzFeed just days before Trump’s inauguration, alleged significant collusion between the Kremlin and the president’s campaign and remains unverified.",
  "Nobody knows who OK'd!” Trump wrote on Twitter Monday, offering a somewhat incorrect account of reporting published a day earlier by The Federalist.",
  "President Donald Trump has denied all of the allegations in the dossier.",
  "“Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS.",
  "Trump has denied all of the allegations in the dossier.",
  "The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?)",
  "from DNC."
