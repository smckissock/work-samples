  "CBS News\n\nTo get people to stop and look, he crafted different messages for different people -- so that you only got ads about the issues you cared about most.",
  "The irony, he says, is that it wasn't a foreign entity helping the campaign, but left-leaning American companies like Twitter, Google, and above all Facebook.",
