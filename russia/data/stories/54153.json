  "USA TODAY\n\nThe actress Stephanie Clifford, who uses the stage name Stormy Daniels, arrives to perform at the Solid Gold Fort Lauderdale strip club on March (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty)\n\nTranscript provided by CBS News:\n\nIntro: A week and a half before the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s personal attorney paid a porn star named Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with the Republican candidate for president.",
  "Stephanie Clifford: He said that it was great, he had-- a great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lotta people must underestimate me-- that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening.",
  "It says, in part: “My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more.”\n\nAnderson Cooper: If Stormy Daniels denied the affair in 2011, which you say is a lie, denied the affair in early January 2018, denied the affair in late January of 2018, doesn't that hurt her credibility?",
  "Michael Avenatti: If the President of the United States' fixer made it clear to me, either directly or indirectly, that I needed to sign it, and I was in the position of Stormy Daniels, I might sign those statements\n\n\n\nStephanie Clifford: I felt intimidated and s-- honestly bullied And I didn't know what to do.",
  "(laugh) And I just felt like maybe-- (laugh) it was sort of-- I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone's room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, “well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this.”\n\nAnderson Cooper: And you had sex with him.",
  "He’s a Los Angeles trial lawyer who is suing the president in a California court, seeking to have Stormy Daniels’ non-disclosure agreement – or “NDA” – declared invalid, in part because the president never signed it on the lines provided for his alias -- “D.D.,” David Dennison.",
  "Stephanie Clifford: Because people are just saying whatever they wanted to say about me, I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I'm not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, “Oh, you’re an opportunist.",
  "In March, the Washington Post reported that the “special counsel has examined episodes involving Michael Cohen,” including his efforts to launch a Trump-branded project in Moscow in the fall of 2015 when Mr. Trump was seeking the Republican nomination.",

  "Narration: What makes the dispute between Stormy Daniels and the President more than a high-profile tabloid scandal is that her silence was purchased eleven days before the presidential election, which may run afoul of campaign finance laws.",
  "Narration: Fifteen months after she signed the non-disclosure agreement, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal published this story, quoting anonymous sources, saying that Mr. Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen had paid her for her silence.",
  "Through his spokesman, Mr. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels, and his lawyers are now threatening her with financial ruin, saying she has to pay $1 million dollars every time she violates her agreement to stay silent.",
  "And in that article in Vanity Fair this past week, Michael Cohen said that when he wins damages from Stormy Daniels, “I might even take an extended vacation on her dime.”\n\nAnderson Cooper: You're saying they're tryin' to intimidate her.",
  "Narration: Avenatti points to this recent court filing in which the president’s lawyers claim Daniels is already liable for damages “in excess of twenty million dollars” for unspecified violations of her non-disclosure agreement.",
  "But we did receive a letter from Mr. Trump’s attorney Charles Harder, who asked that we show on camera and read on air one of the statements Stormy Daniels signed in January, denying reports she’d had an affair with Mr. Trump.",
  "Daniels says the agreement was appealing because it meant she would receive some money but also not have to worry about the affect the revelation of the affair would have on her child who was now old enough to watch the news.",
  "And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret.",
  "In return for signing this non-disclosure agreement, Cohen would pay her $130,000 dollars through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established in mid-October 2016 called essential consultants.",
  "And so-- clearly, the Justice Department, the deputy attorney general who is ultimately in charge of this, has determined that looking at what Manafort did in other contexts -- is relevant to the investigation.",
  "\"You're gonna shock a lotta people, you're smart and they won't know what to expect\n\nAnderson Cooper: Did you think he was serious, or did you think he was kind of dangling to get you to wanna be involved him?",

  "Narration: The payment Stormy Daniels received is the subject of complaints by watchdog groups to the department of justice and the federal election commission, which Trevor Potter used to be chairman of.",
  "Anderson Cooper: There are people who argue that this much ado about nothing, that if this was not a story about, an adult film actress and the President of the United States, no one would pay attention.",

  "Cohen told the New York Times last month he used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels and said, “neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign .",
  "I also think that there's no question that when the American people take all of the facts and evidence into consideration, that they are going to conclude that this woman is telling the truth.",
  "What was also required under the non-disclosure agreement was for Stormy Daniels to turn over all “video images, still images, email messages, and text messages” she had regarding Mr. Trump.",

  "Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?",
  "Stephanie Clifford: Because he came and sat next to me and, you know, touched my hair, and put his hand on my leg, and r-- referenced back to how great it was the last time.",
  "Anderson Cooper: So you signed and released-- a statement that said, I am not denying this affair because I was paid in hush money I'm denying it because it never happened.\"",
  "Anderson Cooper: As a prosecutor, you wanna get leverage over somebody that you could then use to get them to give you other information on which--\n\nTrevor Potter: Correct.",
  "Today, that arrangement is well on its way to becoming the most talked-about “hush agreement” in history, with potential legal and political implications for the president.",

  ".” This past week, Cohen told Vanity Fair magazine, “What i did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients.",

  "Stephanie Clifford: Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself\n\nAnderson Cooper: Is part of talking w-- wanting to set the record straight?",
  "This is about the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb.",
  "She was one of the most popular actresses in the adult industry when she was introduced to Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July 2006.",
