  "Thomson Reuters Brookfield Asset Management Inc proposed on Friday to take a 50-60 percent stake in bankrupt solar company SunEdison Inc unit TerraForm Power Inc, a week after it expressed interest in buying the \"yieldco\".",
  "The asset manager also said it was prepared to make an offer for SunEdison's other unitTerraForm Global Inc.\n\nBrookfield said last week it had met with TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global to discuss options for a deal.",
  "Canada's largest alternative-asset manager's latest offer comes after the yieldcos said on Tuesday they had requested bondholders to waive financial statement reporting requirements.",
  "The company's shares have risen 48.7 percent since Brookfield took a stake in the company on June 29, when it expressed interest in buying SunEdison's stake in TerraForm.",
  "One option included Brookfield replacing SunEdison as the sponsor of the yieldcos, keeping them as listed entities and purchasing their class A and class B shares.",
  "If the bondholders agree to the waiver the yieldcos could incur additional costs and covenant restrictions, limiting their ability to raise capital.",

  "The cash offer of $13 for class A and class B shares of TerraForm Power is nearly in line with the class A stock's Thursday close of $13.01.",

  "Brookfield had said it could alternatively purchase the two yieldcos for cash."
