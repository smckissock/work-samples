  "But veterans of the 103-year-old watchdog say that the agency, without more cash, a more cutting-edge staff and stronger legal teeth, increasingly runs the risk of being outmatched by the very tech giants it oversees.",

  "“For a long time the FTC itself has been pointing out the gaps in its authority,” said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner who concluded her four-year tenure last week.",
  "The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn’t always able to fine tech companies for their first privacy or security offenses.",
  "McSweeny pointed recently to the rise of online “disinformation” and “deepfakes” -- videos, in some cases, where politicians are edited to say things they never uttered.",
  "“Will the new FTC have the will to take on today’s challenges aggressively?” asked Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.",
  "They’ll be expected to monitor phenomena such as the fast-growing footprint of companies such as Amazon.com and the security practices of the entire tech industry.",
  "In the United States, the FTC hasn’t brought such a major case since its own probe of Google — an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact.",

  "To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but also other tech companies that mishandle consumers’ data.",
  "Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million -- or about a third of 1 percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017.",
