  "At the end of the post, he did admit fault, though in a fairly general sense rather than specifically, stating “I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform.” Admitting fault is vital if you want your statement to be taken seriously, and it’s important to outline what you will do to prevent the problem from happening again.",
  "It’s hard to say if better marketing and PR moves could have prevented the severity of this media-blasted nightmare for Facebook, but you can certainly use this information to improve your own brand’s image—regardless of whether you have any scandals in your future.",

  "Zuckerberg did a great job of providing details regarding the incident in his blog post, but (perhaps rightfully) spent much of the post discussing how the researcher and Cambridge Analytica were to blame for the incident.",

  "While Zuckerberg did a good job of telling users how Facebook failed them, Zuckerberg did not issue a direct apology in his post, which several users pointed out in the comments section of it.",
  "A major point of this scandal is its secrecy—nobody knew this data was being collected or used—so further attempts to obfuscate the truth, or run from it, only made matters worse for Facebook.",

  "Regardless of how you feel about Facebook, or how you feel about the state of modern online user privacy, this is a classic example of a PR disaster and brand management in action.",
  "By that point, underinformed users were freaking out and deleting the app, and the media was dragging the Facebook brand through the mud, calling for Zuckerberg to speak up.",
  "For others, it’s yet another indication of the tragic state of modern politics, since the ill-gotten data was used as part of President Trump’s 2016 campaign.",
  "How Facebook Responded\n\nWhen the news broke, the media went crazy, and users demanded an answer for what they perceived to be a serious misuse of their data.",
  "Zuckerberg also apologized, and mentioned new updates on the horizon designed to give users more transparency about how their data is collected and used.",
  "Offering a sincere apology, and telling customers how you failed them is a gesture of humility, and is often the first step to restoring trust.",

  "The longer your customers spend thinking about the situation, the more time they’ll have to form opinions about what happened, and why.",
  "What Really Happened\n\nIf it’s hard to find a concise explanation of what happened, there’s a reason—this is a complicated situation.",
  "If you can’t get ahead of a PR scandal or a bit of bad news about your company, you better be sure you act fast in response to it.",
