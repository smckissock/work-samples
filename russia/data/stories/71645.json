  "In late November, President Petro Poroshenko celebrated the formation of a new government following October parliamentary elections with a Tweet that made this point to his 237,700 followers: “The main difference between Ukraine and Russia isn’t only linguistic, it lies in our differing political cultures and attitudes to freedom and democracy.”\n\nIt is an entirely good thing that Ukraine’s new leaders are defining their national identity as inherently democratic and freedom-loving.",
  "Like Russia’s Yeltsin, a former candidate-member of the Politburo, Ukraine’s new leadership was made up overwhelmingly of relics of the Soviet-era leadership: Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine’s first president, had been the ideology secretary of the Communist Party in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic; his successor, Leonid Kuchma, had been the director of a mega-factory in Dnipropetrovsk that built the SS-18 missiles, the 10-warhead behemoth of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces.",
  "Dnipropetrovsk had resisted the little green men—the governor had offered a $10,000 bounty for any captured Russian soldier—and was scornful of the “Soviet” mentality of neighboring Donetsk, which was suffering from a so-called hybrid war (waged by Russian-backed locals armed with Russian equipment and artillery and supported by undercover Russian officers, advisers and soldiers who were, according to the Russian government, “volunteering while on holiday”).",
  "To take just one example: on August 19, 1991, when Boris Yeltsin climbed on top of a tank in Moscow in front of the White House to defy a hardline coup and assert that “the democratic process in the country is acquiring an increasingly broad sweep and an irreversible character, the peoples of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny.”\n\nA quarter century later, no one would make that assertion in Moscow.",
  "By early March of last year, as it became glaringly obvious that Ukraine was fighting not just for its political soul but for national survival, support for the agenda of the pro-Maidan provisional government and the sense of solidarity under pressure started to flow south and east—into the very regions that both Putin and simplistic international media coverage had characterized as pro-Russian.",
  "A more objective and accurate version is that the unremitting and escalating crisis of the last year-and-a-half erupted in two stages: first, when Yanukovych reneged on a promised trade deal with Europe, part of a general turning away from the West, which set off a massive demonstration of people power; and then when, with Moscow’s support, he unleashed bloody force on the demonstrators.",
  "And that in turn probably accounts for the fact that, while there were no Ukrainian-Americans on the Kremlin’s blacklist, four of the 13 Canadians singled out were of Ukrainian extraction: in addition to myself, my fellow Canadian Member of Parliament James Bezan, Senator Raynell Andreychuk and Paul Grod, who has no national elective role but is head of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress.",
  "I made the Russian list of the unwelcome as a three-fer: an activist Ukrainian-Canadian, a politician (I was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 2013 to represent Toronto Centre) and a journalist with a long paper trail that frequently displeased the Kremlin, since I covered Moscow’s brutal war in Chechnya in the 1990s and also wrote a book about the rise of the Russian oligarchs.",
  "In July of that year, Bush traveled first to Moscow to shore up Gorbachev, then to Ukraine, where, on August 1, he delivered a speech to the Ukrainian Parliament exhorting his audience to give Gorbachev a chance at keeping a reforming Soviet Union together: \"Americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism.",
  "Four days earlier, nine people from the U.S. had been similarly blacklisted, including John Boehner, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Harry Reid, then the majority leader of the Senate, and three other senators: John McCain, a long-time critic of Putin, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Dan Coats of Indiana, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany.",
  "Through his virtual monopoly of the Russian media, Putin has airbrushed away the truth of what happened a quarter of a century ago: the dissolution of the USSR was the result not of Western manipulation but of the failings of the Soviet state, combined with the initiatives of Soviet reformist leaders who had widespread backing from their citizens.",
  "Recognizing that after centuries of rule from Moscow, Ukraine’s national consciousness was weak while its Communist Party was strong, they cut a tacit deal with the Ukrainian political leadership: In exchange for the Communists’ support for independence, the democratic opposition would postpone its demands for political and economic reform.",
  "Rick Wilking/Files/Reuters The address, which New York Times columnist William Safire memorably dubbed the “Chicken Kiev speech,” backfired in the United States as well, antagonizing Americans of Ukrainian descent and other East European diasporas, which may have hurt Bush’s chances of re-election, costing him support in several key states.",
  "Having broken up the Soviet Union, Moscow and Kiev both faced three immediate, vast and novel challenges: how to establish genuine statehood and independence for their brand new countries; create efficacious democracies with checks and balances and rule of law; and make the transition from the Communist command economy to capitalism.",
  "My aunt Tanya, who’d grown up in Ukraine, recalled that the slogan “Russians do not surrender” (“Russkiye ne sdayutsa”) was a famous battle cry of the Red Army during the Second World War, in which Ukraine bore the second most Soviet casualties in absolute numbers and suffered an even greater loss than Russia in proportional terms.",
  "But, as the covert occupation of Crimea, ordered by Putin and spearheaded by “little green men”—as the Russian soldiers without insignia who took over the peninsula were called—inched toward outright annexation, it quickly became apparent that peaceful tactics would not succeed against the near-term objectives of Putin.",
  "A comprehensive poll done in April by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, one of the country’s most respected polling firms, found, for instance, that in those regions of Ukraine 76.8 percent of respondents opposed the seizure of government buildings by separatist protesters; only 11.7 percent supported it.",
  "Putin’s big lie\n\nThe crisis that burst into the news a year-and-a-half ago has often been explained as Putin’s exploitation of divisions between the mainly Russian-speaking majority of Ukrainians in the eastern and southern regions of the country, and the mainly Ukrainian-speaking majority in the west and center.",
  "These have ranged from Tsar Alexander II’s 1876 “Ems Ukaz,” which banned the use of Ukrainian in print, on the stage or in public lectures and the 1863 Valuev ukaz that asserted that “the Ukrainian language has never existed, does not exist, and cannot exist,” to Stalin’s genocidal famine in the 1930s.",
  "While the linguistic factor is real, it is often oversimplified in several respects: Russian-speakers are by no means all pro-Putin or secessionist; Russian- and Ukrainian-speakers are geographically commingled; and virtually everyone in Ukraine has at least a passive understanding of both languages.",
  "But because many of the leaders of post-Soviet Ukraine had a genuine emotional connection to their country, they also took pride in building Ukrainian sovereignty, which put them at odds with some of their former colleagues in Russia, including, they would eventually discover, Vladimir Putin.",
  "That is why Mr. Putin hates what is happening so much, and doesn’t want Ukraine to escape his grip.”\n\nLeonid Bershidsky, a distinguished Russian journalist who was so appalled by what happened in his country in 2014 that he left, thinks that for Putin, February 22, 2014 was the tipping point.",
  "Post-Soviet Russia’s wrong turn came in the form of the Faustian bargain its first group of leaders—the Yeltsin team of economists known as the young reformers—was willing to strike in order to achieve their overriding priority: wrenching Russia from central planning to a market economy.",
  "Ukrainians were simultaneously celebrating their eviction of Yanukovych, mourning the victims of the slaughter on the Maidan, horrified by the invasion of Crimea and fearful of the possibility of a long, grinding war fanned and often directly waged by their giant neighbor to the north.",
  "The uprising in Ukraine and the fight between Ukraine and Russia is about many things—Ukraine’s consolidation as a nation, a wounded Russia’s rising nationalism, the uncertainty of a world in which the Cold War is over—but we haven’t quite figured out what will replace it.",
  "“Ukraine is functioning not through its government but through the self-organization of its people and their sense of human decency.”\n\nI found myself harking back to 1991, when Ukrainian democrats I interviewed felt they had to choose between democracy and sovereignty.",
  "When, in 2011, he decided to take the presidency back from his protégé, Dmitry Medvedev, I wrote a column in The New York Times arguing that Putin’s Russia was on its way to becoming a full-fledged dictatorship that would eventually be vulnerable to a popular uprising.",
  "But along the way they struck deals, most stunningly the vast handover of state assets to the oligarchs in exchange for their political support, which eventually transformed Russia into a kleptocracy and discredited the very idea of democracy with the Russian people.",
  "Back then, the leaders and many of the people of Ukraine and Russia shared the dream of joining the political West, a choice that was about much more than geopolitics—it meant choosing the rule of law, democracy and individual rights over authoritarian kleptocracy.",
  "His speech was heavily influenced by Condoleezza Rice, not a notable soft touch, and it echoed the United Kingdom’s Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, who, a year earlier, had said she could no more imagine opening a British embassy in Kiev than in San Francisco.",
  "In selling his revanchist policy to the Russian public, Putin has depicted Ukrainians who cherish their independence and want to join Europe and embrace the Western democratic values it represents as, at best, pawns and dupes of NATO—or, at worst, neo-Nazis.",
  "Second, the world would almost certainly never have heard of Putin had it not been for the dissolution of the USSR, which Putin has called “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.”\n\nLittle reform, big corruption\n\nThen came the hard part.",
  "Immediately after the overthrow and self-exile of Yanukovych, radical nationalists in Parliament passed a law making Ukrainian the sole national language—a self-destructive political gesture and a gratuitous insult to a large body of the population.",
  "As though to make amends for Parliament’s action, within 72 hours the people of Lviv, the capital of the Ukrainian-speaking west, held a Russian-speaking day, in which the whole city made a symbolic point of shifting to the country’s other language.",
  "This historic connectedness is one reason why their post-Soviet successor, Vladimir Putin, has been able to build such wide popular support in Russia for championing—and, as he is now trying to do, recreating—“Novorossiya” (New Russia) in Ukraine.",
  "When, two years ago, Ukraine celebrated its 22nd anniversary as an independent state, the longest period in modern history, it had—for all its troubles—at least avoided violent separatism within its own borders, not to mention a war with Russia.",
  "The Maidan and the return of history\n\nAccording to Putin’s propaganda, the original fault line was within Ukraine, in the form of ethnic tension, and only later did the conflict take on a geopolitical dimension and disrupt relations with Russia.",
  "It all started with Mikhail Gorbachev, who, when he came to power in 1985, was determined to revitalize a sclerotic economy and political system with “perestroika” (literally, rebuilding), “glasnost” (openness) and a degree of democratization.",
  "For the rest of my grandparents’ lives, they saw themselves as political exiles with a responsibility to keep alive the idea of an independent Ukraine, which had last existed, briefly, during and after the chaos of the 1917 Russian Revolution.",
  "Culturally, historically, linguistically and even religiously, southern and eastern Ukraine were quite different, and did not always appreciate the Galician assumption that the western Ukrainian version of Ukraine was the best and truest one.",
  "Even though the pact between Ukrainian reformers and the Communist Party left the nomenklatura, as the Soviet leadership class was known, essentially intact, it turned out to be remarkably—and mercifully—inept at authoritarian governance.",
  "Russia in those days was also part of the elite global group Goldman Sachs had dubbed the BRICs—the acronym stands for Brazil, Russia, India and China—the emerging market powerhouses that were expected to drive the world economy forward.",
  "To make matters more complicated, Russian is the first language of many ethnic Ukrainians, who are 78 percent of the population (but even that category is blurry, because many people in Ukraine have both Ukrainian and Russian roots).",
  "When I arrived at Bohdan’s high-ceilinged, post-war apartment on March 4, 2014, he and his wife, Tanya, like so many Kievites, were glued to their television and its coverage of the political tumult that followed Yanukovych’s ouster.",
  "They had also watched their reviled president, Yanukovych, flee to Russia, a provisional government take charge, Russian troops assert control over part of their country and Putin insist on his right to take further military action.",
  "First, Yeltsin—who plucked Putin from obscurity and hand-picked him as his successor—would not have been able to engineer Russia’s own emergence as an independent state had it not been for Ukraine’s eagerness to break free as well.",
  "Fantastical things are happening.”\n\nWestern Ukraine, known as Galicia, had long seen itself as the most nationally conscious region, the one that would lead a broader effort to knit the nation together and build a sovereign state.",
  "I spent a day in Dnipropetrovsk, a city just 150 miles from the Russian border, whose citizens are largely Russian-speaking and whose industry was vital to the Soviet Union (to wit: those SS-18 missiles Kuchma built for a living).",
  "The threat and the promise of Ukrainian democracy\n\nUkrainians today are proud of the democratic episodes in their country’s history, and in Kiev you are likely to hear the country described as culturally inclined toward democracy.",
  "He doesn’t need Ukraine for strategic reasons—Putin today is master of Crimea, but Russia is more isolated, less respected and surrounded by more suspicious neighbors than was the proud host of the Sochi Olympics just a year ago.",
  "Many ethnic Ukrainians were likewise successful in the Soviet nomenklatura, where these so-called younger brothers of the ruling Russians had a trusted and privileged place, comparable to the role of Scots in the British Empire.",
  "The once-elegant Khreshchatyk was a grimy tent city, the avenue itself denuded of its cobblestones because protesters had pulled them up to throw at the armored special forces who were firing tear gas and live bullets at them.",
  "Today, Canada’s Ukrainian community, which is 1.25 million strong, is significantly larger as a percentage of total population than the one in the United States, which is why it is also a far more significant political force.",
  "By softening the mailed-fist style of governing that traditionally accrued to his job, Gorbachev empowered other reformers—notably his protégé-turned-rival Boris Yeltsin—who wanted not to rebuild the USSR but to dismantle it.",
  "Once the superpower they had thrived in disappeared, these men, and most of those around them, adopted Ukrainian patriotism, soon proving themselves to be enthusiastic, determined and wily advocates of Ukrainian independence.",
  "Three months after that, I sat in my Kiev studio apartment—on a cobblestone street where the Russian-language writer Mikhail Bulgakov once lived—listening to Gorbachev’s televised plea to the Ukrainian people not to secede.",
  "That turned out to be the last year when Russia, despite its leadership’s increasingly despotic and xenophobic tendencies, was still, along with the major Western democracies and Japan, a member in good standing of the G-8.",
  "That said, I could sense, even in those early days, that Putin’s use of overwhelming Russian force to crush Ukrainian resistance was backfiring against his ultimate goal, which was to bring Ukraine back under Russian sway.",
  "An overwhelming 87.7 percent said that Ukraine should make its own decisions about internal affairs, such as constitutional structure and official language, without any involvement from outside powers, specifically Russia.",
  "In short, being a Russian-speaker in Ukraine does not automatically imply a yearning for subordination to the Kremlin any more than speaking English in Ireland or Scotland means support for a political union with England.",
  "Sobolev and Nayyem are both former journalists who had tried to uncover the skullduggery and looting of the Yanukovych regime, and then had been motivated to political action by their revulsion at Yanukovych’s brutality.",
  "Ukrainian democratic reformers and dissidents seized the chance to advance their own agenda—political liberalization and Ukrainian statehood—so that their country could be free forever from the dictates of the Kremlin.",
  "Now Russia, at least as represented by the most powerful Kremlin leader since Stalin, has turned its back on that dream, while Ukraine’s leader, with the backing of most of his people, is determined to keep it alive.",
  "In those first days of March, for example, Maksym Emelyanenko, captain of the corvette Ternopil in the Ukrainian navy, was ordered by the commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet to hand over control of his vessel.",

  "Four days after I arrived in Kiev, Serhiy Zhadan, described by The New Yorker as Ukraine’s “best-known poet” and “most famous counter-culture writer,” was beaten by pro-Russian agitators at a Maidan demonstration.",
  "Freeland is author of Sale of the Century, a book about Russia’s transition from communism to capitalism, and the award-winning book Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else.",

  "On March 24 last year, I was in my Toronto kitchen preparing school lunches for my kids when I learned from my Twitter feed that I had been put on the Kremlin’s list of Westerners who were banned from Russia.",
  "Now that civil society’s common enemy was Yanukovych and the Kremlin political values he represented, speaking Ukrainian in public came to symbolize the fight for democracy, notably including in the east.",

  "Their mission was to lay bouquets on the two-story-high mountain of flowers in tribute to the victims of police and snipers, known as the Heavenly Hundred (it sounds less mawkish in Ukrainian).",
  "One of the paradoxical consequences of the Russian invasion was that southern and eastern Ukraine were proudly asserting their versions of Ukrainian identity as equally authentic and powerful.",
  "At its heart, however, the conflicts within Ukraine, and the fight Putin has picked with Ukraine, are about post-Soviet kleptocracy, and where and whether there is a popular will to resist it.",
  "On August 19, a feckless attempt by Russian hardliners to overthrow Gorbachev triggered a stampede to the exits by the non-Russian republics, especially in the Baltic States and Ukraine.",
  "President Viktor Yanukovych’s flight from Ukraine in the face of the Maidan uprising, which took place on the eve of the closing day of those Winter Games, astonished and enraged Putin.",

  "Baz Ratner/Reuters\n\n“People in Odessa, Mykolaev, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk [all cities with large Russian-speaking populations] are coming out to defend their country,” Sobolev said.",

  "For his part, Sobolev told me he had overcome his “psychological barrier” to speaking Ukrainian by reading For Whom the Bell Tolls in Ukrainian translation out loud to himself.",
