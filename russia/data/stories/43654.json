  "Whether it was the lawyers who won in crafting a non-statement statement; whether the slightly on-the-spectrum lack of emotional resonance in the response echoes Silicon Valley tech culture; or whether somehow Mr. Zuckerberg crafted the response himself, and misguidedly thought it would be sufficient — the result is the same: the announcement itself was sorely lacking.",
  "Facebook's unique power and influence\n\nLike it or not, Facebook has almost turned into a global utility — and unless it wants to be regulated as such, Mr. Zuckerberg must act as if he understands and acknowledges Facebook’s unique position and power on our planet, and is ready to lean into it and the company's proper role in deploying it.",
  "\"I am sorry that this happened,\" just doesn't come up to the standard of what was needed, which was more like, \"On behalf of myself and each and every one of us at Facebook, I want to deeply apologize to the public for what can be called no less than a breach of trust with potentially catastrophic world consequences.",
  "As a crisis advisor and coach who has crafted hundreds of what I hope are truly on-point, effective, and emotionally resonant crisis responses, here’s what I wish Mark Zuckerberg had done to give the world a response worthy of Facebook's vast global power and influence:\n\n1.",
  "Instead, the statement needed to lead with the lead: a quotable, heartfelt statement of outrage, resolve to get to the bottom of what happened, acknowledgment of errors, and commitment to work indefatigably to never let it happen again.",
  "Even though he could not know or say everything, he knew enough and could have become the trusted voice in the room, ready to communicate first and frequently, and in stages, as he knew more, and could say more.",
  "Because they were too small, too technical, too uninspired, too purposefully ignoring the import that Facebook's breach has had on humanity — and that is dangerous for the company and the world.",
  "While there is enough blame to place everywhere, somehow the acknowledgment of responsibility in the statement seemed too paltry, too much like a kid who acknowledges he cheated on an exam.",
  "In fact, the malfeasance of those hijacking Facebook’s data may have changed the outcome of our national election, as well as sent the world careening down numerous perilous paths.",
  "But you can begin to earn that trust back by being specific, by communicating constantly, by outlining your grandest vision, and by doing what you say, and saying what you will do.",
  "We have trusted it enough to bring it into our homes and bedrooms, our commutes and workplaces, our friendships and our families until it has almost reached ubiquity.",
  "So Facebook’s responses to such a larger-than-life issue as this — the possible dissolution of our sovereign decision-making process — must be bigger than life, too.",
  "It is true that Silicon Valley is not known for its emotional intelligence, but if ever there was a time to rise above one's origins, for Facebook this was it.",
  "He needed to own the narrative after his company's efforts to quash the stories were unsuccessful, but by waiting so long, he gave away his public control.",
  "This week, Facebook shirked that responsibility through its terribly late and insufficient response to the Cambridge Analytica data hijacking scandal.",
  "The written statement appeared to be written by lawyers, who spend pages laying out the \"facts\" in an affidavit before they get to the good parts.",
  "Understand the message needs an emotionally resonant tone and content — commensurate with the issue, in its grandest geopolitical interpretation.",
  "Facebook is redefining our world by connecting it — its CEO has a responsibility to embrace that reality, and help lead us through it honorably.",
  "Not, I would submit to you, by going radio silent for 4 days, and then issuing a long, winding and essentially unsatisfying written statement.",
  "The world, and especially we loyal Facebook users, needed to hear an unequivocal apology — one that rang true emotionally and operationally.",
  "Delight us with new thinking, on how you can protect us, even while giving us new toys and communication/connectivity channels to play with.",
  "Instead what was needed was a global awareness of the possible repercussions of such a breach, and misuse of personal data.",
  "The role is yours for the taking -- why not redefine yourself yet again, and step up to it on a very grand scale, indeed?",
  "Of course every company and organization must protect itself legally... but it also must rise to a higher standard.",
  "The long-awaited statement was no place for a recitation of facts — that could have been in an addendum somewhere.",
  "We will do everything in our power to address the damage, and never let it happen at this magnitude again...\"\n\n3.",
  "It turns out Facebook is far, far more powerful than any of us — even they, even Mark Zuckerberg — ever thought.",
  "In many ways, that which was included in the statement was too general, with too much of a \"trust us\" flavor.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, this country and this world need a superhero right now to show us the way through our mess.",
  "And even though his personal appearance on CNN did make it better, all responses still missed the mark.",
  "Start with effect and apology ... and do not delegate those messages to the team; carry the weight.",
  "We are outraged, appalled, and extraordinarily sorry this happened at our company, on our watch.",
  "Face your power and influence and role... turn into a statesman, truth teller, and moral center.",
  "Outline a highly specific strategy and tactical plan to address this situation, and the future.",
  "These are the biggest of leagues, and a statement needed to acknowledge that, not minimize it.",
  "So, it is critical to acknowledge Facebook's unique public trust, and public role more fully.",
  "You know that Marianne Williamson quote: \"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.",
  "Larger than life\n\nFacebook has been larger than life in our worlds for over a decade.",
  "How does a leader, a company, respond to such earth-shaking charges, and realities?",
  "The correct crisis response in this case needed more of a diplomatic angle.",
  "And in a crisis, you do need to maintain as much control as possible.",
  "Give us a real reason to trust your response and your promises.",
  "Respond immediately to the crisis, in the moment, as it broke.",
  "This of course plays terribly in the court of public opinion.",
  "Acknowledge responsibility in a non-self-flagellating way.",
  "And Facebook let it happen, either passively or actively.",
  "And with such awesome power comes awesome responsibility.",
  "Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure\"?",
  "Remember, right now, NO ONE trusts Facebook very much.",
  "Understand that it is time for Facebook to grow up.",
  "Don’t structure a statement like a legal brief.",
  "Begin to do it, with every single interaction.",
  "Don’t just talk about rebuilding trust.",
  "There is no room for anything else.",
  "Well so it is with Facebook.",
  "Help us have safe fun.",
  "And far, far better.",
