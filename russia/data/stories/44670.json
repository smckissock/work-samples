  "He literally said to Rain, ‘I’m not happy what I have in the can,’ meaning the Martin Balsam recording that had been done a year before.",
  "When I spoke to a linguist he said absolutely that HAL does not have a mid-Atlantic accent as Kubrick kind of thought.",
  "I think if Kubrick had kept all of the explanatory things it wouldn’t it wouldn’t be the classic that it is.",
  "So the voice was probably just a combination of circumstance and a gut choice by Kubrick.",
  "It would be like Alec Guinness being known just for Obi-Wan Kenobi and nothing else.",
  "‘Would you like to play the computer?’ And then, in a day and a half, it was done.",
  "But I’m sure if I were Rain I wouldn’t want it to define my career.",
  "And even before that it was going to be a female voice.",
  "It was going to be Martin Balsam’s voice.",
  "Rain move from there to becoming HAL?",
  "Rain indifferent toward the film?",
  "It’s Standard Canadian English.",
  "HAL was going to be an Athena.",
  "So how did Mr.",
  "Why is Mr."
