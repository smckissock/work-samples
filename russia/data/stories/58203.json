  "So when you think about those kinds of works, and of course, I respect the rights of owners to do whatever they will with their players within the bounds of the law, but when you think about it in that context, it's just so inappropriate, and it's something that they shouldn't say, and they should really change their way of being around the issue like this.",
  "Perhaps more worrisome for the White House tonight, there was a surprise that ex-Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Advisor, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had in 2016 with a professor close to the Russian government, who claims he had dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Sarah Sanders tried to downplay his role.",
  "And what that means to those players and how hurtful that is to a team that for a lot of these protests have really said we respect our owner and we're not going to engage, and now because our owner has sort of slapped us in the face with this language that some would argue is racially insensitive, it's morally insensitive, inconceivable, right?",
  "I want to take your attention to the 2020 presidential race, which apparently is already, sort of, bubbling up out there, and there's a lot of suggestion that President Trump could potentially face a challenger, or that he might decide not to run, even from two gentlemen who share that stage with him, as you did as well.",
  "I meet with people in the Hollywood elite on a regular basis and they tell me that this kind of stuff has been going on for years and it is something that now that everyone is being able to come out and actually be protected in that way that there's going to be a lot more stories come out like this.",
  "MACCALLUM: So Matt, in terms of the $10 to $12 million that was funneled through Perkins Coie in order to fund this dossier through Fusion GPS, many are saying that that's a clearer link to trying to get Russian help to influence the election and pretty much anything they've seen on the Trump side.",
  "They talk about the president of the Ukraine fleeing to Moscow --\n\nMACCALLUM: We have that quote actually -- we pulled that out, and let me put it on the screen while you explain why you picked out this sentence and why you think that it was -- it reflects politicalization of this document.",
  "The two men facing up to 20 years in prison and the 12-count indictment charging conspiracy to launder money, dating back to around 2006 -- allegedly funneling $75 million through shell companies while working for a pro-Russian political party in the Ukraine years before the 2016 election.",

  "It sounds like people who have a little tiny bit of access in one case, but in Paul Manafort, he was obviously, you know, the campaign manager and he is somebody who obviously was trying to -- had other business dealings that he was trying to move forward, obviously.",
  "MACCALLUM: And there's, you know, specific quotes from Paul Manafort saying that he does not -- you know, just to make it clear, the president's not going to take any meeting of that sort, and, you know, somebody should let down the chain, should let them know that.",
  "You know, the property tax, that's a step forward, but the fact they still want to keep the state income tax out, to me, that would have a real impact on my constituents, and I cannot sign onto that certainly at this stage because I want everyone to get a tax cut.",
  "As far as Papadopoulos, I really -- I never heard of him, I didn't know anything about him, and it seemed to me -- I don't want to prejudge it, but if you're going to be involved in some sort of collusion, you're not going to pick someone that no one has heard of.",
  "So, in terms of actual collusion in that election, legal expert, Andrew McCarthy, writes a national review, \"The Paul Manafort indictment is much to do about nothing, except as a vehicle to squeeze in Manafort, which is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's objective.\"",
  "MARK BENNETT, THIRD WAY CO-FOUNDER: Well, I don't know who these many are, but here's a couple of things that are true, first of all, much of what is in the dossier the U.S. intelligence services says is probably true, is what Trace said I don't think is right.",
  "Then you have Obama for America, about 20 percent of their expenditure in 2016, $972,000 goes to this law firm, then you have somebody in the communications team at the White House, the Obama White House, whose husband happens to just work for Fusion GPS.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to make sure that the White House, that President Trump, does not fire Robert Mueller because that would be clearly something that he would be considering right now in order to shut down this investigation.",

  "And I understand why the president is frustrated because he can only say there was no collusion so many times and then you look at the Uranium One deal, you look at what's going on with the DNC and others, paying for this mysterious dossier.",

  "The second thing about this indictment that I myself find most particular is the claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal from the United States government is ridiculous.",
  "But then there's an expectation from the senior most leadership that you hand over your voting card, and you get inline, and you support everything they did, and I just wasn't that guy, and that's not what I did, and I think he -- you know.",

  "And one of the president's top lawyers Ty Cobb says, the White House is not worried at all about Mueller squeezing either Manafort or potentially down the road former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn.",
  "Now these players have taken a knee and they've said this will continue because this owner has now tried to say, oh, if I really wasn't talking about you guys, which, obviously, the audience he's talking about that.",
