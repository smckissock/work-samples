  "In a press release issued Monday, the pan-European policing agency Europol explained the enormous losses caused to banks who fell victim to the malware, which affected 12 countries over the course of four years.",
  "The agency listed nations which had been affected as the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Romania, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Taiwan, and Thailand.",
  "These include direct electronic transfers from bank funds to criminal accounts, and also editing bank databases to inflate the contents of given accounts, which could then be emptied.",
  "Both pieces of malware were distributed by so-called spear-phishing attacks on employees in banks — targeted fake emails designed to trick people into compromising their machines.",
  "Business Insider/YouTube\n\nThe suspected mastermind of a billion-dollar cybercrime network, which tricked ATMs into spitting out cash unprompted, has been arrested.",
  "According to European police, the head of a criminal gang behind widespread pieces of malware, called Carbanak and Cobalt, was detained in Alicante, Spain.",
  "Europol said the operation involved its own agents, Spain's national police, the FBI, Romanian, Belorussian, and Taiwanese enforcement agencies.",
  "To anybody not paying close attention, it could look like a regular withdrawal, and once the cash is gone it is very difficult to trace.",
  "One of the more eye-catching methods used to remove cash from banks was by tricking ATM machines to spit out money for no reason.",
  "Europol said the cash was then converted into cryptocurrency wallets, a method increasingly favoured by organised criminals.",
  "El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper, published video of a suspect in the attack being given money by an ATM without touching it.",
  "Surveillance video shows a man removing cash from an ATM without entering any information as part of the malware attack.",
  "The machines could be instructed to dispense a predetermined amount of cash at a given location and time.",
  "Criminal gangs would then send people to stand by the ATM at the right moment and pick up the cash.",
  "Europol\n\nHackers were then able to take over internal bank systems and syphon huge amounts of cash.",
  "A man can be seen being led to a police car, but his identity is obscured by a hood.",
  "He waits a short while and is given another delivery of cash, then walks away.",
  "The gangs also used other methods to extract cash from banks, Europol said.",
  "The total cost was estimated at €1 billion ($1.2 billion, £870,000).",
  "He was named in Spanish media as Denis K., a Ukrainian national.",
  "Spain's national police released a video showing the arrest.",
  "A map showing countries affected by the malware."
