  "And Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov admitted that the Kremlin had maintained contacts with Trump during the campaign: “Obviously we know most of the people from his entourage.”\n\nThat entourage at one time included former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who is linked to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, and policy adviser Carter Page, who is linked to Russia oil giant Gazprom.",

  "(Photo: Boris Pejovic, epa)\n\n“There shouldn’t be any doubt in anybody’s minds, this was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily.",
  "We can only hope that Russia does not succeed in reestablishing its empire and swallowing some of America’s more vulnerable allies in Eastern Europe before Trump wakes up to the fact that Putin is not America’s friend.",
