  "WASHINGTON — The mysterious disappearance and possible murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey is reverberating from Wall Street and Silicon Valley to Washington’s K Street, with lobbyists, financiers, high-tech executives and media figures confronting the risk of doing business with Saudi Arabia when it is under harsh scrutiny for its role in the case.",
  "One of the roughly 10 lobbying firms that represent the Saudi government, the Harbour Group, has dropped it as a client, and others are considering following suit, according to people familiar with discussions, as Saudi Arabia struggles with a backlash over allegations that it murdered the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.",
  "The Harbour Group, which was being paid $80,000 a month to represent the Saudi Embassy in Washington, sent a letter on Thursday ending its contract, said Richard Mintz, the firm’s managing director.",
  "But some have already decided that the prospect of continued paychecks from Saudi Arabia — once a prized and profitable client — is not worth the risk to their reputations.",
  "The lobbying firms are privately discussing how to proceed, these people said."
