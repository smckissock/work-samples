  "The New York investment firm Columbus Nova said it retained Cohen as a consultant “regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.” Though Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the company said Vekselberg was not involved with hiring or paying Cohen.",
  "“Vekselberg, who is close to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, was one of two dozen Russian business executives and government officials sanctioned in April as part of the U.S. response to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in southern England.”\n\nEssential Consultants also seems to be a repository for huge amounts of corporate cash.",
  "Opinion writer\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nPresident Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen was hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump’s inauguration and was recently subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, the company said Tuesday.",
  "A spokesman for AT&T confirmed that the company engaged Essential Consultants, a company formed by Cohen in early 2017, ‘to provide insights into understanding the new administration.’ ”) It is hard to understand how a shady fixer like Cohen could have “insights” worth $200,000.",
  "The company’s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016.",
  "(“The document from [Michael] Avenatti says AT&T paid Cohen $50,000 a month for four months starting in October 2017, just weeks before Trump’s Justice Department filed suit to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner.",
  "On the other hand, it is possible — a full-scale deep dive into Cohen’s finances would be required– this was the quintessential slush fund where monies came in and then were redirected for Trump’s benefit.",
  "“The payments from Columbus Nova point to a potential new financial tie between the president’s personal lawyer and a U.S. representative of a key Russian figure,” The Post explains.",
  "Those who suspected the president would be far more anxious about the Cohen investigation than special prosecutor Robert S. Mueller’s probe might be proven right.",
  "We trust that the Southern District of New York’s prosecutors and FBI office, with a wealth of material seized from Cohen, will get to the bottom of this.",
  "Each has important business considerations with the U.S. government.”)\n\nTheoretically, all of these transactions could be perfectly innocuous.",
  "No objective viewer can deny there is a basis for investigating the money flow between Trump and Cohen and between outside funders and Cohen.",
  "Presumably, the federal raid on Cohen’s office, hotel and residence that scooped up Cohen’s records will tell us exactly what was going on.",
  "He claims that Cohen also received payments from the drug company Novartis Investments and from Korea Aerospace Industries.",
  "What is clear is that anyone who definitively declares Cohen and Trump have no Russia connections isn’t paying attention.",
  "Cohen could have performed verifiable services, received money in payment and paid taxes on income he received.",
  "If one wants to find a financial nexus between the Trump camp and Russia, this might be it.",
  "Maybe Vekselberg was not only uninvolved in the payments but entirely ignorant of them.",
  "(“Avenatti’s document might provide a road map to those clients.",
  "Moreover, AT &T was not the only corporate source of funds.",
  "He might never have even mentioned the payments to Trump.",
  "We simply do not know.",
  "Nothing to see here.",
  "Move along."
