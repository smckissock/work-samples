  "y Daniel Shirey/Getty Images for American Express\n\nSnapchat on Tuesday introduced two new features: group video calls with up to 16 people and the ability to tag friends in Stories.",
  "In December 2016, Facebook Messenger introduced a group video chat feature (Facebook video chat feature was itself a clone of an up-and-coming video chat startup called Houseparty).",
  "After seeing its best features cloned by Facebook for years, Snapchat is turning the tables and introducing features to its app that its competitor had first.",
  "And Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, already lets users tag others in Stories â€” though the idea of a \"Story\" is from Snapchat in the first place.",
  "Even though these features aren't entirely new, both may change how you interact with friends inside the Snapchat app.",
  "In a blog post, Snap Inc., Snapchat's parent company, said the updates will roll out to every user this week.",
  "Group video chatting has been popular for years, as this 2017 photo of Shaq and friend shows.",
  "Here's a look at Snapchat's two new features:",
  "Now Snapchat is getting in on the action."
