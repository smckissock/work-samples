  "Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seemed to lack a grasp of basic details of the hack that led to WikiLeaks publishing the Democratic National Committee’s emails, and WikiLeaks said Friday that “Clapper gets literally everything wrong.”\n\n“In April, Russia used a third party ‘cut-out’ to send more than 19,000 DNC emails and more than 8,000 documents to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, attempting to cover its tracks and to give WikiLeaks some degree of deniability in knowing the source of the leaks,” Clapper wrote in his new book “Facts and Fears: Hard Truths From a Life in Intelligence.”\n\nWikileaks shot back on Friday:\n\nThe published DNC emails go through to May 25–making “April” an impossibility.",
  "(RELATED: Most Wikileaks Emails Weren’t Even Written Until AFTER DNC Knew It Was Hacked)\n\nThe DNC declined to give its server to the FBI as evidence, and the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community relied in part on CrowdStrike’s private analysis to form its conclusions about the hack — despite the company taking weeks to stem the bleeding.",
  "It’s possible that, if Clapper’s statement is accurate, there could have been more emails sent in April that WikiLeaks did not publish or that there was another source Clapper monitored but was not the origin of what WikiLeaks ultimately published.",
  "Clapper, who left government on Jan. 20, 2017, said that by the time he left office, U.S. officials had identified a “cut-out”, or middleman, selected by Russian intelligence to pass 19,000 stolen DNC emails to WikiLeaks in April 2016.",
  "— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 15, 2018\n\nOf the 27,500 DNC emails WikiLeaks published, fewer than 7,000 pre-date April 29, as The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported.",
  "But CrowdStrike’s presence did not stop the flow, and the majority of the emails weren’t even written, much less stolen, until after the company was already on the scene.",

  "Clapper gets literally everything wrong–but admits he doesn’t know who our sources are.",
  "WikiLeaks has said it did not get the emails from Russia.",
