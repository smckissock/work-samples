  "Just the FAQs\n\nFacebook (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON – Former president Barack Obama's top campaign aide on Tuesday rejected comparisons between Obama's extensive use of Facebook data to turn out voters in the 2012 election and the actions of Cambridge Analytica, a data and political intelligence firm ejected last week by Facebook in a growing controversy over social-media privacy.",
  "Patrick Ruffini, a co-founder Echelon Insights, a Republican-leaning digital analytics and research firm, said the public outrage this week over the disclosures about Cambridge Analytica \"feels like a double standard\" against the backdrop of how the Obama campaign and other Democratic and Republican political operatives sought to use Facebook data during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles.",

  "For instance, the Obama campaign could use the data to glean the identities of a Facebook user's friends in a swing state such as Ohio, and then send messages to that Facebook user, urging her to encourage those friends to go vote early in the state.",
  "Tech experts say Facebook helped build its business by deciding in 2007 to allow third parties who created apps on its platforms to gain access to the personal information of Facebook users, including information about their \"friends.\"",
  "In the case of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook says a researcher from Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, used a personality quiz app in 2014 to gain access to the data of 270,000 Facebook users, including their friends and \"likes.\"",
  "But in the years in between, developers of everything from dating apps to voter-outreach tools used by the Obama campaign, capitalized on Facebook's rules to extract massive amounts of data about Facebook users and their friends.",
  "Under the theory that voters are more likely respond to calls to action from their friends instead of a generic political ad, the campaign then used the data it harvested to promote \"friend-to-friend\" communication.",
  "Facebook said the researcher's unauthorized transfer of the data to Cambridge Analytica broke the social-network company's rules and on Friday, suspended Cambridge Analytica from the platform.",
  "“Cambridge Analytica obtained their data fraudulently, laundered through a researcher who paid people to install an app,” Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, wrote on Twitter.",

  "In 2014, \"had Cambridge Analytica just put out the app themselves, they would have been playing by the rules,\" Ruffini said.",
  "Cambridge Analytica obtained their data fraudulently, laundered through a researcher who paid people to install an app.",
  "\"The information they had wasn't all that different from what the Obama campaign had in its database.\"",
  "\"The '12 campaign told voters what they were sharing and for what purpose,\" Messina wrote.",
