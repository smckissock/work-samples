  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 10, 2018\n\nTrump bestowed Feinstein with the nickname of “sneaky” just a week after dubbing ousted Breitbart chief Steve Bannon “sloppy.”\n\nWATCH:\n\nFeinstein justified her unilateral decision to release the testimony by saying it was the only way to put to rest “the innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript” which “are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice.”\n\nThe released testimony revealed that Simpson had no idea whether the claims in the salacious document — compiled by his own firm — are true.",
  "The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace.",
