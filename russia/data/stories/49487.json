  "I think they're feeling that, whether it's been with the fact that we've sanctioned just recently the Russian oligarchs which made their stock market plummet, whether it's the fact that we gave arms to Ukraine, which makes them realize that their life is about to get harder in that region, whether it's us sending 60 spies home to let them know that we're not going to put up with you using a chemical agent anywhere, or whether the sanctions that are continuing to happen which you'll see again on Monday.",
  "What -- what is interesting is this revelation of Comey kind of admitting, you know, I was thinking about politics as I was going through some of these decisions regarding what I would say about Hillary and he's sort of confessing that he got that wrong or -- you know, and what that tells me is, this is a guy who's kind of bad at spin, says he shouldn't do spin because it's inappropriate to his role, and then keeps trying to do spin.",
  "Jonah, what do you make of the president's -- I think it's fair to say -- furious reaction to the raid of his long-time personal lawyer, some say fixer, I guess Cohen likes to call himself a fixer, Michael Cohen, and the fact that he left in that same event, left open, wide open the question of whether or not he's going to fire Robert Mueller?",
  "WALLACE: And what do you think of the criticism of the lack of a strategy and the idea that it's OK -- OK is the wrong word, I'm going to stop saying it -- that we will turn a blind eye to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands, maybe a half million civilians unless it's chemical weapons and unless there is video of it that the president sees.",
  "I've got to say just one final thing, how we all have to sort of sit back and think how extraordinary it is the former director of this large police law enforcement agency is calling the president of the United States somebody he thought of as a mafia boss, on the one hand, and the president responding calling him a slime ball.",
  "I thought your question to Nikki Haley -- and I should fully disclose, my wife works for Nikki Haley -- was interesting in the sense that she didn't have a great answer to the question of, was it OK for Assad to slaughter civilians with conventional weapons but we're going to step in with -- if you use chemical weapons?",
  "One of the things that I found unique was the fact that the former director actually talked about there being classified information that we still don't know about relating to Attorney General Lynch that would have compromised her, which also influenced his decisions in the -- in the Hillary Clinton investigation.",

  "Can you argue that it is a reasonable policy to say, look, we're not going to get sucked into this civil war, we're not going to get on the ground, we're not going to stop all the slaughter, but we are going to enforce the principle, no chemical weapons?",

  "I'm not sure that is a super coherent strategy going forward, because, first of all, let Assad continue to wipe out his domestic enemies and it doesn't really change the status quo on the ground.",
  "So, the question now for the president is, the use of chlorine bombs in the future, is that the red line and is the U.S. and are its allies required to respond military if he uses chlorine bombs?",

  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Question, do you still think -- we talked several weeks ago -- do you still think it would be wrong, it would be a serious mistake to fire Mueller?",

  "GRIFFIN: I think there is a natural tension between the Pentagon officials, Defense Secretary Mattis being in the lead and other national security officials.",
  "I do think that the problem for Comey is that he is basically trying to get down on Trump's level on the one hand, while seeming above the fray on the other.",

  "WALLACE: When we come back, more on the FBI raid of the president's personal lawyer and Mr. Trump's ongoing face-off with the special counsel.",
  "Assad knew that Russia would cover for him at the United Nations, and Assad got reckless and he used it in a way that was far more aggressive.",
  "He sees the Syrian civil war as a way to bleed Russia resources, a way to bleed Iran's resources, a way to diminish their role in the region.",

  "And we also know it must have nothing to do with Bob Mueller's probe, either directly or indirectly, or he would not have referred it.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRIFFIN: I think it's by having limited strikes and that is why Secretary Mattis pushed for such limited, targeted strike.",
  "And I think that one of the things that Donald Trump has made clear is that when there's video of kids suffering, he responds to that.",
  "There is multiple issues we have with Russia right now and what they're doing, whether it's the chemical weapons use in Great Britain.",
  "What I can tell you is the president has made it very clear when it comes to weapons of mass destruction, we have no tolerance for it.",

  "We will continue to do sanctions on Syria, and I think that's where the president's leadership is that we are going to respond.",
  "There was a real emotional string to Syria and I think we need to be conscious of the fact that's really where they want to go.",

  "And so -- so I think you have to really watch, what does the president say about Rod Rosenstein in the coming (INAUDIBLE).",
  "And I think he just continues that narrative of flip-flopping his stories and having not a lot of credibility in the book.",

  "And it's also appropriate because we have jurisdiction over the Office of Government Ethics to look into his lease.",
  "But are you saying that going forward any use of chemical weapons by Assad will trigger an immediate U.S. response?",
  "So all of the complaints he had about President Trump, he was willing to put those aside so he could keep his job.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Congressman, what do you think of Comey's answer and what do you think of Comey's book?",
