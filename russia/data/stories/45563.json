  "In fact, analysts looking for ways to wrap their heads around the Facebook disappointment and look ahead to the next big thing asked a revealing question on the Wednesday conference call:\n\nGiven the massive data center investments the company has made, are there ways to improve the return on investment of those investments, \"perhaps service third-parties to maybe just improve those returns in the way that other tech and internet companies have in terms of investments in infrastructure.\"",
  "For investors trying to make sense of the huge decline in Facebook shares and where the social media giant — and the rest of the FANG stocks — go from here, there is a simple and compelling way to think about it: a major fault line has been exposed in the market's dominant stocks, and it has been a make-or-break issue this earnings season.",
  "\"The enterprise guys and cloud players have a much easier time, as well as competitive dynamics that are benefitting the clear winners, whereas on the consumer side it is becoming a much more crowded, competitive landscape and some of traditional sweetpots have backfired from a growth perspective for FB and NFLX.\"",
  "Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights, said this divide between secular trends within the FANG group of stocks — the cloud trend on one side and the consumer trend on the other — is key right now to understanding tech stocks.",
  "With both Facebook FB and Netflix NFLX taking a hit on earnings, it is important to remember that the growth metrics for these two tech leaders are focused on signing up more consumers — in Facebook's case it is users and in the case of Netflix it is subscribers.",
  "Alphabe GOOGL t CEO Sundar Pichai, on the other hand, talked up the cloud growth its earnings called and said rather than seeing it as a zero sum competition right now, there is business growth for all the major players still to come.",
  "To be clear, Facebook has many company-specific concerns — the Cambridge Analytica hangover and widespread privacy concerns and Newsfeed issues still unresolved after the election.",
  "At least right now it is better to be selling the cloud to businesses than relying on cloud to offer services to the hordes of consumers needed to keep growth metrics moving up.",
  "\"There is a massive transformation in the cloud and a growth trend giving major power to Amazon AMZN 's AWZ, Microsoft MSFT 's Azure and up-and-coming cloud player Alphabet.",
  "But Alphabet and Microsoft, focused on getting more businesses and profit from enterprise cloud services, received a positive response from investors after reporting.",
  "FANG has always been a mix of consumer discretionary and actual technology, and the actual tech part is more important right now to short-term investor confidence.",
  "Facebook and Netflix both rely on growth of users/subscribers, and both FANG stocks disappointed on this key growth metric leading to post-earnings declines.",
  "Ives said Netflix has owned streaming but the U.S. market but the miss on international subscriber growth was the culprit for softer earnings and guidance.",
  "Amazon, with investors focused on both consumer metrics like Prime memberships and its booming AWS cloud business, could break either way when it reports.",
  "Google and Microsoft received a positive response from Wall Street after earnings backed by strong growth in enterprise — specifically, the cloud.",
  "FANG has always been a mix of consumer discretionary and technology, but it is the core technology side of it that is winning right now.",
  "He said it makes sense that Zuckerberg dismissed the idea of getting into the cloud services game as that is not in its core DNA.",
  "But there also is the more general question about what is the next big driver, even with Instagram \"white hot,\" Ives said.",
  "Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the idea: \"I mean the quick answer is that we're not planning on going in to the cloud services.",
  "It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.\"",
  "\"With FB and NFLX, their sweet spot, their DNA has been growth domestically and looking to expand internationally.",
  "At the risk of oversimplification, it is better to be a seller of the cloud than a major user of it.",
  "Netflix, already saturating the U.S. market, fell short on adding international subscribers.",
  "Facebook's highly profitable North America growth has been stagnant and disappointing.",
  "But it still leaves the question of what new growth drivers the company can unlock.",
  "Facebook fell short on users in its most profitable market, North America.",
  "\"It is one of most difficult periods in its 14-year history,\" Ives said.",
  "When you look on the enterprise side, it is a unique secular trend.",
  "We have to build out all this capacity to serve our community.",
  "We're staring at a fork in the road situation,\" Ives said.",
  "We're not planning on doing that.",
  "Story continues",
