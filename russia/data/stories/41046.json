  "Even if Assad regains complete control, a militarised resource company will no doubt create a situation similar to Ecuador, in which foreign oil firms dictate the political arrangements of their local environment, effectively usurping the state and that state's military so that it is the oil and not the people who are protected.",
  "Gazprom has groomed its relationship with Assad over the years, so much so that a rival offer by Qatar to construct a gas pipeline was brushed aside by the Syrian leader, who cited his country's excellent relations with the Kremlin and Gazprom specifically as the preferred operator of new hydrocarbon fields.",
  "As Gazprom adds even military-grade drones to its security assets, we must wait to see whether Assad is able to control the foreign oil and gas companies operating in his country, or whether it is these firms, with the oil and gas assets firmly under their control, who command him.",
  "That same year, 2007, there was a similar shift in the nexus between business and security in Russia when Moscow's parliament voted to allow its energy giants Gazprom and Transneft to effectively create their own militaries, with weapons and technology supplied by the Kremlin.",
  "The next logical step is to merge the two: newly armed energy firms become militarised resource companies (MRCs), a wealthier and more resource-rich counterpart to private military companies (PMCs) such as Blackwater.",
  "One of the military contracting firms, Blackwater (now Academi), saw four of its security contractors charged with killing 31 people at a Baghdad roadside shooting in 2007 (sentences which were overturned last year).",
  "If Russia wishes to realise a long-term goal of turning Syria into an energy transit hub for unrestricted sales in Asia, it will be expected to pump $30 billion or more into restoring Syria's energy infrastructure.",
  "The move effectively sent the message that Iraqi oil was for sale but not its sovereignty, meaning that contractors (and multinational companies) were banned from guarding oil and gas installations.",

  "A monument to Ukrainian poet and writer Taras Shevchenko is silhouetted against an apartment building with a sign advertising Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom, in Moscow, Russia.",
  "In fact, Russia's energy firms have followed a trend first started by British oil and gas firms, many of which have hired security contractors for operations in unstable regions.",
  "While Russia has been accused of using mercenaries in Syria, the next move is to export influential corporations that come with an integrated military (under state supervision).",
  "With a well-armed corporate militia, Gazprom and others can aggressively protect assets at home and abroad, and may soon play a major role in Russia's energy plans for Syria.",
  "Without the presence of international energy firms, Iraq's already tumultuous economy would worsen in a country where almost 50% of its GDP relies on hydrocarbon sales.",
  "In an effort to combat the risk of such political erosion, Iraq attempted to regulate the activities of military contractors by establishing the so-called Oil Police.",
  "Should Russia deepen its activities in Syria through Gazprom, it will be exporting Gazprom's corporate military to an already politically complex and fragile region.",
  "Assad has responded generously with an invitation to such firms promising lucrative incentives for companies willing to restore Syria's energy infrastructure.",
  "Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP Photo Gazprom is already described by some as a state-within-a-state, boasting control of one fifth of global gas reserves.",
  "Gazprom may be a private company, but its ties to the Russian government make it the perfect instrument for political intervention in the energy arena.",
  "The risk of multinational oil companies eroding the sovereignty of a weak state is a threat also faced by Iraq (where Gazprom also operates).",
  "Since their inception, the Oil Police have struggled with defending infrastructure from attack, citing poor training and a lack of resources.",
  "Moscow remains unafraid of sanctions against Assad's regime while Putin himself faces similar restrictions by Western leaders.",
  "The Iraq War saw the use of commercial military forces — mercenaries — to an extensive degree unprecedented in the modern era.",
  "And the proximity to China as a market is especially attractive at a time when Sino-Russian relations are blossoming.",
  "A new sheriff\n\nMany Russian energy giants are itching to return to Syria as the likelihood of stability increases.",
  "Energy giants like Gazprom (who are rumoured to have pushed for the legislation) will be armed and ready.",
  "Anyone courting Syrian energy will be expected to flatter Putin the oil Tsar as much as Assad himself.",
  "The prolonged presence of Russian workers would easily justify military precautions by the Kremlin.",
  "In exchange, Russia will have a stronger presence in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean.",
  "A former farmer works at a primitive refinery as he makes crude oil into diesel and other products.",
  "For Assad, Russia remains his strongest supporter and a key reason he has clung to his iron throne.",
  "Hussein Malla/AP Photo Before the civil war, Syria produced over 400,000 barrels of oil per day.",
  "Thanks to the 2007 law, such precautions can be taken by the companies themselves.",
  "In a sense, Russia is the perfect candidate to monopolise such an offer.",
  "Gazprom is well-placed to represent Russia's expansion into Syria.",
  "Perhaps this complication will erode Syria's stability further.",
