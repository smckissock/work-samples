  "Candidly this makes me want to puke #JaredsIdea pic.twitter.com/tAeEWUXfI1 — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) May 20, 2017\n\nStone's CV was compelling enough to inspire a recently released Netflix documentary, \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" chronicling his life in national politics -- one that began as a young dirty trickster for Nixon, endured a scandalous setback in the mid 1990s and reemerged in the last two decades as, among other things, a voice directing Trump toward the presidential trough.",
  "If Kushner is the young, buttoned-down and stiff-lipped operator in Trump's inner orbit, then Stone is the bullish and flamboyant right-wing gadfly, always a phone call away from Trump or anyone else who wants to talk, and a résumé that dates back to the Nixon years.",
  "(CNN) As images of President Donald Trump leaning in to receive a glittering gift from King Salman bin Abdulaziz made the rounds this weekend, a longtime personal confidante of the President felt sick.",
  "\"Candidly this makes me want to puke,\" Roger Stone tweeted on Saturday , a picture of Trump being awarded a mark of the kingdom's highest civilian honor above his words.",
  "Appended there: #Jaredsidea -- a reference to the President's son-in-law and top White House aide Jared Kushner.",
  "\"I was like a jockey looking for a horse,\" Stone says in the film.",
  "(Trump's) a prime piece of political horse flesh in my view.\"",
  "\"You can't win the race if you don't have a horse."
