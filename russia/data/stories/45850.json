  "Don MacAskill, CEO of Smugmug (Photo: Christopher Prentiss Michel)\n\nAnd, in an industry that dangles free services to suck up people’s personal information to target ads, SmugMug has catered to people who are willing to pay for privacy and storage, offering four levels of subscriptions to appeal to everyday shutterbugs and professional photographers alike.",
