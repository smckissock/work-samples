  "And so, we have a lot of hard work to do and I have a lot of hard work to do but it's work I take super seriously and really believe in and want to do because I think at the end of the day, so much good happens on Facebook and we have to protect against the bad and do much more there and that's what we're doing.",
  "In her first interview since the story was published, Sandberg told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell she did not know about an effort described by the Times to publish stories critical of other tech companies, an apparent attempt to deflect attention away from Facebook.",
  "What we haven't done and we're not gonna do is Mark and I are not gonna hold up other people out and say that person is a problem and they're gone because we think we should hold ourselves accountable and that's not the way to run a company and not the way to lead.",
  "We're working closely with government, we are systematically finding foreign interference from Iran, reportedly from Russia, from spammers and we are systematically taking it down, notifying and working with law enforcement, working with other companies.",
  "O'DONNELL: I just want to make sure I'm clear about this, because I think that the reason that there was such a response to this article is the suggestion that Facebook itself is involved in information warfare against its critics...\n\nSANDBERG: Correct.",
  "O'DONNELL: But that's the charge, Sheryl, is that every time you're presented with a problem and people ask for transparency or an independent investigation Facebook deflects and says, \"Well, we'll look into it,\" that the company is not transparent.",
  "It has been lightly edited for clarity:\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL, \"CBS THIS MORNING\" CO-HOST: The New York Times published an article this week which said you and Mark Zuckerberg \"Ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from the public view.\"",
  "And it matters, because this impacts people's lives, it impacts elections, and so my job is to make sure we're making the best possible investments we can, and making the investments we need to make sure we can prevent abuse as much as possible.",
  "If you're going to have a platform that billions of people use, you're going to see all the ugliness and all the beauty and I think we were not focused enough on preventing some of the bad things that can be happen on Facebook.",
  "O'DONNELL: I don't have to remind you about Burson-Marsteller in 2011 when you hired them to get misleading and negative stories about Google into mainstream media outlets, and then apologized when you were caught.",
  "SANDBERG: Looking at, looking at all the firms we use and what they do and what we hired them for\n\nO'DONNELL: If you didn't hire Definers and didn't know what they were doing on behalf of Facebook, who did?",
  "The Times also reported that the firm tried to tie critics of Facebook to George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist – and frequent target of conservative anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.",
  "O'DONNELL: A group of senators Thursday asked the justice department to expand their ongoing investigations into Facebook to include claims that the company retaliated against critics.",
  "And I have a really important job, it's a job I love and a job I'm honored to do and I think a really deep responsibility to Mark and to the company to help get us into a better place.",
  "that when these problems came to the forefront, that you organized a strategy – not to fix the problem – but to deny, deflect and minimize them in practices that are being criticized.",
  "We know we have a long road ahead and we don't expect it to happen overnight and we don't expect an easy fix but we know we have a long road over head and we are absolutely committed.",
  "A day after a searing investigation into Facebook by The New York Times, the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is defending herself and the social media giant.",
  "We are making major investments that we should have made earlier to fix those issues and the reason I think we can do it is because we built the company, we care the most.",
  "But we didn't see this kind of new, insidious attack, which was very different than anyone had seen before, which was using disinformation to spread dissent in society.",
  "And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false.",
  "And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false.",
  "I feel a tremendous responsibility to get us focused on that and make sure that we're building both the defenses we need to have and the products we need to have.",
  "O'DONNELL: What the New York Times is reporting is that some of those defenses include what are essentially efforts to deny, deflect and minimize these problems.",
  "But suggesting that we weren't interested in knowing the truth -- or that once we understood it and we didn't go after it aggressively is completely not true.",
  "I did not make the decision not to put Russia in the thing but in a footnote, but they did put it in the footnote in the end and talk about it broadly.",
  "And, our core strategy has been to find the problems, make sure we are investing in prevention and make sure we are fixing the mistakes that we made.",
  "But I will say that if there was anything that you know inadvertently or advertently played into any anti-Semitic attacks on anyone that's a problem.",
  "The campaign was reportedly orchestrated by the consulting firm Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research group hired by Facebook.",
  "The Times said Sandberg tried to rein in Facebook's then-security chief, Alex Stamos, who had been looking into Russian activity on the network.",
  "O'DONNELL: ...and that you have led that effort, because you are focused on protecting your reputation rather than the future of the company.",
  "The Times noted that one white paper Facebook released, based on an internal investigation by Stamos, did not include the word Russia.",
  "Among the claims: Facebook attempted to downplay the significance of Russian activity in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.",
  "Our strategy is to find the issues, invest in security, shore up security on Facebook, and make everyone stay safe in our community.",
  "We know how this works and we know what we need to do to make sure we get to a place where we are protecting safety and security.",
  "We move people out of the company, we move people into the company, we change jobs, we actually are quite rigorous on this.",
  "O'DONNELL: How can we trust Facebook to police fake news when it paid a company millions of dollars to create \"fake news?\"",
  "We got the independent investigation done and we released it last week so I don't think it's fair to say we don't do that.",
  "We've invested a ton in AI and technology and if you were following us before the election, you saw those efforts pay off.",
  "The Times report was published with the headline, \"Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook's leaders fought through crisis.\"",
  "We've invested a ton in AI and technology and if you were following us before the election you saw those efforts pay off.",
  "SANDBERG: I mean I don't know what that investigation is but we cooperate fully in any investigation from the government.",
  "When you look at fake accounts, all of the Russian interference we failed to see in 2016 was coming from fake accounts.",
  "Sandberg said the firm was hired by \"the communications team\" and that she only learned about its work from the paper.",
  "SANDBERG: That's absolutely not true and there's just an enormous number of things in that article - that's not true.",
  "\"It was not what I was doing nor was it the company's strategy to deflect, to deny or to hire PR firms to do things.",
  "It was not what I was doing nor was it the company's strategy to deflect, to deny or to hire PR firms to do things.",
  "\"Our strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\" Sandberg told O'Donnell.",
  "When you think about fake news on Facebook, we've invested in third party relationships, the ability to downrank.",
  "And we had some issues with privacy along with Cambridge Analytica and some of the development platforms we had.",
  "So we've said before that on spotting Russian interference that happened in the 2016 election we were too slow.",
  "We've taken enormous steps to become experts in fighting this and now you can see us actively pulling it down.",
  "SANDBERG: Yes\n\nO'DONNELL: And do you think you have the confidence of the rank-and-file employees at Facebook?",
  "SANDBERG: We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news - THAT they have assured me was not happening.",
  "Here's what I would say, Norah, is that the allegations in this piece are very serious and absolutely false.",
  "O'DONNELL: Shouldn't the Chief Operating Officer know if the company was hiring an opposition research firm?",
  "I think if you look at the track record from the 2016 election to this one you see, the work is never done.",
  "We were able to take down lots of stuff over and over, over and over because we were now focused on this.\"",
  "We were able to take down lots of stuff over and over, over and over because we were now focused on this.",
  "O'DONNELL: What are you doing to make sure that you aren't employing another type of Definers-type firm?",
  "We announced today that we're going to have an independent board looking at appeals for content review.",
  "And I hope, over time, that we will be judged by the actions we've taken and the progress we're making.",
  "The article saying that I was spending time hiding, deflecting or hiring PR firms to do other things.",
  "I have a big responsibility here, I have a big responsibility for the challenges we're dealing with.",
  "\"We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news – that they have assured me was not happening.",
  "We missed some really important things and I don't think we invested enough in safety and security.",
  "O'DONNELL: Personally - how does it make you feel, having these charges leveled against you today?",
  "But now we've taken great steps, we've made huge investments, we have 10,000 people in security.",
  "O'DONNELL: Well George Soros is now calling for Facebook to have an independent investigation.",
  "We're a big company, we're using a lot of agencies and we're taking a very, very careful look.",
  "The form of that investigation I don't know but I am aggressively looking into what happened.",
  "SANDBERG: I feel the need to do this job and help lead Facebook through the period we're in.",
  "We just released an independent investigation that we had commissioned on Myanmar last week.",
  "And we're dealing with unbelievably challenging issues that have taken place on a new scale.",
  "Our core strategy has been to shore up the defenses to the company and invest in security.",
  "Our strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there.",
  "So on the elections, we were way behind in 2016 and we didn't see this threat coming.",
  "I wasn't involved in any of that and I don't think that was the core strategy at all.",
  "We were focused on traditional attacks from Russia, you know, think hacking, malware.",
  "But, you should know that we take this seriously and we do make employee movements.",
  "SANDBERG: I think we should have learned to be more careful in the agencies we use.",
  "On us to figure out what those are, we get ahead of them and even anticipate them.",
  "We're actually looking very carefully at all the firms we use now as part of this.",
  "But this article, it paints you as \"unaware\" of what was happening in the company.",
  "In the interview Thursday, Sandberg stressed Facebook's new efforts at security.",
  "I think we've taken major steps with transparency and that's really important.",
  "We were focused on a different kind of interference that was more traditional.",
  "We actually have, in progress, many of the things people have asked us to do.",
  "SANDBERG: I certainly wish if this was going on, that I had known about it.",
  "We are always going to have someone trying to use our services in bad ways.",
  "I also want to acknowledge, Norah, that trust takes a long time to rebuild.",
  "SANDBERG: I mean, of course it's hard, but I don't think that's the point.",
  "O'DONNELL: Do you believe that you have the confidence of Mark Zuckerberg?",
  "And it was unsparing in its criticism of Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "SANDBERG: Norah, here's the thing: We take performance really seriously.",
  "O'DONNELL: But George Soros is calling for an independent investigation.",
  "O'DONNELL: You're often referred to as Facebook's \"adult in the room.\"",
  "SANDBERG: I mean, never paid for anyone to do anything that was wrong.",
  "When asked if she has the confidence of the rank-and-file employees?",
  "We saw that and we took it down and reported it to law enforcement.",
  "Not just for the U.S. election but for elections around the world.",
  "We didn't know about foreign interference in 2016 but now we know.",
  "I never paid for fake news, we're looking into what Definers did.",
  "I never told Alex Stamos it was a legal problem to investigate.",
  "I learned of that in the paper yesterday as well when Mark did.",
  "The following is the extended Q&A with O'Donnell and Sandberg.",
  "And they're gone and we're looking into what happened there.",
  "A later blog post by Facebook also downplayed Russia's role.",
  "We've made huge investments in taking down fake accounts.",
  "He has tweeted on that multiple times, including today.",
  "SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER: No.",
  "SANDBERG: I don't have full details and they are gone.",
  "Not to get any articles written or do anything false.",
  "We've taken great steps, we've made huge investments.",
  "I was not part of the discussions on the white paper.",
  "O'DONNELL: So if you've not led that effort, who has?",
  "We missed foreign interference in the 2016 election.",
  "Sandberg says she has the confidence of Zuckerberg.",
  "And I think we're making very substantial progress.",
  "I did not know about or hire Definers or any firm.",
  "And as we've said before, you know, that's on us.",

  "We have an election commission coming out.",

  "O'DONNELL: Do you really want to say that?",
  "And that's very important,\" Sandberg said.",
  "SANDBERG: No, everything there was false.",
  "Did you learn anything from that episode?",
  "Will you cooperate in that investigation?",

  "Because that's not what we're doing.",
  "The ability to do related articles.",
  "We missed really important things.",
  "SANDBERG: The communications team.",

  "Is that a fair characterization?",
  "And I was part of none of that.",
  "And I was part of none of that.",
  "Mark has said he missed things.",
  "But you see major improvements.",
  "That's what Definers was doing.",
  "That is not what we are doing.",
  "We'll always cooperate fully.",
  "Is Facebook considering that?",
  "SANDBERG: Yes, I believe so.",
  "I have not led that effort.",
  "And that's very important.",
  "I don't have full details.",
  "That's just all not true.",
  "We will always cooperate.",
  "That is not the strategy.",
  "That is not the strategy.",
  "That's not the strategy.",
  "That's not the strategy.",
  "So I'm looking into it.",
  "O'DONNELL: Was it spin?",
  "I certainly wish I had.",
