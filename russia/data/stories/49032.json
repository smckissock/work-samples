  "Here’s the question that all of us got to answer: What do we tell our constituents, given what’s happened here, why we should let you self-regulate?",
  "Mark Zuckerberg\n\nI think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people’s lives, is what’s the right regulation?",

  "But he didn’t say there are other companies that make the same product, so to speak.",
  "If I’m upset with Facebook, what’s the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?",
