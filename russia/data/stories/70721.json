  "RT soon shifted its editorial approach, forgetting about early features on life across the vast expanse of Russia, broadcasting a steady stream of \"alternative\" news reports, heavy on conspiracy theories, criticism of the American government's \"oppressive\" domestic and international policies, and a steady stream of \"what-about-ism,\" a time-worn propaganda technique used by the Soviet government in which criticism is deflected by cries of \"but what about?...\"",
  "The TV cameras, broadcasting the celebration live, panned the audience, lingering on young, bright faces, then focused on the Russian Presidential standard, the czarist double-headed eagle on a field of white, blue and red, unfurling in the chill breeze\n\nOn a red, white and blue heart projected on a giant video monitor at the back of the stage the words \"Crimea is in my heart!\"",
  "At the same time, Zygar' says, Mironyuk was close - initially - to some influential Kremlin figures, allies of President Putin, men like his First Deputy Chief of Staff Alexey Gromov; Mikhail Lesin, adviser to Putin and his former media official credited with creating Russia's international TV network RT; and Putin's senior aide Vladislav Surkov.",
  "In December, reporting from Kiev for Russia's government-owned Russia One television channel, Kiselev decried the anti-Yanukovich protests as a Western-fuelled and funded plot, reminding his viewers in March that \"Russia is the only country in the world realistically capable of turning the United States into radioactive ash.\"",
  "Kiselev also was toeing the line on the Russian government's increasingly strident tone on \"depraved\" Western values like gay rights, at one point saying \"fining gays is not sufficient - they should not be allowed to give blood, or sperm and in case of a car accident, their hearts should be burnt or buried as useless\".",
  "\"Such questions and statements,\" Roskomnadzor said, \"could be interpreted as insulting to veterans of the Great War of the Fatherland (the term many Russians use for World War II) and to residents of Leningrad during the Blockade, who exerted all their efforts to achieve victory in the battle with Nazi Germany.\"",
  "One Russian TV journalist, requesting his name not be used because of the political sensitivity of the issue, told me it's not so much an issue of being pro-Kremlin or anti-Kremlin; Mironyuk, he says, \"was a kind of liberal Kremlin media manager and that liberal clan has been defeated, and defeated with blood.",

  "His litany included Yugoslavia in 1999 and the Western bombing of Belgrade; the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan; the \"color\" revolution in Ukraine and Georgia; the \"chaos\" of the Arab Spring; the United States' missile defense system: \"We understand what is happening,\" Putin said.",
  "In mid-February President Putin awarded Kiselev the Order for Service to the Fatherland Fourth Class for \"many years of diligent work,\" as well as \"services in the humanitarian sphere, strengthening the rules of law,\" and \"protection of the rights and interests of citizens.\"",
  "Mironyuk said she was protecting her \"historic responsibility\" as the editor who had served longer than anyone else in her position, among those who, during Soviet times, \"were shot, who were put in prison, who are now retired...I am just sorry that it is ending with me.\"",

  "On March 12, on the Lenta.ru website, 69 staff members published an open letter protesting the firing of an independent editor and the replacement of her with one \"directly controlled from offices of the Kremlin\" was a violation of Russia's media law.",
  "A few hours after getting the news, Mironyuk sat on a stage at RIA-Novosti's headquarters in downtown Moscow, looking out at her shell-shocked journalists, many of whom had fled from other Russian media outlets under pressure from the Kremlin.",

  "\"The person who has recently been put at the head of a new propaganda agency causes an allergic reaction in Kiev,\" the reporter said, \"precisely because they consider Russia's information campaign regarding their country as hostile.\"",

  "The interview contained a link to the group's leader, Dmitriy Yarosh, whom the Russian government put on an international wanted list, accusing him of fighting against Russian soldiers in Chechnya and inciting terrorism.",
  "In the early days of post-Soviet Russia Kiselev was an aggressive, liberal journalist but, as a friend and fellow journalist described him to me this month, at heart he is an \"opportunist,\" a man \"without principles.\"",
  "Last December, explaining why he was offering a loan to cash-strapped Ukraine, Putin told reporters: \"I'll tell seriously without any irony: we often use the phrase 'brotherly country' and 'brotherly people.'\"",
  "RIA Novosti, he says, was in the midst of a hiring spree just before President Putin's order, offering high salaries and poaching Russian and English-speaking journalists across the spectrum in Moscow.",
