  "The President previously stated in a tweet “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?",

  "This information comes from five sources who claim to have discussed the situation with President Trump, “He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source said.",
