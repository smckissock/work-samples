  "Regulators could take notice now, as they did with Uber when the company revealed a security breach that it tried to cover up with large payments in the name of a \"bug bounty\" to hackers who found the data.",

  "But it will face far more stringent oversight by both the public and possibly government agencies who view anything less than total transparency with greater skepticism than ever.",
  "Not long ago, few companies would dream of having to come out publicly to tell customers their data had possibly been exposed but had not been stolen or misused.",

  "Meanwhile, Facebook has faced questions about its data handling that, before the Cambridge Analytica Scandal, would have seemed like a distant problem.",
  "And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have had to testify to Congress about its practices handling user data.",
  "The company has paid $148 million in settlements because of this incident, which was relatively minor except for the cover-up.",
