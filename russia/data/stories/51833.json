  "The Venom vulnerability, as dubbed by security intelligence firm CrowdStrike after Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations Manipulation, resided in the virtual floppy drive code used by many computer virtualization platforms and therefore by many cloud providers, possibly including Amazon, though an advisory said its customers were not affected, as well as Oracle , Citrix and Rackspace.",
  "Providers need to be aware of all the code they have inherited, given the flawed software was released 11 years ago, and users might want to consider paying extra to separate their virtual machines from others to avoid such issues in the future, warning that attackers wanting to exploit Venom could just buy their way to the root privileges required.",
  "Venom is an interesting bug, though not unprecedented and no exploits have been seen in the wild, neither have any guest-to-host escapes against a provider been seen before, noted Zach Lanier, researcher at security provider Accuvant Labs, who only gave it a \"moderate\" severity rating.",
  "As various hypervisors, including Amazon and Citrix favourite Xen, and KVM, the default hypervisor in widely-deployed OpenStack clouds, such as those run by HP and Rackspace, incorporated that QEMU code, they may have been left vulnerable.",
  "The vulnerability, warned CrowdStrike , allowed for anyone with root access (the most privileged level of access on a server or client computer) on a virtual machine to reach out of that VM and into others sharing the same hypervisor.",
  "Kaminsky noted the “long tail” of problems associated with Heartbleed, a bug which affected a large number of websites due to the widespread use of the broken encryption library OpenSSL, won’t be seen with Venom.",
  "A Rackspace spokesperson said: \"Regarding VENOM specifically, earlier this week, Rackspace was notified of a potential hypervisor vulnerability that affects a portion of our Cloud Servers fleet.",
  "But CrowdStrike and partners, including noted security expert and co-founder of White Ops Dan Kaminsky, organised a disclosure process that has led to patches rolling out today.",
  "In theory, criminal hackers could have bought space on cloud servers run by those companies, exploited Venom and started poking around other people’s rented space.",
  "Everyone affected should patch as soon as possible, given the high chance of a public exploit being released soon, added Tod Beardsley, research manager at Rapid7.",
  "That’s because “95 per cent of the risk” is held by the various cloud and virtual private server (VPS) providers affected who will likely act fast.",
  "The hypervisor controls virtual machines, which provide the computing resources individuals and businesses rent or buy from cloud providers.",
  "Both the QEMU Project and the Xen Project delivered their anti-Venom code today, whilst ZDNet has reported an Oracle patch was coming.",
  "That would indicate other OpenStack partners are affected, though HP had responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.",
  "“This circumstance leads me to believe that VENOM is an \"interesting\" bug to the sorts of people who do exploit research for a living.",
  "Open source giant Red Hat issued an advisory guiding users to the fixes, noting its OpenStack and Enterprise offerings were affected.",
  "Given this incentive of interestingness, I would expect to see a public proof of concept exploit appear sooner rather than later.”",
  "We have applied the appropriate patch to our infrastructure and are working with customers to fully remediate this vulnerability.\"",
  "To be able to break out of a guest OS to a host OS is a rare and powerful ability, and such bugs are uncommon.",
  "It has a more terrifying name than Heartbleed, but don’t panic, it’s not going to cause as much trouble.",
  "The flawed code stems back to the Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) in QEMU, an open source hypervisor.",
  "But the ultimate message here is for cloud providers and users, Kaminsky told FORBES.",
  "It would, if it had ever occurred, amounted to a cloud-based nightmare.",
  "Such virtual machine escapes have been demonstrated before.",
  "Citrix said it was looking into the issue."
