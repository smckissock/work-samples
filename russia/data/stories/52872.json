  "While much about Russia’s cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, details of the government’s effort to recruit programmers in recent years — whether professionals like Mr. Vyarya, college students, or even criminals — are shedding some light on the Kremlin’s plan to create elite teams of computer hackers.",
  "Under a new doctrine, the nation’s generals were redefining war as more than a contest of steel and gunpowder, making cyberwarfare a central tenet in expanding the Kremlin’s interests.",
  "Mr. Vyarya, 33, a bearded, bespectacled computer programmer who thwarted hackers, said he was suddenly being asked to join a sweeping overhaul of the Russian military last year.",
  "MOSCOW — Aleksandr B. Vyarya thought his job was to defend people from cyberattacks — until, he says, his government approached him with a request to do the opposite.",
  "But Mr. Vyarya was worried about the consequences of his refusal, so he abruptly fled to Finland last year, he and his former employer said.",
  "“Sorry, I can’t,” Mr. Vyarya said he told an executive at a Russian military contracting firm who had offered him the hacking job.",
  "It was a rare example of a Russian who sought asylum in the face of the country’s push to recruit hackers.",
  "“This is against my principles — and illegal,” he said of the Russian military’s hacking effort."
