  "When asked why Walgreens does not explicitly inform customers at purchase time that their prescription may be used to target them for medical trials and offer them the ability to opt-out of having their private medical information used in such a manner, the company did not respond, instead offering that once a customer receives a targeting mailing, the letter will include a toll-free number they can use to opt out of future mailings.",
  "I reached out to one vendor that uses data from some of the same brokers as Facebook and offers a list of 4.5 million names of “donors to charitable causes that have self-reported ailment concerns, purchased related health products and/or subscribed to related publications” and asked how it ensures the accuracy of its products and any specific restrictions it places on those that purchase its list.",
  "When asked whether the company clearly states to each customer that their prescription information can be used by it to send them mailings targeting their disease on behalf of other companies and whether it collects informed consent for the mailings, the company responded that “recruitment letters for certain, approved clinical research studies are allowed under HIPAA provisions.",
  "It also did not respond to a request for comment on whether, in light of the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica story and the broader societal reckoning it has spawned regarding privacy, whether it would reconsider the program or switch to an opt-in program that requires customers to explicitly decide to participate, rather than silently enroll every customer in its program.",
  "The company emphasized that privacy and protection of customer medical information was paramount and that the third party companies themselves never receive any patient information, they simply pay a fee to Walgreens and ask it to send mailers on their behalf to all of its customers that have filled prescriptions for certain drugs at its stores.",
  "A Walgreen spokesperson confirmed that the company uses a provision of HIPAA to “work with third-party clinical research companies as well as with pharmaceutical manufacturers on clinical trial studies” to send mailers on their behalf to its customers that have filled prescriptions at its pharmacies.",
  "In a world in which our most intimate medical ailments are merely commodity data points to be bought and sold about us, making money for everyone but us, is the Facebook story really the most important one or should we be talking about just how many companies today \"own\" our digitized selves?",
  "For example, did you know that if you fill a drug prescription at Walgreens, the company has the right to commercialize your medical information by charging clinical research companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers to send mailers to you on their behalf based on your medical condition?",
  "On the other hand, you’re likely to research that rash, fill a prescription for it, subscribe to mailing lists and magazines if it is a symptom of a chronic disease and take other actions that the data brokerage industry will capture and commercialize without you ever being aware.",
  "Perhaps most tellingly, when asked last year whether Facebook would commit as a matter of corporate principle that it would never permit advertisers to begin targeting its two billion users based on their medical and mental health histories, the company declined to do so.",
  "When asked how it reconciled its official guidelines with leaked reports of secret internal research that would permit advertisers to target young children suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts and other mental health conditions, the company declined to comment.",
  "Instead, if you used a Walgreens pharmacy and there is a medical research or pharmaceutical company interested in your condition, you might start receiving mailers asking you to sign up for their clinical trials and it is all completely legal.",
  "If you wake up one morning with a rash on your buttocks, your first reaction is probably not going to be to post a photograph of it on Facebook and describe its appearance and symptoms in nauseating detail to all your friends and followers.",
  "The central thesis of the Cambridge Analytica story was that our Facebook data so strongly reflects our psychological characteristics that it can be used to develop models that can sway us towards or against a certain viewpoint.",
  "Yet, they have been largely absent from the societal conversation of the last few weeks about the privacy of our data and our rights (or lack thereof) to control what companies are allowed to access and do with our information.",
  "Even if you’ve never stepped foot in Facebook’s walled garden or know anyone who has, there are myriad companies out there that are buying and selling your information every day that you likely had no idea existed.",
  "Lost in all of the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica hyperbole of the past few weeks is any kind of broader privacy conversation about the vast world of data brokers that buy and sell our most intimate information.",
  "Putting this all together, Facebook knows the perfect airbrushed you that exists only in fantasy – it is the data brokers and data repurposers like Walgreens that know the real you behind closed doors.",
  "Until last week, Facebook actually purchased data from a number of third party data brokers, including those that offer data points for targeting advertisements to specific medical conditions.",
  "The company also did not respond to requests for comment regarding the number of mailers it has sent out, the number of recipients or the total payment it has received for this service.",
  "Even though the companies don’t receive your name and address from Walgreens, they are able to use Walgreens as essentially a targeted medical advertising platform for clinical trials.",
  "For example, whether it explicitly prohibits companies from purchasing its lists to screen their employees or employment prospects to identify those that may have particular ailments.",
  "When you fill a doctor’s prescription at your local pharmacy in the US, you likely believe that medical privacy laws prohibit it from commercializing your medical misfortune.",
  "Or that there is an entire industry of companies that sell mailing lists of people with every imaginable disease, all available for pennies per name, monetizing your misery?",
  "The company refused to provide an on-the-record response to any of the questions I posed, reflecting just how hard it can be to learn anything about the secretive industry.",
  "Facebook itself has historically officially prohibited advertisers from targeting specific medical conditions or mental health.",
  "At the same time, far more sensitive and intrusive medical information is not necessarily as well reflected on Facebook.",
  "These communications typically don’t require patient authorization” and pointed to HHS’s HIPAA guidance and its own FAQ.",
  "Facebook tends to be the place we present a highly curated utopian portrait of our perfect selves.",
  "It is at best unclear the degree to which Facebook data is actually that powerful."
