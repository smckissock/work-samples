  "Here are total returns for the 15 stocks going back three years, as well as returns from the end of the quarter when SQ Advisors either initially purchased the shares, according to FactSet, or the fourth quarter of 2011, after which the firm began filing lists of its stock holdings with the SEC:\n\nThe firm reports its stock holdings as of the end of each quarter, So the returns in the right-most column do not incorporate any additional purchases or any sales since that date.",
  "Here are the 15 stocks held by the SQ Advisors as of March 31, along with their five-year average ROCC compared with those of their industry competitors:\n\nROCC calculations aren’t available for Brookfield Asset Management because it is registered in Canada and does not file standard 10-K annual reports with the SEC,.",
  "The Shareholder Forum has developed a similar but uniform measure, return on corporate capital (ROCC), that allows for a quick and free comparison of a company’s numbers to those of its competitors, based the company’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which comes from SEC filings.",
  "Simpson, a former CEO of Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A, -1.39% BRK.B, -1.48% Geico insurance unit and now chairman of SQ Advisors, has said he looks for a high rate of return on invested capital, along with a high cash-flow return and a relatively low ratio of price to cash flow.",
  "Return on equity (ROE) only measures operating earnings against how much its shareholders have invested, while return on invested capital (ROIC) measures operating earnings against a company’s equity and long-term debt — pretty much all the money invested in it.",
  "At a time when value investing has been out of style and the S&P 500’s performance has been driven by technology plays, particularly the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Nextflix and Google parent Alphabet) Simpson’s investments have done well.",
  "The bottom line\n\nThe data tell us two things: Simpson is looking out several years for many of these companies, and subjective analysis of a company’s competitiveness and current investments is critical to his successful investing style.",
  "The S&P 500 SPX, -2.33% has a weighted ratio of price to free cash flow of 20.4 (excluding companies with negative cash flow), based on the closing share price on June 8 and data for the past 12 reported months, according to FactSet.",
  "In contrast, Wall Street analysts and the financial media are much more focused on quarterly and annual results — and Wall Street’s one-year horizon really is a short period for a serious long-term investor.",
  "ROCC is a company’s annual net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt.",
  "Price to free cash flow\n\nA look at valuations relative to free cash flow may paint a different value picture for the companies whose ROCC came in below those of their competitors.",
  "So here are ratings summaries and price targets for the 15 stocks:\n\nIt’s not surprising that the analysts’ ratings lean positive, because that is how the industry is geared.",
  "Some can be judged by the numbers, but the rest relies on a more subjective analysis of a company’s position relative to peers and to the opportunities in its industry.",
  "Apple AAPL, -3.57% Cable One CABO, -0.88% Tyler Technologies TYL, -1.74% and Berkshire Hathaway have greatly outperformed their competitors on this basis.",
  "Out of the 14 companies for which the calculations are available, only eight have five-year average ROCC that are higher than those of their competitors.",
  "Two — Charles Schwab SCHW, -2.65% and Liberty Broadband LBRDK, -2.46% — have also had negative free cash flow for the most recent reported quarters.",
  "This indicates heavy investment by these companies, and Simpson’s stakes suggest confidence that the investments will pay off over the long term.",
  "For Simpson, value means a company with a track record for good financial performance, along with a relatively low price and low risk.",
  "Instead, a calculation is made for the aggregated assets and income data for the entire SIC group, excluding for the subject company.",
  "In fact, a recent look at the S&P 500 showed that there were no companies with majority ‘sell’ or equivalent ratings among analysts.",
  "About half of SQ’s 15 stocks top that, as this table shows:\n\nThree have negative total free cash flow over the past 12 months.",
  "Return on corporate capital\n\nThere are various ways to measure a company’s return on the money that has been invested in it.",
  "Don’t miss: Stocks for an anti-FAANG portfolio\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 22% in 2017; eight of his plays did as well or better.",
  "So what can investors learn through a closer look at Simpson’s current holdings, as disclosed in regulatory filings?",
  "The idea is a measure how well a company’s management deploys capital for the production of goods and services.",
  "It is money that can be used for expansion, acquisitions, dividends, buybacks or other corporate purposes.",
  "Wall Street sentiment\n\nOne thing Simpson assuredly does not rely on is the opinion of sell-side analysts.",
  "One of the laggards, CarMax, is a 2018 acquisition, and two others were bought toward the end of 2017.",
  "ROCC is most meaningful within industries, because some are much more capital intensive than others.",
  "Stocks ratings from analysts who provide reports to brokerage customers skew toward the positive.",
  "It is calculated annually for all publicly traded companies in the U.S. based on annual reports.",
  "The price targets are for 12 months, which no doubt is considered a short period by Simpson.",
  "A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures.",
  "This means that the industry ROCCs for two companies in the same group may be different.",
  "But it’s still worth looking at which stocks are being pumped the most by analysts.",
  "The idea is to understand how good a company’s managers are at deploying capital.",
  "Lou Simpson is a veteran value investor tremendously admired by Warren Buffett.",
  "A company’s ROCC is not simply compared to the average ROCC for its SIC group.",
  "You can do you own comparisons for free at the Shareholder Forum’s website.",
  "We also don’t know if SQ Advisors has sold any shares since March 31.",
  "Here’s a deeper look at those stocks using some of his criteria.",
  "For three years through June 8, the S&P’s return was 34%.",
  "As of March 31, SQ Advisors held 15 stocks.",
  "But methods of calculating ROIC vary."
