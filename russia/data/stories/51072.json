  "The Washington Post started a new anti-Trump firestorm late Monday when it reported that President Trump revealed highly classified information on terrorist threats from ISIS in Syria to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak.",
  "It’s about time the mainstream media and congressional Democrats start focusing on the dangers of such leaks to our security and system of government instead of just using them to advance their political agenda against President Trump.",
  "As a result, he was thrown off the Senate Intelligence Committee and earned the nickname “Leaky Leahy.”\n\nFurthermore, under U.S. law, the President of the United States is our nation’s ultimate classification authority.",
  "The Post claims it did not reveal all the details of the disclosures from its sources because U.S. officials said this would “jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.”\n\nYes, there’s a scandal here.",
  "We do know that current U.S. officials -- possibly with the NSC and intelligence agencies -- originated this story and revealed highly classified intelligence to the Post as part of their leaks.",
  "The Obama White House also reportedly revealed sensitive intelligence to the media concerning the Stuxnet virus to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program and details of the Usama bin Laden raid.",

  "It is urgent that the Trump administration bring in new blood to replace hundreds of Obama loyalists placed in key positions throughout the government by the last administration.",
  "We don’t know if these sources lied, misrepresented what went on in the Trump meeting with the Russians, or were second-guessing what Trump told them.",

  "Senator Dianne Feinstein accidently leaked classified sensitive information on drone strikes in 2009 during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
  "For example, in 2014, the Obama White House accidently revealed the name of the CIA Station Chief in Afghanistan to the press.",
  "Major house cleanings at the NSC, CIA, ODNI and the State Department to address this serious security threat are long overdue.",
  "And of course there is Senator Patrick Leahy who deliberately leaked classified information to hurt President Reagan in 1987.",
  "The real scandal here concerns the current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Washington Post to generate this story.",
  "It concerns former and current U.S. officials leaking classified information to the press to undermine a U.S. president.",
  "The leaks also are another indication of the serious problem the Trump administration continues to face with leakers.",
