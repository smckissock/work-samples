  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The question, I think, really has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views but doesn't lead to a Balkanization of our society but rather, continues to promote ways of finding common ground?",
  "The\n\n\n\nidea is if they can nick away at the credibility of a trusted organization like the FBI, which is intimately involved obviously in the Mueller investigation, that when findings are presented that they don't agree with or that they think are politically damaging, they have called into question the very foundation of those findings.",
  "You have a senior administration official telling us, CNN, that the Trump administration has decided to be more quiet, to be more discreet, as that official put it, about speaking publicly about U.S. military exercises with South Korea and Japan that are aimed at demonstrating military capability against North Korea.",
  "It's this idea that, if there are things that come out of this investigation that they do not like, things that make the party or the president of the United States or the party look bad, they can point and say, you know, \"Look, there are these anti-Trump text messages among people in the FBI.",
  "I'm not maybe the most nuanced political person in the world coming from a career in business, but I'm pretty frustrated that all the things that have come out by the -- Strzok and Orr and what may or may not have taken place in Deputy General's...\n\n\n\nKEILAR: But -- let me stop you there.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[17:30:00] KEILAR: A Florida Republican congressman says his use of the word \"purge\" may have been pretty strong, but Congressman Francis Rooney tells me he still thinks the FBI and Justice Department should get rid of employee who are politically compromised.",
  "The most recent thing that the Russians are saying comes from the chief of staff from the Russian military, Valery Gerasimov, and he accuses the U.S. of training fighters at Al-Tanf, which is a small outpost where the U.S. does have a presence, where it is training some forces.",
  "KHANNA: I'm not convinced necessarily that it can stop them, but it certainly, if we look at the example of the 1990s and the Clinton administration, it can delay the development and the nuclear weapons; and it can deter them from using those weapons against the United States.",
  "But one thing I would point out is that the people most affected by this, South Korea, the president of South Korea believes we should engage in direct talks and the representative of Guam, whose people face a direct threat, also believes that we should engage in direct talks.",
  "JAMES GAGLIANO, FORMER SPECIAL AGENT, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: My concern are softer targets and, obviously, things that North Korea might do to provoke the South Koreans, to attempt to cause either the games being shut down or events being moved or potentially war.",

  "PATRICK CRONIN, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY PROGRAM, CENTER FOR A NEW AMERICAN SECURITY: He is facing the prospect of two years of maximum economic strangulation through sanctions and other law enforcement measures to really cripple his economy.",
  "And I think that kind of shows you the tone and tenor we are likely to see from the Republicans as they work to chip away at the credibility of this agency, if in fact, this investigation does continue in the weeks and months to come, as we expect it will.",
  "It would not be as his role as a former head of state, and -- but you could imagine Donald Trump taking to Twitter and having something to say about that if President Obama was headed to that wedding before he had a formal visit to the U.K. as President.",
  "The administration needs to be relying on intelligence and analysis from the CIA to really make decisions about what is going to change Kim Jong-un's path away from his illegal actions and more towards being in line with his international obligations.",
  "Apparently, that didn't work very well in getting some of that money back, but now Vladimir Putin is apparently counting on the fact that many Russians with capital abroad fear that there could be additional sanctions and might bring the money back.",
  "The Russians and the North Koreans for months have been trying to blame the United States' routine annual military exercises with countries like Japan, our rhetoric, our behavior more generally, for the escalating situation on the Korean Peninsula.",
  "FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's certainly one of the most clear indications, Brianna, that we've been getting recently that the Russians don't expect that tensions with the U.S. are going to ease any time soon.",
  "There may be somebody who you think is diametrically opposed to you when it comes to their political views, but you root for the same sports team or notice that they're really good parents, and that's something that you as a parent care about.",
  "And they were saying if we get this big tax cut, because that's the legislation of all legislations, that's the biggest there is, but that included ANWAR, as you know, and it included the repeal of the individual mandate, which is a disaster.",

  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Congressman, how concerned are you that there is this growing number of Republicans who are joining President Trump in criticism of what are supposed to be impartial institutions, the DOJ and the FBI?",
  "KEILAR: I want to switch gears a little bit, David, and talk about this sort of push and pull between what's become kind of the Steve Bannon side of the Republican Party and maybe the establishment side of the Republican Party.",
  "It is interesting that you see former President Obama now outside of the Oval Office speaking a little bit more freely in this casual conversation with Prince Harry, you know, being able to kind of speak out a little bit more.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[17:19:01] KEILAR: President Trump played another round of golf today near his Florida resort, and this time he managed to stay out of sight, but moments ago, he did make an unannounced public appearance.",
  "If they are assured that the United States has no strategic interests in regime change, I think it will go a long way to making sure that we are secure and that we don't have a scenario where we are threatened by North Korea.",
  "Has the Trump administration, by waiting to act, because they've had this window that expires at the end of next month to act, has that given Putin too much time to figure out loopholes to try to get around these sanctions?",

  "People would be surprised that right now there is only one way North Korea can communicate to the United States government, and that's through their representative in New York at the U.N. Well, that's highly dangerous.",
  "PLEITGEN: Well, you know, this is part of a pattern that we've been seeing from the Russians over the past couple of days of being more aggressive towards the United States and America's presence there inside Syria.",
  "They're not able to tell us exactly what kind of equipment, but it's the kind of thing that is making them watch for the possibility in the coming days or weeks of another missile launch or even a satellite launch.",
  "KEILAR: Because he has -- Bannon stood by, until the very end, Roy Moore, someone who had multiple very credible accusers, including someone who had been as young as 14 years old accusing him of sexual misconduct.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for new sanctions from the U.S. that are expected to kick in if the Trump administration acts, and it could impact millions -- billions of dollars of Russian assets.",
  "I mean, the president has a tough rhetoric against Russia, but when it comes to actually imposing the sanctions, that's actually what will make a difference, and that's clearly in the United States' interests.",
  "And just earlier today Vladimir Putin published an article, yet again talking about our offensive rhetoric and bellicose behavior, and not talking about North Korea's ongoing threat to the international order.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n[17:55:06] TODD: Analysts say if the North Koreans don't engage in a violent provocation during the Winter Olympics, they're at least likely to send spies into South Korea during the games.",
  "I mean, so what's the evidence -- what's the evidence, then, that bias has impacted this investigation when the very data points you're putting there, actually action has been taken against those individuals?",
  "North Korea has used tunnels to try to insert commandos and frogmen into South Korea for spying and assassinations, and the regime has a history of violence surrounding major South Korean sporting events.",
  "Not directly challenging President Donald Trump, but certainly leaving an impact and certainly the impression that he has something to say about the rhetoric that we see coming from the Oval Office today.",
  "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I don't think that the FBI's credibility is under fire here, because the fact is, Brianna, they continue to do their jobs and to do their jobs very well.",
  "It's really striking to hear, though, the words the president used earlier in this week in his tweet where he himself called the FBI tainted, speaking about the nation's premier law enforcement agency.",
  "KEILAR: You just heard Fred's report there that Russian President Vladimir Putin is getting ready for these possible new sanctions from the U.S. that could impact billions of dollars in Russian assets.",

  "Sam, around the world when other countries look at the U.S. and they see this internal friction and the president calling the FBI tainted, what does that do to how the U.S. is perceived?",
  "It wants to put everybody on notice that, when it is doing these exercises, especially near North Korea, it is simply for training, that there are no military operations in the works.",
  "KEILAR: I want to talk to you about politics and ask you, since you've been calling for progressives in your state of California to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein from the left.",
  "So I'm heartened that the president's team seems to be listening to the experts who believe that we can at least keep the United States secure by engaging in talks with North Korea.",
  "After President Trump called the FBI tainted, a Republican congressman calls for a purge of America's top law enforcement agency, accusing it of being biased against the president.",
  "I wonder what you think about this development and if this has anything to do with, for instance, some of the fallout from Roy Moore, a Bannon-backed candidate who didn't work out.",
  "But in terms of signing legislation, the reality is this president has signed fewer bills in his first year in office since any administration going back to Eisenhower -- Brianna.",
  "KHANNA: Well, with all due respect to Congressman Rooney, there's probably only one institution that the American citizens want a purge of, and that's the United States Congress.",
  "This may be the new strategy, the new policy right now, but will President Trump adopt it, or will he engage in his own rhetoric about North Korea, perhaps on Twitter -- Brianna?",
  "But they clearly received some external pressure and saw here that this is not good for the Bannon or Breitbart brand, even though it was somebody they had supported in the past.",
  "And I'm not sure government can legislate that, but what I do believe is that all of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the Internet.",
  "KEILAR: You really think that bilateral negotiations could stop North Korea, which has a considerable interest in developing and miniaturizing a nuclear warhead, from doing so?",

  "A lot of the work that the FBI does isn't public because it's secret and part of ongoing investigations, but we know, for example, that they're having a lot of successes.",
  "The sort of FOX News echo chamber and the president and his allies as they have been spouting these talking points, it is getting a welcome audience among Republicans.",
  "[17:35:11] And I think what you see here is a keen understanding that Bannon has taken on some water, and Breitbart has taken on some water for some past affiliations.",
  "So look for less talk about all of that, more discreet, not talking about what these exercises, when exactly they're going to happen and what they're going to involve.",
  "I will speak with Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of the Armed Services Committee; and our correspondents, specialists and guests are standing by with full coverage.",
  "What's new this time around is that the president isn't fighting back and instead, he's doing the very things that the Russian intelligence services are trying to do.",

  "He went somewhere other than the golf course, this time to stop by a local firehouse to thank firefighters there but also to tout his legislative accomplishments.",

  "He said, \"Given the foreign restrictions,\" meaning the sanctions, obviously, \"which instead of lessening, on the contrary, appear to have a tendency to increase.\"",
  "CNN is also learning the Trump administration has decided to be more discrete about military exercises amid new calls for direct talks with Kim Jong-un's regime.",
  "But they're saying the reason why they're doing that is because ISIS was ousted from many of these places, they don't want ISIS to return once again -- Brianna.",
  "So Congressman, earlier today one of your Republican colleagues,\n\n\n\nCongressman Rooney -- Congressman Francis Rooney of Florida, called for a purge at the FBI.",

  "Congressman Francis Rooney tells me that may be a pretty strong word, but he says the bureau should oust individuals he views as politically compromised.",
  "All of this comes at a very sensitive time, because the Pentagon also is going to tone it down, we are told, about U.S. military exercises in the region.",
  "So this begs the question, they have a little bit of a bromance --\n\n\n\nDAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Well, he picked the right answer on \"Suits.\"",
  "I would -- I don't know this for sure, but I would presume perhaps some of their donors perhaps also called Bannon and said there might be concern here.",
  "This does come as you noted, Brianna, after an escalation of this incendiary rhetoric from this candidate, this challenger to House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
  "A senior administration official saying the Trump administration has decided to tone down the rhetoric accompanying its military drills in the region.",
  "What do you think about this, that Republicans in growing numbers are taking aim at the DOJ and at the FBI and trying to undercut this investigation?",
  "There is bipartisan consensus that Russia launched an information warfare campaign to undermine confidence in our institutions and to sow divisions.",
  "So of course, we need to continue to be vigilant to make sure that all those people who voted for the resolution actually enforce the resolution.",
  "They learned the lesson of Gadhafi in Libya, and they looked at Saddam Hussein, and they said, \"We don't want to be victims to regime change.\"",
  "So I think it's in the president's own interests to put that to rest, to impose the sanctions and do what Congress wants the president to do.",
  "KEILAR: Meantime, the Russians are essentially accusing the U.S. of training former ISIS fighters, Fred, in an attempt to destabilize Syria.",

  "I think to David's point, there is something of a cost-benefit analysis being weighed here, and obviously, the cost was just too great.",
  "I want to talk to you about why you have criticism of them, but first, are you sure you want to be throwing a word like \"purge\" around?",
  "KEILAR: And coming up, a Republican congressman calls for a purge of the FBI, accusing the FBI, the DOJ of bias against the president.",
