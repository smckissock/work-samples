  "Winner: Director Mark Mylod, who spices up some long, talky scenes with pretty images\n\nWhether it’s Ellaria and Tyene straining to reach each other from their separate bonds, or Jaime standing over the conquered Olenna but realizing how little he actually understands, or even just that first meeting between Dany and Jon, which keeps cutting to wide shots to emphasize how far apart the characters are physically (as well as alliance-wise), Mylod comes up with some smart ways to stage scenes that could have easily become long-winded and boring.",
  "He’s rapidly turning into that guy you don’t want to sit next to at the dinner party, the one who keeps saying, “Yes, we’re having fun right now, but death is coming for us all.” Technically, probably, he’s a winner, since he gets the dragonglass without having to swear allegiance to Dany — but I make the rules here, and I’ve decided he’s got to lighten up.",
  "Other winners: Melisandre, for knowing how both her and Varys die, for some reason; Sansa, for understanding very basic things like “People need food to live” when everybody else in Winterfell forgot about them; the long night, for apparently returning in the near future; Jorah, for not dying of greyscale; Davos, for keeping everybody from fighting.",
  "Jorah will be back with Dany just in time to explain to her exactly what she needs to do to win the war, and Sam gets to be proud of his ability to properly follow instructions, like a smitten boyfriend who wants his girlfriend to be really impressed he printed out the AllRecipes.com recipe for chicken parmesan and made it exactly so.",
  "For a moment, I thought perhaps Jaime and Cersei had figured out Olenna was behind the assassination of Joffrey way back in season four — after all, they were having her drink poison out of a wine glass — but from the shock on his face once she admitted to the crime, the thought obviously hadn’t occurred to Jaime.",
  "Granted, I probably didn’t need to see the invasions of either Casterly Rock or Highgarden in great detail, but the show’s approach (which is to have a few bloody images with somebody summarizing what’s happening in voiceover) occupies a weird middle ground that doesn’t really satisfy one way or the other.",
  "Winner: Foreshadowing\n\nI was idly speculating with a friend the other day that one of Dany’s dragons just has to die at some point before the end — and then this episode spent so much time talking about how indestructible they are that I’m pretty sure it’s going to happen in the next episode.",
  "“The Queen’s Justice,” the third episode of Game of Thrones’ seventh season, so thoroughly makes the argument that the final two combatants in the battle for the Iron Throne will be Cersei Lannister and the Night King that I might be a little disappointed when Daenerys inevitably rallies.",
  "Yes, A Game of Thrones, the first book in George R. R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire series came out 21 years ago in 1996, and the natural response to reading it was to wonder how on earth Martin was going to weave together his two most far-flung characters into the same narrative.",
  "Other losers: House Tyrell, for being so bad at maximizing its strategic advantage throughout the entire series; poetic justice, for not realizing it was being meted out against Olenna; Theon, because I forgot he was in this episode entirely; Varys, for not being immortal.",
  "Yes, the characters mostly remained frozen in space, but Mylod made every little inch that Jon got closer to Dany count, and when they were finally in the same place (when she came down to tell him he could mine dragonglass), that, too, had a significance to it.",
  "Winner: Book readers, who’ve been waiting decades for some of this stuff\n\nThe first person to say, “Boy, I can’t wait for Daenerys and Jon to meet!” probably said that while wondering if Bill Clinton or Bob Dole would win the upcoming presidential election.",
  "I rather doubt that this series has been building to Daenerys arriving in Westeros and promptly revealing just how unimpressive she truly is, but “The Queen’s Justice” is the first episode that made me think this might end up being just a little amazing.",
  "A lengthy scene between Diana Rigg and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau offered both actors meaty material to rip into as Jaime offered Olenna what he obviously thought was a kind way to leave this world, then she sunk in her teeth after she’d imbibed the poison.",
  "But “The Queen’s Justice” explicitly pits Cersei against Dany in both its script structure (which devotes barely any time to characters not in King’s Landing or Dragonstone) and in the way director Mark Mylod’s shots play the two off of each other.",
  "Loser: Fans of big battle scenes\n\nI know the show is evidently trying to save money for something, but boy, the battles in this episode felt like they were thrown together over a couple of days with some spare props the show had just laying around.",
  "Winner: Tyrion Lannister’s flair for storytelling\n\nSet aside the complete and utter implausibility of Tyrion only deciding to tell all his best pals about his secret plan to defeat Casterly Rock until weeks after the Unsullied set sail.",
  "Winner: Cersei Lannister\n\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory, and I’ve already delved into much of why she wins in this episode above, but allow me to advance a perhaps controversial theory: What if Cersei is the hero of this story?",
  "Warfare is often about trying to guess what your enemy is thinking, but Dany and Tyrion (especially) are far too enamored of what they’re thinking, which means they go down to ignominious defeat over and over again in this episode.",
  "He paces it properly, and puts the twist in just the right place, and he’s conscientious enough to be explaining what’s happening in such a way that we can follow the largely disjointed shots of the Unsullied taking Casterly Rock.",
  "If there’s one thing the characters in this show are supposed to have deeply ingrained in their psyches by this point, it’s the idea that you must do anything you can to secure power, even if it stretches the rules of propriety.",
  "One of the big things that Game of Thrones struggles with is that it constantly subverts expectations, while simultaneously seeming to play out a dual “chosen one who will save the kingdom” narrative involving Dany and Jon.",
  "In the meantime, Olenna got in some barbs against Joffrey and Cersei (she’s a “disease,” and Olenna is sorry for her role in spreading that plague) and mocked Jaime for just how in over his head he is in re: Cersei.",
  "One presumes there will be something very important in those manuscripts — we’re getting so much Sam this season, so he’s obviously going to uncover something important — but for now, he’s still doing grunt work.",
  "The idea that the show would end with Dany and Jon facing off against Cersei, then turning their attention to an epic battle against the evil of the White Walkers, has always felt a little too easy to me.",
  "While Dany’s been off freeing slaves and gathering her army, Cersei has been slowly steeping herself in her own bitter grievances, and she’s somehow become the greatest military strategist of all time.",
  "What’s odd about the episode is that it’s a bit of a throwback to the show’s first season, when major, major battles mostly happened offscreen, then were summarized by the characters afterward.",
  "Blocking — the process of moving actors around within the frame — isn’t always this show’s strong suit, but I found the Jon and Dany scenes, especially, to be exceptions to this rule.",
  "Loser: Sam, who lost for winning\n\nTechnically, I suppose, I should argue that Sam is a winner for having cured Jorah’s greyscale, in a manner that impressed even the Arch Maester.",
  "But what if Cersei, who has learned and learned and learned from every single failure and dark moment and horrible action over the years, is the one we’re supposed to cheer on?",
  "I think it makes some sense that Tyrion would underestimate his sister, but I also feel like it’s a bit of a stretch that he wouldn’t have seen any of Cersei’s attacks coming.",
  "— is hollow, because she was basically set up to take it by the Lannisters, who left the Unsullied now occupying the fortress without provisions or much of anything at all.",
  "Along the way, it introduced some pointless busywork to keep us all occupied, but now, those balls are descending and crashing into each other, and it’s kind of marvelous.",
  "I mean, yes, Jon, this is something you need to deal with, but don’t lose sight of the fact that you need Dany’s dragonglass by leading with your craziest fan theories.",
  "Yara and Ellaria are held prisoner in King’s Landing, and the latter is forced to watch as Cersei doses her daughter, Tyene, with a deadly poison contained in a kiss.",
  "Basically, I can see all of everything, so I basically know everything you need to do to beat the White Walkers.”\n\nSansa: “Are you going to tell me?”\n\nBran: “No.",
  "Olenna’s admission of her guilt in Joffrey’s murder to Jaime hasn’t been quite as long in, coming but has still been one of those things fans are waiting for.",
  "The Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is making quick work of her opponents so far, and Dany had better start learning some lessons from all this losing quickly.",
  "And at any rate, the only reason he gets anything done in this episode is because Tyrion gets him to let go of the obsession for a couple of seconds.",
  "The Tyrion of “The Queen’s Justice” is way too cocksure and unable to see the speeding train with his sister’s name on it headed right for him.",
  "And I’m gonna be a real creep about it.”\n\nSansa: “Asshole.”\n\nWinner: Euron Greyjoy’s cocky smile\n\nI mean, who couldn’t love a face like that?",
  "I can see all of time.”\n\nSansa: “Okay, well, time for you to become Lord of Winterfell!”\n\nBran: “Oh, I don’t think I’ll be doing that.",
  "“The Queen’s Justice” is an episode of talking and talking and talking, but Mylod turns out to be a great fit for all that chattering.",
  "(In the most famous example of this, Tyrion was about to head into battle himself before he was knocked out and missed everything.)",
  "Set aside, even, the way that he drones on about just how hard it will be to take the fortress before doing a hard pivot to, “JK.",
  "Of course, Tyrion can’t really be a winner, because...\n\nLoser: Tyrion Lannister’s flair for military tactics\n\nGood Lord, Tyrion.",
  "This is an episode about characters, half a continent apart, circling each other, and Mylod captures that wariness beautifully.",
  "Loser: Jon Snow, who sounds like he’s losing it\n\nJon has become really, really bad at tailoring his message to his audience.",
  "And if you’re not a book reader, the show still gains power from just how long it’s managed to put a lot of this stuff off.",
  "What’s more, how did nobody on Team Dany realize that Highgarden was perhaps the most prized location for Cersei to grab?",
  "This happened back when the show was in budget conservation mode — not now that it has more money than anybody else.",
  "Everybody else on the show has some degree of hopefulness at this point, but Cersei knows that’s all foolishness.",
  "But this episode came dangerously close to making me think she not only will win the war but should win the war.",
  "It tossed a bunch of balls in the air back in season one, then waited to see how long they would hang up there.",
  "Not every character who dies on this show should get a lengthy parting scene — but I’m so, so glad Olenna did.",
  "He has a bad tendency to blunder into basically any situation and start ranting about the Army of the Dead.",
  "Remember when you defended King’s Landing against the invasion of Stannis at the Battle of the Blackwater?",
  "Remember how you came up with all of those great ideas about how to hold the city and the use of wildfire?",
  "If nothing else, he’ll be a cinch to win several sessions of whatever Westeros’s version of The Moth is.",
  "Winner: Olenna Tyrell, who won for losing\n\nDid Olenna end this episode drinking a giant glass of poison?",
  "Jaime’s right — if Cersei wins this war, nobody will care what she did to build the world that follows.",
  "And, sure, that’s a pretty grim view of the world, but, hey, look at the world these characters occupy.",
  "Just like...\n\nLoser: Bran Stark, for becoming a major bummer\n\nSansa: “It’s so good to see you, Bran.",
  "The Unsullied take Casterly Rock but it’s the definition of winning a battle but losing the war.",
  "You don’t load up a story with that much foreshadowing without paying it off very, very quickly.",
  "Here are the seven winners and six losers who made “The Queen’s Justice” just a bit of a drag.",
  "So we watch and wait to see if the show can possibly catch everything that’s up in the air.",
  "And even then, it’s “Army of the Dead this,” and “Army of the Dead that.” What a bummer!",
  "There’s a secret back door in.”\n\nTyrion’s still got a flair for telling a great story.",
  "It’s almost like they’re dancing, and try though she might, Dany can’t take the lead.",
  "I’m glad you’re alive.”\n\nBran: “I am both alive and dead, for I can see both states.",
  "Sure, he’s not kicked out of the Citadel, but he has to copy all those manuscripts.",
  "Wouldn’t he have surmised that Euron and company would be out there, at least?",
  "That means this episode is about evenly split between winners and losers, too.",
  "That’s going to prove deadly if she doesn’t figure out what she’s doing soon.",
  "Meanwhile, Cersei wipes out the Tyrells and much of the rest of Dany’s fleet.",
  "Meanwhile, Dany hangs out at Dragonstone and rants about how great she is.",
  "Even Dany’s greatest triumph in this episode — she takes Casterly Rock!",
  "I’m the Three-Eyed Raven.”\n\nSansa: “What’s that?”\n\nBran: “Ha ha ha!",
  "That’s the only way you can ensure the safety of those around you.",
  "There’s something worth admiring there, even if you’d rather not.",
  "Loser: Basically every other one of Dany’s allies\n\nOlenna dies.",
  "(Before, I was just betting on somewhere in the final season.)",
  "Sansa and Bran haven’t seen each other since early season one.",
  "Even better, Sam doesn’t have to do anything gross this week.",
  "Every time Sam does something good, he gets punished for it.",
  "In some ways, Game of Thrones is an elaborate juggling act.",
  "I know he’s a horrible pirate, but he’s so happy about it.",
  "And Sansa was right back in the season premiere, too.",
  "Yeah, she has the help of Qyburn and Jaime and Euron.",
  "Cersei will probably see her comeuppance eventually.",
  "I’m going to revisit your wedding day, a.k.a.",
  "Doesn’t that make a certain amount of sense?",
  "Maybe that’s what the series was going for.",
  "But oh boy was it fun watching her go out.",
  "Tyrion’s smarts are seriously in question.",
  "Probably not, but that’s part of the fun.",
  "Is this the last we’ll see of her?",
  "the worst day of your entire life.",
  "That’s how stories usually work.",
  "Which dragon will die, though?",
  "What happened to that Tyrion?",
  "But it goes beyond even that.",
  "You are like a little baby!",
  "That’s what counts, right?",
  "Get it together, Tyrion!",
  "We were counting on you!",
  "It was still a bit odd.",
  "See you later, Sam!",
  "Place your bets.",
  "Win-win, right?",
  "Probably.",
  "Yes.",
  "Nah."
