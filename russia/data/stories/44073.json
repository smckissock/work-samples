  "And she is still only willing to pay lip service to Parliament, giving it an up-or-down vote only on the final text of the withdrawal agreement — a vote she has vowed to ignore if it doesn’t go her way.",
  "And we now know that the same company that used personal data to individualize propaganda and fake news in President Trump’s campaign — Cambridge Analytica — was paid to work for the “Leave” side.",
  "Despite this, the referendum was used to circumvent Parliament, and it took a lawsuit for the Supreme Court to finally grant members of Parliament the right to vote on invoking Article 50.",

  "leaders were willing to work with the British, giving ground on core issues such as immigration and exemption from the principle of an “ever closer Union.” When that didn’t work, the E.U.",
  "A coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, for instance, would bring Parliament back into the process, and this would bode much better for British democracy as Brexit plays out.",

  "Finally, British Prime Minister Theresa May — who only inherited her position from Cameron – has been on shaky ground in her pursuit of a hard Brexit.",
  "The dramatic loss of support that May has already experienced, especially in the face of a weak opponent, makes her approach even less legitimate.",

  "With no single, written constitution, British governance since the 17th century has been based firmly in the supremacy of Parliament.",
