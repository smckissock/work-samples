  "After that meeting, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on that committee who has been a fierce Trump critic, said Kushner’s appearance was “very productive” and that “we had an opportunity to ask about a range of issues the Committee has been concerned about.” But so far the public is in the dark about what, precisely, that range of issues is.",
  "Barring any last-minute negotiation to appear behind closed doors, Manafort’s testimony tomorrow is a crucial moment for Republican lawmakers to demonstrate their independence from President Trump’s unhinged rants about the Russia investigation and his refusal to accept the conclusion of the intelligence community that Russia indeed interfered in our election.",
  "It will also be a crucial opportunity for them to demonstrate a backbone and to stand up to Trump and his claims that the Russia investigation is a “hoax,” “witch hunt,” or “fake news.”\n\nYesterday, presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner released an 11-page statement seeking to exonerate himself, but that left unanswered a number of key questions.",
  "While the Committee has a keen interest in what Manafort has to say, and in the documents he has promised to provide, the public will not have the opportunity to see and assess not only Manafort’s testimony, but also lawmakers’ willingness to pursue the truth about Russia election interference, and any collusion of the Trump campaign with it.",
  "Trump Jr. has offered shifting accounts of the meeting and why it was organized, first claiming it was about adoptions, then that Veselnitskaya provided no useful information about Clinton, then that he took the meeting as a “courtesy” to Goldstone, and finally, and that it was no big deal.",
  "A public appearance by Manafort tomorrow would mark the first time a witness from President Trump’s inner circle will testify under oath at an open hearing about Russian interference in the U.S. election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian actors in that interference.",
  "Today the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort to testify before the committee at a public hearing tomorrow on enforcement of the Federal Agents Registration Act and foreign attempts to influence U.S. elections.",
  "This will prove to a pivotal moment for the public to see — and assess — the willingness of Republican lawmakers to press a (former) top Trump campaign official on the details of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian individuals and entities.",
  "Unlike Kushner and Trump Jr., who have both hidden behind their political inexperience by claiming that they attended the meeting without vetting or exploring the motivations of the people involved, Manafort can make no such pretense.",
  "In the now-notorious email chain released by Trump Jr., Goldstone promised Trump that Veselnitskaya would have dirt on Hillary Clinton, and Trump Jr. eagerly accepted the meeting and then invited Kushner and Manafort.",
  "Manafort’s notes undoubtedly will be of keen interest to investigators, as they could expose more detail than previously known about the meeting — or could even conflict with other attendees’ accounts of it.",
  "Just last month, Manafort retroactively filed forms required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, reporting that he received $17.1 million in payments from Ukraine’s Party of Regions from 2012 to 2014.",
  "UPDATE: After this post was published, the Senate Judiciary Committee, as it hinted it might do, reached an agreement with Manafort in which he will provide documents and an interview behind closed doors.",
  "He reportedly turned over his notes about the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya that had been arranged by Donald Trump Jr. and music promoter Rob Goldstone.",
  "While the Judiciary Committee left open the possibility they could negotiate with Manafort for a closed-door interview, barring that, the subpoena requires him to appear at the hearing tomorrow.",
  "Last August, his resignation from the Trump campaign was triggered by a report that he had received $12.7 million in off-the-books cash payments from a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party.",
  "At the time of the Trump Tower meeting, he was Donald Trump’s campaign manager, not an informal adviser brought on solely because the candidate valued keeping family close to his campaign.",
  "As Kushner spoke with House Intelligence Committee members today, Manafort appeared before bipartisan staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee for a closed-door, transcribed interview.",
  "He was no innocent when it came to campaigns and opposition research, and he certainly was no neophyte about the politics of Russia and the former Soviet Union — far from it.",
  "The subpoena came, according to a statement from the committee’s top Republican and Democrat, after Manafort refused to appear voluntarily for a transcribed interview.",
  "Surely the same excuses offered by Kushner and Trump Jr. for why the meeting with Veselnitskaya was scheduled would not be remotely credible if offered by Manafort.",
  "And just last week, the New York Times reported that Manafort was in debt to Russian lenders before he joined the Trump campaign — to the tune of $17 million.",
  "Similarly, Kushner appeared today for a second interview with congressional investigators, this time with members of the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "Kushner yesterday claimed to have little knowledge of why it was organized, and further claimed he lacked interest in it and left early.",
  "Although he made his written statement public, his interview yesterday with Senate Intelligence Committee staff was behind closed doors.",
  "Tomorrow, Senate Judiciary Committee members will have an opportunity to probe Manafort on questions about the meeting, in public view.",
  "While the witness’s answers are necessary, so are the lawmakers’ questions and the public’s ability to see them asked.",
  "Manafort was seen as a veteran political operator hired to bring order to Trump’s chaotic “outsider” campaign.",
  "Manafort had deep ties to Russian entities, dating back many years before he landed in Trumpland.",
  "But Manafort likely saw the meeting from a different vantage point."
