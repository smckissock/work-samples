  "Aalok Devkota: Although I like to buy fundamentally strong companies that will be able to grow both on the top and bottom, I do not like to go against the main trend and the main trend is no longer up.",
  "Aalok Devkota has outperformed 75% of U.S. equity mutual fund managers for the last 3 years in part because we allow him to take defensive action for our clients when he sees fit.",
  "If you own one of these mutual funds, but you agree with Aalok’s assessment of the market, you are likely to be more fully invested than you would like right now.",
  "I believed that the decline in revenue growth and higher CapEx will lead to lower income and that is what happened with when they came out with their Q4 results.",
  "Devkota: Broadcom is another great company that I liked and they have done an amazing job of buying companies that add value to their existing shareholders.",
  "For those with an investment time frame that is less than a full market cycle, I think it makes sense to be less than fully invested at this time.",
  "My Take: Since February, the market has turned decisively choppy causing many to question whether the market’s main direction is still up.",
  "I do not think that the market is fully pricing in the magnitude of this development and when it does FB will likely go down much lower.",
  "Mutual funds that require themselves to have 80% or more of their assets invested all of the time have tied their own managers hands.",
  "Devkota: When I saw the news I thought that FB would open down 20% or more but it was not down as much as I thought it would be.",
  "Devkota: After selling Facebook and Broadcom, I added some inverse ETFs to partially hedge against my other positions.",
  "However, once the battle with QCOM went from bad to worse I felt that this could be a near-term top for the stock.",
  "But nearly all mutual funds tie their manager's hands by requiring them to be almost fully invested all the time.",
  "My strategy is to reduce exposure regardless as it does not make sense to be fully invested at this time.",
  "After the sell-off that we saw in early February I knew that I wanted to sell Facebook in the next rally.",
  "It is too early to tell if this is the beginning of a new bear market or just a much-needed correction.",
  "In the last 3 quarters of 2017, revenue growth declined while CapEx was increasing at the same time.",
  "One of the most valuable things a good portfolio manager does is turn defensive at the right times.",
  "Ever since the sell-off and expansion in volatility in early February I have been very cautious.",
  "If you would like to be notified when I write about stocks you are following, click here.",
  "His fund is an investment option for clients of our separately managed account program.",
  "Kam: Did the news about Cambridge Analytica influence your decision to sell Facebook?",
  "I am long 70% stocks, 10% inverse ETF so net-long 60% with the rest in cash.",
  "In addition, the stock failed to rally with the market in last few months.",
  "If so, it’s time to consider reducing your investment in that fund.",
  "Consequently, Aalok’s recent trades make sense for many investors.",
  "2017 was a very good year but I started noticing some cracks.",
  "I would not be surprised to see it lose 50% of its value.",
  "Kam: How are you reducing your exposure to the market?",
  "Ken Kam: You have been doing a lot of trading lately.",
  "For information about investing with him, click here.",
  "Kam: How much have you reduced your market exposure?",
  "Devkota: I sold Facebook and Broadcom last week.",
  "Facebook has done very well since mid-2013.",
  "That is exactly what he is doing now.",
  "See my previous coverage of Facebook.",
  "Aalok does not run a mutual fund.",
  "Kam: Why did you sell Broadcom?",
  "What is driving that?"
