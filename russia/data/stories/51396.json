  "The most extensive is the New Yorker’s October 2014 profile, “The Revenge of Rand Paul.” Also worth a read is a Forbes article from last fall, “Who Is Rand Paul?”\n\nThe New York Times profiled Paul in “Rand Paul’s Mixed Inheritance,” Politico ran “Rand Paul’s Republican Revolution,” and Vogue has “Could Republican Senator Rand Paul Win the White House?”\n\nReason has taken on the question, “Is Rand Paul Becoming Less ‘Libertarian-ish’?” The Washington Post offers up “8 Things You Need to Know About Presidential Candidate Rand Paul” and “A Brief Guide to What Rand Paul Actually Believes.”\n\nJames M. Lindsay is Senior Vice President, Director of Studies, and Maurice R. Greenberg Chair at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
  "He advocated “a foreign policy that recognizes our limits and preserves our might, a common sense conservative realism of strength and action.” He laid out four principles of this “conservative realism.”\n\nFirst, the United States should be cautious in using military force:\n\nWar is necessary when America is attacked or threatened, when vital American interests are attacked and threatened, and when we have exhausted all other measures short of war.",
  "He wants “an America strong enough to deter foreign aggression, but wise enough to avoid unnecessary intervention.” He singled out jihadists as enemy Number 1, but he won’t get bogged down in rebuilding other societies:\n\nIn my vision for America, freedom and prosperity at home can only be achieved if we defend against enemies who are dead-set on attacking America.",
  "Senator from Kentucky (2011–present); Ophthalmologist\n\nTwitter Handle: @SenRandPaul\n\nPaul took the stage at his campaign kickoff event today in a hotel ballroom in Louisville, Kentucky to the enthusiastic and alliterative cheers of President Paul!” He didn’t bury his lead:\n\nI have a message that is loud and clear and it does not mince words.",
  "The Basics:\n\nName: Randal “Rand” Howard Paul\n\nDate of Birth: January 7, 1963\n\nPlace of Birth: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nReligion: Episcopalian\n\nPolitical Party: Republican Party\n\nMarital Status: Married to Kelley\n\nChildren: William (21), Duncan (18) and Robert (15)\n\nAlma Mater: Baylor University; Duke University Medical School\n\nCareer: U.S.",
  "The WashingtonPost.com has compiled a short video of “Rand Paul in His Own Words.”\n\nPaul did an interview with Salon in November, discussing his “attempt to broaden his appeal, particularly to non-white and young voters.” He laid out his views on diplomacy in an article in the National Interest.",
  "Paul’s Story\n\nRand Paul’s website states his pitch to the voters succinctly: He is “an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility, and a warrior against government overreach.” Paul rode the Tea Party wave in 2010 to the seat he currently occupies in the Senate.",
  "After Mitt Romney lost in 2012, Paul told CNN that the GOP was “in danger of becoming a dinosaur,” adding:\n\nWe need a new type of Republican [Party], I think, one that involves some of the ideas of libertarian leaning Republicans and people who agree in a less aggressive foreign policy.",
  "But I also signed onto the letter because I want the president to negotiate from a position of strength which means that he needs to be telling them in Iran that “I’ve got Congress to deal with.”\n\nPaul is less eager than most of his Republican colleagues to spend more on defense.",
  "Second, when the United States does use military force, that decision must authorized by Congress, not launched based on vague claims of presidential power or at the behest of foreign governments:\n\nCongress, the people’s representative, must authorize the decision to intervene….",
  "Paul’s beef had less to do with Brennan’s qualifications for the job and more to do with the Obama administration’s drone policy, particularly the White House’s refusal to state definitively whether drones can be used against American citizens on U.S. soil.",
  "But if he is more interested in restraining U.S. actions overseas rather than expanding them, as many of his GOP rivals suspect, then occasions for a Paul White House to square off with Capitol Hill over presidential powers might be few and far between.",
  "The fact that Paul has edged closer to the Republican mainstream on foreign policy in recent months—one of his first campaign events will take place in front of an aircraft carrier—suggests that he worries that his rivals might be right.",
  "So it’s not surprising that last September he penned an op-ed for Time magazine entitled, “I Am Not an Isolationist.”\n\nPaul laid out his foreign policy vision in a speech last October to the Center for the National Interest.",
  "Just don’t expect a Paul administration to use foreign aid to win friends and influence people overseas:\n\nWe must realize, though, that we do not project strength by borrowing money from China to send it Pakistan.",
  "He has harshly criticized the decision to intervene in Libya, because “Libya is now more chaotic and America is less safe.” He supports air strikes in Syria, but he adamantly opposes arming Syrian rebels.",
  "Former Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer says of Paul:\n\nHe is the only Republican who seems to know about what their long-term structural problems are… I think it’s a little bit of a warning sign to Democrats.",
  "Doing that mean returning to the principles of the Constitution:\n\nWe need to go boldly forth under the banner of liberty that clutches the Constitution in one hand and the Bill of Rights in the other.",
  "He says that he signed the letter because he wants the best deal possible, not because he is against a deal:\n\nThere’s no one in Washington more against war and more for a negotiated deal than I am.",
  "It’s disproportionately affected the poor and the black and brown among us.”\n\nPaul’s assessment of the demographic challenge facing the Republican Party has caught the attention of some Democrats.",
  "Paul has defended Obama’s approach, however, and challenged two of Obama’s loudest critics, Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Marco Rubio, on the issue:\n\nAre you ready to send ground troops into Iran?",
  "Let me be very clear: France doesn’t send our men and women in uniform to war, the United Nations doesn’t send our soldiers to war, Congress and only Congress can constitutionally initiate war!",
  "Third, the United States must be committed to both diplomacy and leadership:\n\nMilitary force is meaningless if our leaders cannot reinforce American diplomacy through engagement and leadership.",
  "He proposes to leverage America’s relationship with China “to influence the behavior of North Korea.”\n\nEconomic policy\n\nPaul’s positions on the U.S. economy are unsurprising for a Republican.",
  "Not a little tweaking at the edges… I will struggle to make the Republican Party a different party, a bigger party, a more diverse party, and a party that can win national elections again.",
  "He went further in a conversation last year with Glenn Beck:\n\nI think Republicans will not win [the presidency] again in my lifetime… unless they become a new GOP, a new Republican Party.",
  "On Monday, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) formally announced his presidential campaign, making him the second Republican candidate, after Ted Cruz, to officially throw his hat into the ring.",
  "Most of Paul’s likely Republican presidential rivals have criticized President Obama’s strategy for stopping Iran’s nuclear program and have called for more sanctions on Tehran.",
  "More on Paul\n\nPaul’s 2012 book, Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed, Abused, and Imprisoned by the Feds, outlines his view on the federal government.",
  "Paul laments the GOP’s failure to court younger voters and especially minorities:\n\nRepublicans haven’t gone to African-Americans or to Hispanics and said, “You know what?",
  "He is running as an outsider on the slogan of: “Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream.” He wants lower taxes, less regulation, and more school choice.",
  "Paul has consistently argued that the Constitution mandates that Congress play a prominent role in foreign policy, especially when it comes to the use of military force.",
  "In March he called the defense spending plans that Senators Cruz and Rubio favor “reckless.” Paul argues that more spending on defense must be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
  "Paul made national news in 2013 when he waged a 13-hour filibuster on the Senate floor against the John Brennan’s nomination to be the Director of Central Intelligence.",
  "He supports passing the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), though he admits to having qualms about how TPA requires Congress to give up some of its leverage on trade.",
  "He argued in Time magazine that “We Must Demilitarize the Police” in the wake of the Ferguson protests, setting out views somewhat unconventional for a Republican.",
  "But Paul was also one of the 47 senators who signed the letter written by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) warning Iran that any deal it signs might be quickly undone.",
  "We need a national defense robust enough to defend against all attack, modern enough to deter all enemies and nimble enough to defend our vital interests.",
  "Last October, Time magazine put Paul on its cover and asked, “Can he fix what ails the GOP?” Paul certainly has ambitions to remake the Republican Party.",
  "By the same token, Paul says he plans to be strong enough to negotiate with others:\n\nEveryone needs to realize that negotiations are not inherently bad.",
  "Paul hopes to circumvent this hurdle by having Kentucky hold a separate presidential caucus before it holds its regular primary for all other offices.",
  "He endorsed a balanced budget amendment, congressional term limits and requiring members of Congress to read legislation before they vote on it.",
  "The enemy is radical Islam and not only will I name the enemy, I will do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind!",
  "That sparked talk that Paul might be modifying his foreign policy stance with an eye toward telling primary voters what they want to hear.",
  "His Republican rivals may point out that his proposal included ending aid to Israel, an idea that probably has few fans in the GOP ranks.",
  "Some commentators think that Paul’s social media skills give him an edge in reaching new constituencies, particularly younger voters.",
  "The younger Paul once told Reason magazine:\n\nI’ve heard from people who love my dad who don’t like some of the positions I’ve taken.",
  "In all, he says that Americans should be more worried about the country’s national debt than on what it is spending on the Pentagon.",
  "So he supports international trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.",
  "So my reason for signing onto the letter, I think it reiterates what is the actual law, that Congress will have to undo sanctions.",
  "He would have authorized the use of force for just one year and severely curtailed the White House’s ability to use combat troops.",
  "Indeed, he calls himself “libertarian-ish.” The question is how well that worldview will sell with more traditional Republicans.",
  "He supports economic sanctions against Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, but he is not looking to bring Ukraine into NATO.",
  "To note just one example, he has used Twitter to accuse Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) of wanting to “build a moat” around Cuba.",
  "(As anyone familiar with the Flying Fish case knows, Congress has the power to limit how U.S. military forces can be used.)",
  "So expect a Republican primary with some fireworks–and a test of the claim that Americans are souring on internationalism.",
  "The trust [but] verify is required in any negotiation, but then our goal always should be and always is peace, not war.",
  "I envision an America with a national defense unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by overseas nation building!",
  "The younger Paul is quick to argue that America’s overseas activities have often failed to advance American interests.",
  "He argues:\n\nIf you insist on unconditional surrender as a prerequisite to diplomacy, there will be little diplomacy.",
  "Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration and is now tripling under Barack Obama’s watch.",
  "Others accuse him of “trolling” and say he is not displaying the gravitas Americans expect in their presidents.",
  "If Paul’s tweets should ever become controversial, he has one obvious out: he doesn’t write most of his tweets.",
  "He instead cites Henry Kissinger’s advice that Ukraine “should function as a bridge between” Russia and Europe.",
  "He is not a clone of his father, Ron Paul, who ran for the presidency in 1988 on the Libertarian Party ticket.",
  "In talking about the national debt he argued that:\n\nBoth parties and the entire political system are to blame.",
  "At first glance, that might seem surprising given his skepticism about the use of U.S. military force abroad.",
  "Might Paul come to rue his staunch defense of Congress’s foreign policy powers should he become president?",
  "Not surprisingly, Paul called for a smaller federal government that taxes less, spends less and does less.",
  "President Obama never invested in relationships with Congress, and the same is true of his foreign policy.",
  "His rivals are calculating on the opposite happening, and will use his foreign policy views against him.",
  "But we also need a foreign policy that protects American interests and encourages stability, not chaos!",
  "Let’s quit building bridges in foreign countries and use that money to build some bridges here at home.",
  "He blamed the “Washington Machine” for most of the country’s problems:\n\nWashington is horribly broken.",
  "Kentucky GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have approved the plan.",
  "One thing stands in his way: Kentucky law forbids candidates from appearing twice on the same ballot.",
  "But he also knows that being seen as an isolationist is a kiss of death in modern American politics.",
  "The elder Paul’s unbending non-interventionist philosophy put him well outside the GOP mainstream.",
