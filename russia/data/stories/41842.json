  "The Cleveland-based real estate investment trustâ€™s shares rose as much as 13.23 percent to $22.68 in afternoon trading, their biggest intraday percentage gain in more than six years.",

  "The potential price under discussion is close to the range of $25.00-$25.50 per share, the report said.",
  "The company declined to comment, while Brookfield did not respond to an email requesting comment."
