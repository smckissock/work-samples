  "One group of investors, however, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on Facebook's declining stock — which is under pressure after news broke over the weekend that Cambridge Analytica, a political-research company, had accessed 50 million Facebook user profiles illegitimately.",
  "And what's more, their positioning in the months leading up to the data breach proved to be prescient, as they boosted short interest by more than $1.5 billion — or 48% — since the start of December, according to data compiled by the financial-analytics firm S3 Partners.",
  "And those traders who boosted Facebook short interest in recent months as a hedge, rather than an outright directional bearish bet, can rest easy knowing the damage to their profit-loss statement could've been far worse.",
  "Considering Facebook shares are still up a whopping 26% over the past year, it's going to take a lot more than one weak day for long-standing short sellers to recoup past losses.",
  "The fortunate ones are the so-called short sellers, or investors wagering that a stock price will drop; they are basking in Facebook's decline of as much as 6.1% on Monday.",
  "The stock is still down just 10% from a record high reached in early February, stressing just how rare profitable periods have been for bearish skeptics.",
  "Business Insider / Joe Ciolli, data from S3 Partners\n\nStill, the bounty most likely reaped by Facebook short sellers must be put into context.",
  "Getty Images / Justin Sullivan\n\nMonday has been rough for Facebook shareholders, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and bullish tech traders as a whole.",
  "Those bearish speculators held $4.8 billion of Facebook stock short heading into the company's share skid.",
  "But Monday's turmoil is a great starting point, and it should allow them to capture some quick profits.",
  "Short interest in Facebook climbed in the months leading up to the data breach."
