  "And, of course, we can see, just in what's come out in the last month, why that investigation is probably closer to the beginning than the end, with these e-mails about that Don Jr. meeting, three of the top Trump campaign people meeting with representatives of the Russian government, effectively, who are promising dirt as part of -- quote -- \"the Russian effort to help your father,\" to help Donald Trump, as well as clear intent by the campaign, Don Jr. saying that he would love that kind of help.",
  "TURNER: I want the people do decide and that's what we do --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I'm asking you as a Democrat -- as somebody who wanted -- I understand that but somebody who want a Democrat or a liberal to be in the White House would you rather run against Donald Trump or would you rather run against --\n\n\n\nTURNER: I'm hoping we'll have a candidate that can beat either President Trump or whoever they put up to run against.",
  "SCHIFF: Well, you know, we saw this during the campaign, that the Russians use their paid social media trolls, they use bots in order to push things as part of their active measures campaign, in that sense to try to influence the election, in this sense to try to potentially influence the firing of a top Trump campaign -- or not campaign, but Trump administration official, the national security adviser.",
  "Of course, Michael Flynn, the allegations not only include payments potentially from Turkey, but also the payments he received from R.T., these -- and other Russian entities, whether they were allowed, whether they violated the Emoluments Clause, were they properly disclosed, but, more broadly, whether it shows an intent to work with the Russians in way -- ways that are contrary to law.",

  "So, that means, one year later, rather than turning that investigation off, rather than concluding, we have looked at this for a year, there's really nothing to see here, as the president would claim, instead, if these allegations are true, it's moving into a new phase, with the impaneling of a grand jury, so that special counsel can subpoena witnesses and documents.",
  "JOHNSON: Well, what I'm hoping is the bill that senators Perdue and Cotton introduced possibly combined with my own guest worker visa program managed by the states, combined with what Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin are doing will start a serious discussion in terms of what we need to do in terms of fixing our incredibly broken legal immigration system.",
  "And you will recall that, before it happened, I was saying, you should be very cautious about this and that I thought we had the professionals necessary already inside the Department of Justice to do this kind of investigation, because special counsels, at times, historically, have felt the need to produce something in return for their appointment.",
  "And that's why we're talking about increased treatment, increased medication-assisted treatment, making sure that we interdict fentanyl and some of these other drugs at the border as they come in, and strengthen our ability to do that, and to work on education to try to prevent people from starting this before by educating their doctors.",
  "TAPPER: Republican staff members for the committee you're the top Democrat on, the House Intelligence Committee, traveled to London earlier this summer to try to speak with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence agent who, of course, compiled that dossier of allegations of possible Russian ties to Trump's campaign.",
  "And I think that's -- everyone will be better served by that, including the people of the country who actually want their government to work and do something about fixing health care, reforming the tax system, rebuilding our infrastructure, all the things that the president talked about during the campaign.",
  "And again I continue discussions on health care as well as taxes with my colleagues even though we're not in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about these farmers because President Trump is throwing his weight behind legislation that would cut legal immigration in half over the next decade.",
  "REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Oh, we're certainly looking at all of the conduct of Michael Flynn, in the same way, I think, that the special counsel may be viewing the same evidence, in terms of what it -- what light it will shed on the broader Russian investigation.",
  "Of course, the most important thing, I think, for our investigation and Bob Mueller's, is to figure out what happened before that, because there was obviously a backstory to that meeting and that exchange of e-mails, and, even more important, what happened after that.",
  "So, the Russians may well have concluded from that meeting their help would be welcomed, and this was the best way, through these cutouts like WikiLeaks and DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 to assist the campaign without putting the campaign's fingerprints directly on it.",
  "But it's particularly significant, I think, in terms of the Mueller investigation, inasmuch as, if General Flynn was shown to have violated the law in other ways, it would be an incentive for him to cooperate more broadly with the Mueller investigation.",

  "And I think the Democrats -- we have to give an aspirational economic message to these communities to say, you can have opportunity in the 21st century, that we haven't forgotten you, that we want to harness your talent and hard work.",
  "TAPPER: My understanding, by the way, the reason she has that job is because the Trump campaign wanted to reward South Carolina's lieutenant governor, who had been a big supporter of the president --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Henry McMaster, yes.",
  "TAPPER: So, \"The Wall Street Journal\" broke the news this week that special counsel Robert Mueller has been using a grand jury in Washington, D.C., to investigate Russia's interference in the U.S. election and any possible collusion.",

  "The Don Jr. meeting with someone billed as a Russian government attorney who had dirt on Hillary Clinton, we only found out about that a few weeks ago, but it took place more than a year ago in June 2016.",
  "But, certainly, there are elements of that meeting that have added, I think, substantiality to our understanding of both what the campaign's intentions are, but also in terms of the Russians' tradecraft.",
  "TAPPER: Let's talk about one of the issues the president talked about during the campaign and this week, President Trump this week embracing a proposal to cut legal immigration in half within a decade.",
