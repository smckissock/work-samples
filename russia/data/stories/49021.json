  "But progressives, by and large, you know, and when the senator says, health care, I think we're going to disagree on that, to the extent that I do agree that health care is the thing but Medicare for all is what is needed and I hear that all across the country, the data shows that.",
  "It was a week of high-profile firings in Washington that ended with\n\n\n\nex-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe getting pushed out after FBI disciplinary officials recommended his firing for leaking and for a lack of candor during its internal investigation.",

  "The thing that Donald Trump does and has done and I think will continue to do, if he continues to do what he did today, is really energize the other side.",

  "I believe, when it comes to this issue, we need as much transparency as possible to make sure it wasn't politically motivated.",
  "And I will be looking for her to understand that the law has changed and she cannot engage in these interrogation techniques.",
  "TAPPER: You have also said that you're actively considering whether or not you're going to challenge President Trump in 2020.",

  "This was the case where it stood out for his language and I think he thought, enough is enough with the firing.",
  "He's very much in the mainstream as a Republican, someone you would expect the Republican to pick for this job.",
  "So it was very hurtful to lump all Ohioans and all people -- in politics, we should not criticize the voters.",
  "Instead of looking at what actually happened, the process within the FBI, that recommended that he get fired.",
  "GALLAGHER: -- or on the wrong side of history, it not only misreads history, it misreads the present moment.",
  "If there wasn't a wave out there, as good a candidate as Conor Lamb was, he wouldn't have won that district.",
  "You have talked a lot about the need for privacy, not only by -- from the government, but from corporations.",
  "Joining us now is a Republican senator with a very different take, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.",
  "I really think that it -- the power is so unlimited that it's worrisome for the people on the receiving end.",
  "And so if you order a pair of shoes line, you will -- those shoes will pop back up if you didn't pick them.",
  "Which is what would also keep her in leadership, in her position, because nobody is going to challenge her.",
  "TAPPER: All right, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, it's always good to see you, sir.",
  "I helped write the Detainee Treatment Act with Senator McCain, been a military lawyer for 30 over years.",

  "You believe that he was fired because President Trump put pressure on the Justice Department to do so?",
  "I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is waiting to see who might be fired next.",
  "And so I don't think you really want people who are eager for war to be running the State Department.",
  "Will the new secretary of state who is more aligned with president's world view have greater success?",
  "I think the president going in the weekend before actually got our side a little bit more energized.",
  "Do you have any concern about the way that President Trump personally has politicized Andrew McCabe?",
  "TAPPER: Let's get to those new nominations by the president for secretary of state and CIA director.",
  "But, beyond that, do you think that -- that the president is laying the groundwork to fire Mueller?",
  "I don't think the person running that agency should be someone who ran a secret prison in Thailand.",
  "[09:55:02]\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I'm very disappointed with the attorney general, but we will see what happens.",
  "That's a separate issue than the Mueller investigation of the Trump Organization regarding Russia.",
  "There's no way in the world that she should be running our spy agencies, with all of their power.",
  "So, this goes to a real reform question, not just the politics of the day, but a reform question.",
  "TAPPER: This round's loser is Rex Tillerson beat out at the buzzer by Trump loyalist Mike Pompeo.",
  "And that is that nobody be should be left to their own devices, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page.",
  "And it would take actually a majority, I think, in this case to actually stop their appointment.",
  "And Mr. McCabe, the Office of Professional Responsibility, has recommended that he be dismissed.",
  "So, there's a certain amount of personal information, but it's consistent with your agreements.",
  "President Trump's picks for secretary of state and CIA director could face confirmation fights.",
  "Number two, he's got -- he's got to continue to try to work to deliver for the Republican base.",
  "So I don't think that nationally it is in the best interest of Democrats to run more centrist.",
  "Because he's somebody who goes out and marches or protests or goes on television all the time.",
  "TAPPER: What do you say to your good friend about why the Senate should look beyond her story?",
  "TAPPER: A Republican vowing to do everything in his power to block President Trump's nominees.",
  "But, at the time, the Bush administration viewed it as an authorized interrogation technique.",
  "What I saw at the FBI and the Department of Justice regarding the dossier really bothered me.",
  "TAPPER: Whoever you're backing it does look like the final contest will be a Russia showdown.",
  "It looked a little different, it was shaped a little differently, but you know those voters.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: What's your response when you hear her talking like saying that?",
  "I think that she's somebody who doesn't get nearly enough credit for making health care law.",
  "And people asked me recently, should there be one for McCabe and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?",
  "Joining us now to talk about this and much more is Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona.",
  "And I would just hope that enough people would prevail on the president now, don't go there.",
  "And so I think Pompeo really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat or to be the chief diplomat.",
  "And I would urge the administration, particularly President Trump, to sanction more people.",
  "TAPPER: Nina, let me ask you, because Conor Lamb, he didn't run as a progressive Democrat.",
  "One, see if we can recruit young 9/11-generation veterans on the conservative side to run.",
  "And what does it mean when you say you're going to do everything you can do to block them?",
  "So, I don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that.",
  "And that's why what I have been advocating is for is a bigger reform to a bigger question.",
  "You have said you haven't made a decision, it's not likely, but you -- it is on the table.",
  "I'm not ruling it out, but I certainly am -- I think the odds are long that I would do it.",

  "TAPPER: -- anything can happen --\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please welcome Stormy Daniels.",
  "I think they have too much power and too much power to go far afield of the question.",
  "GRAHAM: I think he's an outlier, Senator Paul, certainly within the Republican Party.",
  "Well, maybe his hardcore base likes it, but the rest are like, why is he doing this?",
  "I think most people who worked with him and know him would assume he's a Republican.",
  "TAPPER: Although keep in mind in March Madness --\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We want winners, right?",
