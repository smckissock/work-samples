  "State Treasurer John Chiang (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDespite pleas from relatives of those killed in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, the state retirement board on Monday rejected a proposal by California Treasurer John Chiang to consider divesting from retailers who sell assault weapons.",
  "Chiang’s motion was defeated by the Board of Administration for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, with nine members voting in opposition and three in support.",
  "Opponents of the motion said divestment would take away their ability as major investors in retail firms to affect store policies on the sale of assault rifles.",
  "“We have found engagement is a better alternative in order for us to accomplish something in this arena.”",
  "“We obviously have a significant problem in this country,” said board member Bill Slaton.",
  "But, he added."
