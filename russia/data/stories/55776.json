  "It was a curious confab at which to find Rohrabacher, who is still overheard at cocktail parties telling people that he “helped kill more Soviet soldiers than anybody else I know.” In a previous lifetime, the congressman and his Reaganite friend, Jack Wheeler, used to issue another kind of toast—“FTC!”—every time they clanked beers: “Fuck The Commies!” According to Wheeler, the two even conspired to get the code on the Soviet Union’s diplomatic license plates changed to “FC” for “Fucking Commies!”\n\nYet here was a new Rohrabacher in a new Russia, offering up his heart.",
  "More than anyone in Congress, he has become a reliable defender of the Russian point of view, whether it has to do with NATO expansion (“not thoughtful in creating a better relationship with our former enemy”), the inadvisability of economic sanctions (“instead of doing it that way, we should be making an all-out effort to create dialogue”) or the current hostilities in Ukraine, which Rohrabacher says were precipitated at least in part by Western meddling (“I don’t think we should blame all this on Russia”).",
  "The Russian president criticized American exceptionalism and wrote that an American-led strike against the Syrian regime, to which Russia was supplying weapons, “could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.” He also solemnly counseled, “The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not.”\n\nIn February 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and soon took over the Crimean Peninsula.",
  "Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP\n\nA former FBI agent who went “undercover” on Wall Street posing as a mob-connected trader, Grimm was indicted last year on 20 counts of fraud and perjury charges stemming from his ownership of a Manhattan restaurant called Healthalicious; in December, he pleaded guilty to one felony charge of filing false tax returns for the restaurant and announced he would resign from Congress.",
  "“I think if we had areas of better cooperation with Russia, we could have averted a relationship that is now on the rocks,” says Rohrabacher, who nods to Putin’s “many flaws” but also thinks the United States “should not be trying to antagonize him.” “Over the years we have minimized the areas of cooperation and maximized efforts on things that could be viewed as belligerent by Russia,” he says.",
  "Seagal has popped up in many strange places in recent years—with Brazilian martial arts fighter Anderson Silva, claiming to have imparted knockout wisdom; on a tank with Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, crashing through a man’s wall in a misguided attempt to prevent animal cruelty—but acting as a fixer for a congressional delegation to Russia might be his most eye-popping cameo.",
  "The FARA disclosures show that a lobbyist sent an email to “Mitch Wadman [sic], National Security Advisor to Senator [Trent] Lott.” Ketchum’s description of the interests or policies the lobbyist sought to influence consisted of one word: “Russia.”\n\nDisclosures by Ketchum and its lobbyists show very little activity for the millions they got paid.",
  "Amid December’s Russian ruble collapse, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov openly blamed Washington for his country’s troubles, saying there were “very serious reasons to believe” that the United States is pursuing a regime change strategy to topple Putin—aided and abetted by Rohrabacher’s colleagues on Capitol Hill.",
  "If you look at the U.S. Congress,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, “eighty percent of them have never left the USA, so I’m not surprised about Russophobia in Congress.”\n\nThe flacks and lobbyists have had a difficult assignment, of course: Spin must accord in some measure with reality to be effective.",

  "Ketchum distributed company statements and a newsletter, put content on social media platforms and, oddly, began sending out press releases for the Kontinental Hockey League, whose president at the time was Alexander Medvedev, the Gazprom honcho who failed to meet with Kerry and Lugar on his trip to Washington.",
  "… Well, Putin has a right to watch out for the interests of the people there.”\n\nRohrabacher seems to see in Putin, for all his faults, qualities similar to those of the man he once worked for—a leader who restored national pride after a period of defeat, humiliation and political tumult.",
  "Even more surprising is Seagal’s reinvention as a Russia expert, via Rohrabacher: In 2013, Rohrabacher refused to hold a hearing on Russia for his subcommittee in part because Seagal was unavailable as a witness, according to a source familiar with Rohrabacher’s association with Seagal.",
  "At a time of worsening tensions, escalating sanctions and a crashing Moscow market, when, more than ever, the Russian leader could stand to have a few friends in the American capital, his old arm-wrasslin’ buddy, a man viewed by many as colorfully erratic, may be the best ally he has.",

  "Since his heyday, Washington lobbying has turned into a multibillion-dollar enterprise in which much of the stigma attached to shilling for the unsavory has dwindled or been anonymized by big firms of lawyers and spin doctors; they are selling services these days, not salvation.",
  "One lobbyist who worked for the Russians here—and didn’t want to be named for fear of professional backlash—crudely likened his role to “trying to polish a turd.”\n\n***\n\nThe meetings took place inside the Kremlin, but not the Kremlin of gilded salons and gorgeous frescoes.",

  "Both Venable and Alston & Bird may have earned their pay in other ways—by providing political analysis of legislation and news events, for instance—but whatever they were doing, they were not lobbying Washington, at least in any disclosed way.",

  "For a hearing on the Ukraine crisis before his subcommittee on July 29, 2014, Rohrabacher picked as a witness Anthony Salvia, the executive director of the American Institute in Ukraine, a little-known nonprofit.",
  "He had been belting out ditties and downing vodka shots in an Italian restaurant of the Hotel Ukraina, one of Moscow’s iconic Seven Sisters, the ornate Stalinist buildings that help define the city’s character.",
