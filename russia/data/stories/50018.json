  "\"You start to realize â€¦ how important it's going to be for the future of the world that we police these things well, that we take it very seriously and put real resources against solving the problems now that you're at this scale,\" said Systrom, speaking Tuesday evening at the WSJ Tech D.LIVE conference in Laguna Beach, California.",

  "\"In an era when you can distribute information widely to the world very, very quickly and amplify it, what happens when you think some political figure said something they didn't?\"",
  "In particular, Systrom highlighted \"deepfakes,\" which are highly-believable doctored videos that are beginning to make their way onto social services.",
  "Since leaving Facebook alongside his Instagram Co-founder Mike Krieger, Systrom has not shared many details about his reason for leaving.",
