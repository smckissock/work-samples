  "At one point, Comey did say that he would address some of Grassley’s concerns about the dossier “in a classified setting.”\n\nThat exchange went thusly:\n\nGRASSLEY: The FBI and the Justice Department have provided me material inconsistent answers in closed setting about its reported relationship with Mr. Steele, will you commit to fully answering the questions from my March 6 and April 28 letter and providing all requested documents so that we can resolve those inconsistencies, even if in a closed session, being necessary?",
  "As you know, I briefed you privately on this and if there’s more that’s necessary then I’d be happy to do it privately.”\n\nGrassley continued: “Have you ever represented to a judge that the FBI had interaction with Mr. Steele whether by name or not regarding alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia prior to the Bureau launching its investigation of the matter?”\n\n“I have to give you the same answer Mr. Chairman.”\n\nGrassley asked several more questions about Steele, drawing a similar response from Comey.",
  "The questions about alleged FBI payment to Steele stem largely from a February Washington Post article reporting that after being paid to compile opposition research on Trump by the billionaire’s opponents during the election, Steele “reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work, according to several people familiar with the arrangement.”\n\nUltimately, the FBI did not pay Steele, the Post reported.",
  "At the hearing yesterday, Grassley referred to his letter and pointed out that “most of these questions have not been answered, so I’m going to ask them now.”\n\nHe continued: “Prior to the Bureau launching the investigation of alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, did anyone from the FBI have interactions with Mr. Steele regarding the issue?”\n\nComey replied, “That’s not a question that I can answer in this forum.",
  "The Post continued:\n\nCommunications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steele’s now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories, congressional inquiries and presidential denials, according to the people familiar with the arrangement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.",
  "Regarding Steele’s dossier, Morell stated, “Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can’t judge the information — you just can’t.”\n\nMorell charged the dossier “doesn’t take you anywhere, I don’t think.”\n\n“I had two questions when I first read it.",
  "And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you’re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, “Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,” because they want to get paid some more.",

Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the controversial, partially discredited 35-page dossier alleging collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.",

  "…\n\nMorell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20.",
  "The document was drafted by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who worked for a firm that was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump.",
  "The dossier reportedly served as the FBI’s justification for seeking court approval to clandestinely monitor Carter Page, who has been identified as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump.",
  "The dossier contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the widely-mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed.",
  "In March, the BBC reported the document also served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.",
  "I have subsequently learned that he used intermediaries.”\n\nMorell continued:\n\nAnd then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation?",
  "He is a New York Times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio.” Follow him on Twitter @AaronKleinShow.",
  "GRASSLEY: Was the FBI aware – was the FBI aware that Mr. Steele reportedly paid his sources who in turn paid their sub sources to make the claim in the dossier?",
