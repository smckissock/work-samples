  "On March 20, Schneiderman announced that he and his Massachusetts counterpart had opened a joint investigation in the Facebook-Analytica scandal, and had written to Facebook to demand answers.",

  "The firestorm has raised new awareness on how personal data is stored and shared by internet platforms and marketers.",
  "\"We're digging in on this,\" Schneiderman told reporters Thursday.",
  "\"Thus far they have said they want to be cooperative.",
  "They've already begun to produce documents.",
  "So they're moving pretty quickly.\""
