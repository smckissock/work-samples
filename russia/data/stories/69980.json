  "Instead, as the first anniversary of the games approaches, at least two of those oligarchs are quietly dumping their toxic assets on the state — forcing taxpayers to pick up the bill.",
  "Two key investors have unloaded properties built for the Olympics at a combined cost of $3 billion, a spokesman to Russia's deputy prime minister confirmed to The Associated Press.",
  "Vekselberg's investment vehicle Renova has not announced the deal, and its representative was unavailable for comment, but Dzhus, the government spokesman, confirmed the sale.",
  "But it made unwanted history as well, becoming a symbol of how some of the plans for President Vladimir Putin's $51 billion Winter Games went terribly wrong.",
  "The cost of the facility soared from $40 million to nearly $300 million — an overrun that caused the businessman involved to flee a corruption investigation.",
  "A much-touted $8.5 billion rail link between the Black Sea coast and the mountains is all but suspended, due to a dispute over who will pay for maintenance.",

  "According to Kasyanov, the thinking goes: \"I'd rather lose what I have invested, my own 15-30 percent, but I would not have to pay out the rest in loans.\"",

  "The risks for Putin are magnified as the country enters recession and rainy-day funds dwindle, even as Russia prepares for staging the 2018 World Cup.",

  "For the oligarchs, it's a way to recoup billions of dollars as they struggle in an economy battered by plunging oil prices and Western sanctions.",
  "A plunging ruble also means the price of building materials will soar, causing the World Cup to far exceed its original budget of $20 billion.",
  "In addition, other oligarchs may now be waiting for the right moment to demand their reward or compensation for taking on Sochi projects.",
  "\"They don't have any good options here,\" Sam Greene, director of King's Russia Institute at King's College London, said of the Kremlin.",
  "But the key is that by giving the ski jump and the ski resort to the regional government, Sberbank is washing its hands of the loan.",
