  "Van der Zwaan was drawn into the saga in 2012 as his law firm prepared to release a report commissioned by Manafort and Gates for Ukraine's Justice Ministry in a bid to defend then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had jailed one of his most prominent political opponents, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.",
  "Former Skadden Arps lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, 33, pleaded guilty in February to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with former Trump campaign official Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik, a suspected Russian intelligence operative who worked closely with Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
  "Defense attorneys said he lied to Mueller's team because he feared being fired if Skadden found out he had recorded work-related conversations without permission, including at least one with former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig, a Skadden partner who oversaw the Tymoshenko report.",
  "Schwartz complained to the judge Tuesday that prosecutors mentioned the father-in-law in their pleadings, although they made no direct claim that the family connection influenced van der Zwaan's decisions to withhold documents and lie to investigators.",
  "However, Mueller's team told Jackson that, in the words of an unnamed witness, van der Zwaan had \"gone native\" and began communicating about the report with Gates, offering talking points for the Ukrainian government in advance of its release.",
  "In addition to the 30-day sentence, Jackson also imposed a $20,000 fine and two months of probation, but she said she would permit van der Zwaan to reclaim his passport and leave the country as soon as his month in custody is completed.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nAttorneys for van der Zwaan pleaded with U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to forgo any prison time, give him a fine and let him return to his London home by August, when his wife is due to give birth.",
  "During an interview at the special counsel's office in Washington on Nov. 3, 2017, van der Zwaan sought to play down his interactions with Gates, who had been indicted just days earlier, according to prosecutors.",
  "Special counsel Robert Mueller obtained the first sentence in his high-profile investigation Tuesday, as a Dutch attorney who admitted to lying to investigators was ordered into federal custody for 30 days.",
  "Van der Zwaan said falsely that his last contact with Gates was in August 2016 and consisted of \"an innocuous text message,\" when he knew the two had been in touch more recently, Mueller's team alleged.",
  "She credited him for supporting himself and his wife in recent years, although she noted that van der Zwaan's father-in-law has provided funds to the couple since the attorney was fired from his job.",
  "Prosecutors also said van der Zwaan told investigators he did not know why Skadden had no record of an email between him and Kilimnik, when in fact he had not turned over the message to the firm.",
  "\"I'm not really moved by the complaint that he is in his hotel room with nothing to do,\" the judge said, saying he was not in custody and could have been doing community service to keep busy.",
  "One of van der Zwaan's defense attorneys, William Schwartz, argued that leniency was appropriate given the impact of the episode on the Dutch lawyer's family and on his legal career.",
  "The Dutch attorney also gave a draft copy of the report to a public relations firm working with Ukraine, contrary to instructions from senior attorneys at Skadden, prosecutors said.",
  "The judge said Tuesday that she would recommend that, but federal policies usually dictate that a sentence of less than six months be served at a halfway house or at the D.C. jail.",
  "But Jackson was largely unmoved by those arguments, noting that van der Zwaan came from an upbringing of privilege and lacked any hardship that could have mitigated his actions.",
  "Van der Zwaan is married to the daughter of a Ukrainian-Russian energy mogul, German Khan, whom Forbes ranks 138th on its list of billionaires, with a net worth of $9.3 billion.",
  "Jackson also rebuffed Schwartz's argument that van der Zwaan's freedom was curtailed in recent months as he spent his days at a \"residential hotel\" awaiting legal proceedings.",
  "Weissmann said that concern about the consequences at Skadden could have been part of the explanation, but there was \"reason to doubt that is simply the sole motive.\"",
  "The fact that prosecutors are not requiring future cooperation from van der Zwaan suggests that they don't see him as a crucial player in the Trump-Russia saga.",
  "\"The expressions of remorse, even those made on his behalf, were somewhat muted to say the least,\" the judge declared shortly before she imposed the sentence.",
  "\"I was stunned to see a gratuitous reference to his father-in-law as an oligarch in their papers, as if that has some bearing\" on the case, Schwartz said.",
