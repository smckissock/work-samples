  "The 2015 installation by the British artist Phyllida Barlow is a pertinent symbol of our turbulent times — an epoch of #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, marches for women and in defense of science, and demonstrations against gun violence.",
  "FRANKFURT — A sea of 100 multicolored banners in the atrium of the Schirn Kunsthalle here, roughly assembled using plywood, fabric and adhesive tape, provides the first indication that this art gallery is in protest mode.",
  "Held down with red and orange sandbags, Ms. Barlow’s banners are devoid of slogans or symbols, which serves this topical, ultracontemporary, international exhibition well.",
  "“Artists are asking some very fundamental, very interesting questions,” Martina Weinhart, the curator of the exhibition, said in an interview.",
  "The show, called “Power to the People,” focuses on the universal subject of politics in art, not on the political issues themselves.",
  "Its achievement is that it takes a step back and shows how art can reflect our political world.",
  "“We don’t want to answer them — we want to raise them.”"
