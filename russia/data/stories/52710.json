  "Trump must be close to pulling back that curtain and exposing the “ petty men ” who “peep about to find [themselves] dishonorable graves.”\n\nAt that moment in Helsinki, for Mr. Trump, the question of choosing between Vladimir Putin (ex-KGB despot) and Mr. Trump’s own experience of being set up, framed and relentlessly persecuted by the American “intelligence community” to this day, must have felt like the choice between Scylla and Charybdis.",
  "Even more important, according to Mr. Comey’s own memos leaked to the New York Times, combined with Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice’s “note to self” within minutes of Trump’s inauguration, we know that Brennan, Clapper, Obama, Comey, Rice, counter-terrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and Vice President Biden, met in the Oval Office just before Comey went to brief the president-elect.",
  "As the chief judge of the super-secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court found in an opinion heavily redacted but unclassified last year, the Obama/Comey/FBI’s rank abuses of raw surveillance data of Americans extend back to 2015 (when Trump announced—if not further).",
  "Sidney Powell, former federal prosecutor and veteran of 500 federal appeals, is the author of “LICENSED TO LIE: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice.” She is a senior fellow of the London Center for Policy Research and senior policy adviser for America First.",
  "Then there’s Director of National Intelligence [DNI] James Clapper—the second Trump-loather only recently departed from the top of the “IC.” Mr. Clapper is the guy who had the NSA collecting all possible data on all Americans and then lied to Congress about it.",
  "Each of the president’s remarkable accomplishments — from unprecedented high employment, our booming economy and the tax cuts to his historic summit with Kim Jong-un — highlights their abject failures and serves to prick their narcissistic egos.",
  "The court found egregious Fourth Amendment violations by the FBI and that it had given private contractors (probably Fusion GPS—Steele dossier creators—and Clinton-connected CrowdStrike) wrongful unlimited and unsupervised access to that data.",
  "Aside from the fact that former CIA Director John Brennan does not even attempt to conceal his loathing of Trump, it was none other than Brennan who had the CIA spying on members of Congress —indeed the entire Senate Intelligence Committee.",
  "She got him fired from his new position as President Trump’s national security advisor, had FBI Agent Strzok ambush Flynn in an interview, and McCabe may have helped tee him up with false allegations for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "Ironically, while Brennan is coming apart at the seams over Trump’s progress in a diplomatic relationship with Putin, it is Brennan who supported a communist —voting for Gus Hall as none-other than president of the United States.",
  "We wouldn’t want to omit Susan Rice, Obama’s national security advisor, who tripled the unmaskings of Americans during 2016 — grossly abusing the government’s surveillance apparatus to target the political opposition.",
  "Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and Yates, aided by others in the “intelligence community” more recently including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, obtained multiple FISA warrants to spy on members of the Trump team.",
  "Not only did they decide to limit information about Russia to be shared with the incoming team, they dispatched Comey to set up Mr. Trump for the media explosion of the entire false narrative and Steele dossier.",
  "That remarkable setup, by the highest members of our “intelligence community” and Obama himself, sparked the media firestorm of the Trump-Russia-collusion lie that has besieged the Trump presidency to this day.",
  "Either would destroy him, and no matter what he said, the Left would shriek the sky is falling yet again\n\nIndeed, one must wonder if our president really feels there is anyone he can trust.",
  "Discoveries of his innumerable venomous expressions of hatred for the president “clouded ” the Clinton email investigation and compelled his removal from the Special counsel team.",
  "We know that there are many honorable, dedicated and legitimate members of our multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies who strive to protect us the right way every day.",
  "The court so distrusted the FBI itself that it took access away from it, and NSA Director Admiral Rogers proceeded to eliminate the use of “about queries” completely.",
  "In their choreographed cries of contempt for Mr. Trump, the “left’s” increasingly shrill proclamations of political apocalypse make “Chicken Little” look rational.",
  "The frenzied furor and fomented outrage over President Donald Trump’s reluctance to express blind trust for our “intelligence community” defy reason and reality.",
  "Comey’s briefing provided the very “news hook” they all knew the media wanted to run with the existence of the unverified, Clinton-bought-and-paid-for dossier.",
  "He ran to his car to write down the details of the conversation, then he reported to Clapper and possibly Brennan, one of whom leaked it to CNN.",
  "The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.",
  "Comey “ executed the session just as [he] had planned .” He dropped the bombshell of only the “salacious” details of the Steele dossier.",
  "Don’t forget Peter Strzok — the FBI’s lead investigator for the “intelligence community”— hardly the epitome of trustworthiness.",
  "Strzok is the epicenter of the Clinton email “investigation,” the Russia narrative, and the Mueller team until last July .",
  "Sally Yates, of course, used those unmaskings to set up General Michael Flynn who was simply doing his job.",
  "All those applications were based primarily on the Clinton-bought-and-paid-for Steele dossier of lies.",
  "On January 6, 2017, on instructions from Clapper, Comey met one-on-one with Mr. Trump in Trump Tower.",
  "Power is the only thing leftists worship, and they are unraveling in front of our eyes without it.",
  "So, why might any of us not just declare blind trust for our “intelligence community” writ large?",
  "At least we’ve moved on from the impending annihilation from the nuclear war with North Korea.",
  "Even worse, they are desperate to keep their countless crimes and abuses covered up.",
  "Cross our intelligence community and they have six ways from Sunday to pay you back?",
  "Cities and states they control are criminal sanctuaries and bankrupt cesspools.",
  "Strzok is the self-avowed despiser of Trump and any possible Trump supporter.",
  "Even more egregious conduct compelled his physical removal from the FBI.",
  "Now we know how the-man-behind-the-curtain keeps Schumer in line.",
  "That’s not an endorsement of trust, but rather of fear.",
  "Surely, there were others in the Agency who helped him.",
  "The country is doing better without them every day.",
  "Indeed, that was its purpose—if not impeachment.",
  "Check out San Francisco, Portland and Chicago.",
  "How many like Brennan are still there?",
  "What was it Senator Schumer said?",
  "They have no policies that work.",
  "That alone drives them insane.",
  "They can’t control Mr. Trump.",
  "Let me count the ways.",
  "And there’s more.",
  "I almost forgot."
