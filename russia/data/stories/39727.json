  "Sazerac is now building a distillery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where city officials expressed concern after the Barton 1792 warehouse collapse and said future warehouses \"should be built with higher standards than the older whiskey barrel warehouse that recently collapsed in Kentucky,\" according to the Murfreesboro Daily News Journal.",
  "There were no uniform building standards at all for barrel warehouses before 1980, when Kentucky adopted the International Building Code, and distilleries aren't required to upgrade old buildings to current code unless they're doing a major remodel.",
  "In 2010, at the urging of distillers who wanted to simplify new construction permitting, the state for the first time added uniform requirements specific to bourbon warehouses, said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distiller's Association.",
  "More: Hundreds of fish killed in leak from bourbon warehouse collapse\n\nNone of the warehouses were equipped with automatic sprinklers and the cause of the fire was never determined, according to a 2009 report from the Loss Prevention Symposium.",
  "“These distillers are in the business of making bourbon … they more than anyone want to make sure it is safe.”\n\nMcCoy is also a member of the Legislature's bourbon trail caucus, which promotes bourbon-related tourism and supports the industry.",
  "“They take their neighbor's safety paramount.”\n\nAmy Preske, a spokeswoman for Sazerac, the parent of Barton 1792, said all of its warehouses were inspected by a third-party \"expert in barrel warehouse construction\" following the collapse.",
  "Why wouldn’t we be?”\n\nBig bourbon, big danger\n\nThe city of Bardstown, with 13,000 residents and at least six major distilleries that include big names like Jim Beam, Barton 1792 and Heaven Hill, is the \"Bourbon Capital of the World.\"",
  "June 23, 2018 Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal\n\nBarton 1792 collapse shows loose regulations on bourbon warehouses\n\nBardstown resident Tyree Matthews' backyard view is of one of the many distilleries that surround his neighborhood.",
  "In the aftermath of the warehouse collapse, the Courier Journal found that buildings where Kentucky distilleries age their products can go decades without independent inspections for structural weaknesses or safety issues.",
  "More: Your Kentucky bourbon could be threatened by Trump's new tariffs\n\nBardstown has seen three major bourbon blazes since 1996, but local fire officials say their main response plan is to \"turn on the hoses and show up.\"",
  "A similar Barton 1792 warehouse about 600 yards away collapsed in two stages in June and July, sending more than 4,500 tons of wood and flammable booze — equal to nine fully-loaded Boeing 747s — crashing to the ground.",
  "\"The structural design standards currently in effect and the heavy-construction materials available today are much improved from a safety, strength, and structural integrity standpoint,\" said Huddleston.",

  "More: Thousands of bourbon barrels spill from collapsed warehouse in Kentucky\n\nMore: Weeks after first collapse, rest of a Kentucky bourbon warehouse topples\n\n“I lost confidence,” Matthews said.",
  "Bardstown and Nelson County officials can't say for sure, but they think it was built in the “1940s or 1950s.” They have no record of its construction nor anything to show it was ever inspected.",
  "About 50 distilleries, some older than Kentucky itself, are a huge part of the economy — an $8.5 billion industry providing 17,500 jobs in a region that never seems to have enough of them.",
  "At seven stories, the wood-frame structure will look like its other, much older warehouses, but it will have fire suppression sprinklers and modern electrical, heating and cooling systems.",
  "No one was hurt in the collapse — no one lived close by — but it started Matthews thinking about the consequences of 18,000 barrels of whiskey landing on his neon-blue ranch-style home.",
  "Bardstown Fire Chief Bill Mattingly described his department's efforts as reactionary, with a response plan still in the early stages of development 20 years after Heaven Hill burned.",
  "In May 2003, Bardstown took on the special distinction of doing all code enforcement inspections for distilleries anywhere in Nelson County, said County Judge-Executive Dean Watts.",
  "But Steve Porter, a land use and environmental protection attorney who has represented numerous Louisville residents in claims against businesses in their neighborhoods, disagrees.",

  "But even basic safety measures like berms aren't required for countless warehouses built before the 1996 fire, Logan Spaulding, Nelson County's head of code enforcement, said.",
  "“Flames jumped more than 100 feet high, and burning alcohol flowed into a creek, which firefighters dammed so the blaze couldn’t spread,\" the 2009 Loss Symposium report said.",
  "That would be Bardstown-based Buzick Construction, where president Donald Blincoe estimates his company has built at least 100 barrel warehouses in Kentucky and Tennessee.",
  "Everyone knows a chemical plant poses a hazard, but not everyone realizes industrial production of distilled spirits can be just as dangerous when something goes wrong.",
  "Elliott, Mathews and Mattingly said they haven't heard anything from Barton 1792 or Sazerac about the structural integrity of the warehouses that loom over their homes.",
  "While alcohol production is closely monitored by state and federal regulators, they focus on tracking sales, collecting taxes and enforcing food and drug regulations.",
  "And local officials who proudly profess love for the local industry are at a loss when asked if the manufacturing process poses a risk to public health and safety.",
  "That leaves the folks in Maple Hill, where Matthews and dozens of others live in homes that snug up to the old distillery, unsure about the places they call home.",
  "Sam Huddleston, an environmental engineer who will oversee code enforcement for the project, told the Daily News Journal that newer warehouses are simply safer.",
  "Louisville Courier Journal\n\nWhile nearby residents and workers were panicked and shocked by the warehouse collapse, Blincoe said he believes few are in danger.",
