  "Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters\n\nRepublican California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is reportedly not happy with the indictment this week of a Russian national and gun rights activist with ties to the National Rifle Association.",
  "Facebook/Maria Butina\n\nButina, meanwhile, has been cultivating her own ties with American gun-rights activists, like Republican strategist Paul Erickson, who she has been acquainted with since at least 2013.",
  "The indictment says Butina worked at the direction of a high-level Russian government official who was previously a member of the Russian parliament and later a top official at the Russian Central Bank.",

  "Butina allegedly told this person that the Russian official was \"very much impressed by you\" and that the \"Russians will support the efforts from our side.\"",
  "The official is not named, but the description fits Alexander Torshin, a Russian gun-rights advocate and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "The affidavit lists another individual, \"US Person 2,\" described as a US citizen who was included in a series of email communications in 2016 and 2017.",
  "Rohrabacher told Politico he was part of that delegation and that he could be the congressman referenced in the indictment, but that he wasn't sure.",
