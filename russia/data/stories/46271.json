  "In fact, when Facebook rolled out platform changes in 2014 that removed the ability of apps to harvest friend data, media reports of the time noted the especial impact it would have on campaigns, with Yahoo originally titling one article “Facebook slams the door on political campaigns.” In its announcement of the changes, Facebook itself acknowledged user concerns over how their data was being shared without their knowledge, conceding that “we've heard from people that they're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.”\n\nIn the case of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook claims that the company acquired Facebook data from an academic who had collected it for academic research, while the Obama campaign has been careful to emphasize that the campaign itself collected the data, rather than receiving it from a third party.",
  "In all of the media coverage, policymaker statements and public conversation of the Cambridge Analytica situation of the past few days, there seem to be four major allegations of concern emerging: 1) millions of users had their information harvested who did not consent to it being collected, 2) an academic transferred data collected for academic use over to a commercial enterprise in violation of Facebook’s rules, 3) the company did not delete the data when asked to do so by Facebook and 4) that profiles compiled from that data were so powerful that they changed the outcome of the election of the most powerful person on earth.",
  "Going dark from social media today is like saying you are going to give up using the web: it’s a feel-good thought to toss around, but the way our modern world is designed, it is becoming more and more difficult to fully free yourself from the tentacles of social media and even those that do are still tracked around the web via embedded tools from the services, while your data is being compiled by data brokers and sold to companies like Facebook even if you never touch a computer or smartphone.",
  "As I’ve recounted again and again and again, academia is a particular vulnerability for Facebook in that university researchers tend not to understand or adhere to licensing and copyright law when it comes to accessing and sharing data, while the institutions that employ them have largely codified policies that exempt them from the precise kinds of legal agreements that govern the use of Facebook’s data.",
  "That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.” Or, as one of the campaign’s data leads put it, “We ingested the entire U.S. social graph … We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape.",
  "Moreover, even the coverage that has acknowledged the broader commercialization of our data has largely focused on Silicon Valley, rather than the vastly larger ecosystem of companies that buy and sell our most intimate data every day, assembling profiles that even Facebook itself purchases to track us offline and ensuring that even those that “#deletefacebook” will still be tracked without mercy.",
  "Thus, when it comes to the concern that millions or tens of millions of users had their data unwittingly and potentially unwillingly harvested in bulk simply because someone they were connected to on Facebook granted permission, there is nothing here that is any different than 2012 or indeed different from any of the countless companies that relied on this feature to promote their apps.",
  "In short, when you stare down at your phone using Facebook, behind your screen are millions of data scientists staring back up at you, clipboards in hand, recording everything you do, building rich psychological profiles of you that you have no right to control or even view and using all of that data to exert invisible control over your life in an infinite number of unseeable ways.",
  "Countless companies offer similar psychological profiling tools of social media users, typically based on Twitter data, but academics have focused extensively on estimating extraordinarily sensitive (and in some countries extremely dangerous) attributes about unwilling and unwitting users on Facebook, while the company itself experiments on its users like lab rats.",
  "Herein lies one of the most frightening aspects of the whole story: Facebook’s suspension of Cambridge Analytica is, according to Facebook, not because of the existence of the dataset of 50 million users or what was done with it, but rather that under its terms of service, the company was required to have collected the data itself, rather than buy it.",
  "While I personally have never seen any data or products from Cambridge Analytica, I have been subjected to myriad product pitches from an uncountable number of firms offering the same kind of psychological profiling, influence and targeting products and the results I’ve seen have been nothing short of worthless in terms of indicators and accuracy.",
  "Putting this all together, the narrative that has emerged is that of an academic researcher who legitimately gathered data on 50 million people with the full knowledge and consent of Facebook, but who the company claims went rogue and handed the data to a commercial firm that didn’t delete it on demand (though the company denies this).",
  "The increasingly blurred boundaries between academic and commercial research at US institutions means that in future a Cambridge Analytica could simply hire a university to conduct its work using data they had collected for academic research and be entirely within Facebook’s terms of use (since no data is being “transferred”).",
  "Moreover, despite the original harvesting mechanism being disabled, researchers, academic and corporate, all across the world are harvesting material from Facebook at this very moment using any number of different tools, making it all but impossible for Facebook to stem the flow of information from its platforms.",
  "From breathless headlines just a few years ago of “masterminds,” “dream team” and “groundbreaking,” social media data miners are now described using adjectives like “exploited,” “misuse” and “surveillance.” Does this represent the beginning of something bigger, perhaps the end of social media analytics?",
  "Given that our obsession with “fake news” and “filter bubbles” sprung into being as direct outcomes of how the press and public digested the election outcome, that is certainly a possibility and would suggest that the current maelstrom of negative coverage will soon pass with little long term impact.",
  "Our personal, private and sometimes highly sensitive daily life activity is already bought and sold in bulk by a nearly uncountable number of companies and Facebook itself partners with some of the largest to integrate their wealth of holdings on our offline lives that occur beyond Facebook’s reach.",
  "What’s notably missing, however, is what precisely will count as “suspicious” activity that the company will audit and what precisely it will do about the unknown ocean of data collected and distributed by the academic world – the very narrative that is at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story.",
  "The company itself has acknowledged that the initial harvesting of unwitting users’ data from the platform was entirely permissible at the time and that it was well aware of and approved the activity, both for the dataset under discussion and the work of the Obama campaign.",
  "While Twitter data still reigns supreme as the dominant social dataset for data mining due to its machine friendly API, Facebook data is widely used, especially for more sensitive kinds of demographic and psychological profiling due to its more intimate place in our lives.",
  "It appeared to have helped Donald Trump sell a political vision of division and antipathy.” Could it be that the public is suddenly worried about Facebook’s influence because they see it as the only possible explanation for an election they cannot otherwise understand?",
  "This raises the crucial unspoken question that no-one seems to be talking about: what about the myriad other repositories of Facebook data that have been collected by academics, governments and companies over the years, many of which are openly advertised for download?",
  "The actual reality is that that living room has a one-way mirror to millions of data scientists across the world observing all of that behavior and using it to model and even manipulate us based on activities we never truly understood were being observed to target us.",
  "At the end of the day, the public and press focus has cast this as an isolated incident by a few bad actors (though Zuckerberg’s statement acknowledges that there could be many more groups), rather than an indictment of the broader field of social media analytics.",
  "The sheer number of developers that build apps that have access to Facebook user data is so vast that the company could not possible audit them all (the company promises to audit “suspicious” apps without giving further detail as to what warrants that label).",
  "When I asked Facebook for comment on whether it would be reaching out to demand that other large archives of Facebook data delete their holdings (including the remnants of the Obama campaign) or restrict access to them, the company did not respond to comment.",
  "Government agencies, local businesses, schools, clubs, public transportation and public safety agencies and nearly every other organization you interact with today likely will at some point tell you to visit their Facebook page for some piece of information.",
  "Moreover, as the academic world is increasingly vocal about demanding access to Facebook data and the company begins to work more closely with academia, it is likely that the number of repositories floating around will only increase, rather than decrease.",
  "Indeed, just days before the Cambridge Analytica announcement, researchers on one prominent academic mailing list were lamenting Facebook’s improved privacy settings that limited the amount of data they could harvest at once and discussing workarounds.",
  "There is a lot here to unpack and most of it hinges on the specific license text that users agreed to when handing over their data, one’s definition of “academic research” and just what kind of data was handed over (if any) to Cambridge Analytica.",
  "It is truly astonishing that data on 50 million people could be compiled and the only thing Facebook says is wrong is that they acquired the data from someone else and then didn’t delete it when asked, rather than collecting it themselves.",
  "Academia in particular is filled to the brim with data collected from Facebook - some collected through formal informed consent, but much of it scraped at will without any notification to the users’ whose information has been archived.",
  "One of the most intriguing elements of the Cambridge Analytica story is just how much public sentiment has turned against social media and especially social media analytics in just four years and just who \"owns\" our digital personas.",
  "After all, you can buy a database of 4.7 million “Suffering Seniors” with medical ailments over the age of 55 for pennies per name or a list of 10 million diabetes sufferers, complete with a free price quote - no need for Facebook.",
  "To put another way, an incomplete and unknowably large cross-sectional archive of Facebook exists scattered across the file servers, databases, cloud accounts and personal laptops of university researchers all across the world.",
  "Indeed, it is important to remember that Cambridge Analytica is just one small firm in a vast world of companies that offer highly sophisticated user profiling and influence services to companies and governments every day.",
  "Facebook has emphasized that this bulk export capability was disabled years ago and so this will never happen again and thus their defense has been not to worry, this was a one-time issue that can’t be repeated.",
  "Assuming that Facebook data did indeed play some role in Cambridge Analytica’s work for the 2016 campaign, it is important to remember that Ted Cruz’ campaign used the same data and it didn’t end well for him.",
  "(Though shortly ago Zuckerberg alluded that the company would be examining \"suspicious\" apps that had used its bulk harvesting capabilities, though no mention of bulk scraping or non-API harvesting).",
  "Most large social analytics firms offer some kind of Facebook analysis, typically through Facebook’s own anonymized data offering or geotagged user-level feeds like that formerly used by Geofeedia.",
  "If Cambridge Analytica had run the original personality app itself, there would have been absolutely nothing Facebook could have done to halt its use and there would have been no story here at all.",
  "Moreover, by creative use of ad targeting, very high resolution maps can be constructed of highly sensitive demographics without ever needing to download anything from Facebook or other platforms.",
  "The Obama campaign’s use of a very similar workflow to harvest data on millions of unwitting friends was, according to media reports of the time, both known by Facebook and fully approved by it.",
  "By Facebook’s reckoning, the only additional thing Cambridge Analytica did wrong was not deleting the data it had acquired when it promised Facebook it would (the company strongly denies this).",
  "Of course, Friday was not the first time Cambridge Analytica and its alleged use of Facebook data has been mentioned – those headlines came and went with little fanfare during campaign season.",
  "Indeed, Zuckerberg’s first statement on the matter largely passes the blame to Cambridge Analytica, though at least acknowledges how many other vast archives of Facebook data may be out there.",
  "Why is it then that we are so concerned about Facebook data being used for voter targeting when campaigns and companies have long bought a myriad other highly intimate data points about us?",
  "The ability of a single researcher to box up data on 50 million users and hand it over to a commercial company that allegedly failed to delete it is a harder problem for Facebook to solve.",
  "Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information.",
  "For all the talk of “#deletefacebook,” withdrawing entirely from the social media world will do nothing to stem the flow of data that is commercialized about each of you each day.",
  "This is perhaps the most interesting question and likely revolves around just how little consumers understand about all of the data that is bought and sold about them every day.",
  "When users communicate with friends and family on Facebook, they see it as a private living room in which they can have intimate and personal conversations amongst loved ones.",
  "As the Post summarizes, the campaign “built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API.",
  "Indeed, as Bloomberg notes, Facebook has weathered countless privacy furors over its tenure and each time the public eventually accepted the new order of things.",
  "Facebook itself computes a wealth of indicators about its users and purchases reams of commercially available information to complete its picture of each user.",
  "As I detailed on Monday, it was actually the Obama campaign that pioneered the mass harvesting of data from unwitting users on Facebook at a national scale.",
  "We scraped it all.” This was coupled with a wealth of offline data, including what individuals were watching in the privacy of their own living rooms.",
  "If we are truly concerned about privacy and ownership of our digital selves, we would do well to widen our conversation far beyond one single company.",
  "The vast “social media analytics” industry exists solely to mine all of this rich social data to help companies and governments make decisions.",
  "Just four years ago the use of Facebook data for voter modeling and manipulation was heralded as a heroic modernization of the campaign world.",
  "Even at the time the activity allegedly occurred, Facebook already required developers to sign legal agreements prohibiting such actions.",
  "Facebook is just one tiny piece of this massive ecosystem of data that commercializes us into products to be bought and sold.",
  "In short, if you collect it yourself, its fair game – you just can’t pay someone else to acquire the data for you.",
  "Why then are we suddenly talking about all of this in the same language used to describe cybersecurity incidents?",
  "Moreover, even those who genuinely want to give up social media entirely will find it difficult at best.",
  "After all, there is little to this story that Facebook can offer concrete solutions to.",
  "Perhaps, as Wired put it, “the data leakage hadn’t helped Unilever sell mayonnaise.",
  "Zuckerberg makes no mention of all this data in his statement.",
  "Congratulations Mark Zuckerberg, George Orwell would be proud.",
  "What does this mean for the future of analytics?",
  "Yet, all of this focus on Facebook is misplaced.",
  "Unlikely."
