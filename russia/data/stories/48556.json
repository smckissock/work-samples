  "But the meeting in Brussels ended with members of the European Parliament complaining that Mr. Zuckerberg had used the session’s odd format to evade specific questions and just repeat statements he had made in the past.",
  "European lawmakers barraged Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Tuesday with a litany of questions about his company’s global power, its role in elections and its misuse of user data.",

  "Before it descended into frustration, the meeting had been billed as part of Mr. Zuckerberg’s apology tour for Facebook’s mishandling of its users’ data.",
  "That left Mr. Zuckerberg only minutes to speak at the very end, allowing him to select which questions to address in a general way.",
