  "“We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s legal team, said on Saturday, just after The New York Times reported that the meeting took place.",
  "“Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,” said Corallo.",
  "“These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner.”\n\nJust days after that Trump Tower meeting, Steele would compile the first of 17 memos that make up the dossier.",
  "We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up,” Trump Jr. said.",

  "President Trump’s eldest son, his son-in-law and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer last June, it was revealed on Saturday.",
  "Since Magnitsky’s death, Browder has lobbied U.S. lawmakers to pass a law that makes it easier to impose sanctions against Russian businessmen involved in human rights abuses.",
  "He has said he is concerned about Fusion’s links to Democrats given that the FBI relied on the dossier for part of its investigation into potential Trump-Russia collusion.",
  "Veselnitskaya is affiliated with the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF), a benign-sounding non-profit group registered in Delaware.",
  "But Trump’s legal team is raising questions about the June 9, 2016, conclave and is suggesting that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, misrepresented herself.",

  "Trump Jr. said that he set up the meeting after being contacted by an unidentified acquaintance.",
  "Akhmetshin directly lobbied members of Congress on the adoption-sanctions issue last year.",
