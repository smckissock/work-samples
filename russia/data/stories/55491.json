  "These documents NIAC didn't produce — but that other parties possessed and were compelled to produce — included \"a discussion of legal restrictions on lobbying by nonprofits, emails Parsi wrote to a National Security Council director, emails coordinating a congressional briefing, communications NIAC exchanged with its expert about NIAC events on Capitol Hill and meetings with foreign officials, and 168 emails NIAC received from Iranian-Americans expressing negative views of the organization.\"",
  "\"We are disappointed that Judge Wilkins's opinion did not even address our primary argument: that Judge Bates overlooked his own ground rules for shifting the forensic-imaging costs, doing so even though Judge Bates determined that there was no evidence that NIAC had altered any of the disputed Outlook calendar entries and that he concluded that the entries Mr. Dai discovered through forensic imaging were not material to his summary judgment motion.\"",
  "Worse still, when the emails were eventually reviewed by the court in private, \"The court observed that many were plainly responsive to Daioleslam's requests for lobbying-related documents,\" and that \"When Daioleslam finally received the remainder of Talebi's emails, he noted they included Congress-related communications that he could have used in his depositions of NIAC's employees. \"",
  "This was false: \"The inventory showed that one of the computers NIAC had withheld as an 'intern computer' was actually used by [then-NIAC legislative director Emily] Blout, whose Outlook calendar entries NIAC had produced ... Another one of the 'intern' computers was actually used by NIAC's co-founder and former outreach director, Babak Talebi.\"",
  "NIAC expanded upon this defense — essentially that the court did not endorse Daioleslam's claims that NIAC was lobbying for the Iranian regime, thus eliding the fact that it was NIAC that brought the suit in the first place — in a statement published on March 5, roughly 24 hours after Business Insider first contacted Parsi for comment.",
  "\"After spending several million dollars, going through our computers, not only could they not find a shred of evidence supporting their lie that we lobby for the Iranian government, Mr. Daioleslam also retreated from his accusation against us in court and ended up paying for the vast majority of the costs for his fishing expedition.\"",
  "Judge Wilkins has only this to say about NIAC's possible motives: \"In view of the Appellants' failure to explain their withholding of so many relevant documents, some of which they misrepresented to the District Court that they could not locate, we cannot conclude it was clearly erroneous to find the Appellants acted in bad faith.\"",
  "After spending several million dollars, going through our computers, not only could they not find a shred of evidence supporting their lie that we lobby for the Iranian government, Mr. Dai also retreated from his accusation against us in court and ended up paying for the vast majority of the costs for his fishing expedition.\"",
  "In the decision, two circuit judges and a senior circuit judge forced NIAC to pay \"$183,480.09 in monetary sanctions\" to a blogger named Hassan Daioleslam to reimburse him for the money he's spent fighting a defamation lawsuit NIAC brought against him in 2008, and that was dismissed 4 years later.",
  "The Feb. 10 decision from the appeals court, written by judge Robert Wilkins, determined that NIAC had \"flouted multiple court orders\" and improperly delayed its delivery of documents to Daioleslam during the discovery portion of the lawsuit and even withheld certain documents.",
  "In that suit, NIAC alleged Daioleslam — who runs a website called Iranianlobby.com, along with the Iranian American Forum— had \"defamed them in a series of articles and blog posts claiming that they had secretly lobbied on behalf of the Iranian regime in the United States.\"",
  "If NIAC never wanted a federal judge to look over certain aspects of its operations — its member lists, internal emails, meeting schedules, and other documents the court deemed relevant to Daiolelslam's defense — it simply could have chosen not to bring a lawsuit at all.",
  "Judge Wilkins is unsparing in his assessment of NIAC's various evasions regarding the architecture of its record-keeping system: \"Its resolute failure to produce all relevant drives until over a year after it was first ordered to do so is inexcusable,\" the court found.",
  "UPDATE: Hassan Dai emailed the following to Business Insider in response to Trita Parsi's statements in this article: \"Twice in the article, Parsi claims that during the lawsuit, I retreated from my previous declarations that Parsi lobbies on behalf of Iranian regime.",
  "There's a major difference between lobbying on behalf of a foreign government — something that requires registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act — and advocating in favor of closer ties with a country on the premise that this would advance US interests.",
  "However, Parsi conceded in his first deposition two months later that NIAC had used Salesforce 'to keep track on members and donations' since before 2006 and that, 'for a few years, we used it as the database in which we kept our membership information.'\"",
  "As Wilkins' decision recounts, \"References to 'SF' in NIAC's belated April 2010 production of some of its Outlook calendar entries tipped off Daioleslam that it had also withheld meeting notes and membership lists it kept in a program called Salesforce.\"",
  "Parsi disagrees: \"The real story here is that Mr. Dai [Daioleslam changed his name to Dai since the suit began] and his neoconservative supporters — whose intent was to 'destroy NIAC' — utterly failed,\" he wrote in an email to Business Insider.",
  "\"Again, NIAC failed to comply meaningfully with the court's order, producing only a list of 9,000 Convio [a business management program] 'transactions' — mostly donations — from which a complete list of members was impossible to divine.",
  "\"NIAC produced virtually no documents from Talebi's NIAC email address in response to Daioleslam's production requests prior to late December 2009, even though Talebi had been involved with the organization since 2002,\" Wilkins writes.",
  "But it made the worst possible choice: bringing a losing lawsuit, and then taking what the Feb. 10 finding describes as \"inexcusable\" action in court in an apparent attempt at protecting itself from the consequences of its own lawsuit.",
  "REUTERS/Rick Wilking The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) has emerged as one of the most influential foreign policy advocacy groups in Washington and has helped affect an almost complete reversal in US policy towards Tehran.",
  "We respectfully disagree with the decision that even a small minority of the discovery cost should have been shifted to us, but are content with the moral victory that Mr. Dai had to retreat from his accusation against us in court.\"",
  "He claimed that his organization had not acted in bad faith in its slow response to various court orders, and cited another judge's finding that NIAC's delays may simply have been a result of \"a lack of resources and carelessness.\"",
  "NIAC audaciously responded that it had no idea what Daiolelslam was talking about, with its lawyers claiming the group \"ha[d] not employed any such software or system and is therefore unable to comment about this unfounded claim.\"",
  "The US District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed, finding in 2012 that the work of NIAC president and founder Tritra Parsi was \"not inconsistent with the idea that he was first and foremost an advocate for the regime.\"",
  "Daioleslam (aka Dai), for his part, told Business Insider that the trial's discovery costs came out to a little over $300,000, which means that the $180,000 reward in fact accounted for over half the costs incurred.",
  "NIAC also misrepresented the extent of its Salesforce records when it first acknowledged their existence in September of 2010:\n\n\"NIAC told the District Court that it had only experimented briefly with Salesforce.",
  "(In an email to Business Insider, Blout, who no longer works for NIAC, wrote that \"While I am mentioned several times, I was not a party in the lawsuit and was not involved in NIAC's legal strategy or decisions.",
  "The court agreed with Daioleslam's claim that a list of NIAC's members was relevant to his defense, since the lawsuit hinged on allegedly defamatory and damaging statements about NIAC's nature and activities.",
  "\"Even Judge Bates, whose final ruling we respectfully disagreed with, still concluded that any alleged discovery failures on our end were \"a product of lack of resources and carelessness more than bad faith.\"",
  "That statement went on to point out that the judge who originally ruled on the case attributed its failure to produce documents more to \"a product of lack of resources and carelessness more than bad faith.\"",
  "During the trial, the NIAC provided inconsistent statements about its internal computer system and recordkeeping, and then used those later-disproved claims to drag out the discovery process for years.",
  "The court wasn't sure what criteria NIAC had used to hoard the remaining emails, holding \"in an April 5, 2011 order that NIAC had 'totally failed' to assess the Talebi emails for responsiveness.\"",
  "The statement notes that \"Some confusion has arisen as to the nature of the opinion filed by Judge Wilkins on February 10, 2015 in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\"",
  "(For example, the appeals court didn't uphold sanctions against Parsi for his mysterious alteration of the ICC document, finding there wasn't clear evidence he'd done so in bad faith.)",
  "\"At long last, in September 2011 — two-and-a-half years after Daioleslam's request for production of documents related to NIAC's membership — NIAC produced all its member lists.\"",
  "Daioleslam reasonably believed that emails from Babek Talebi, NIAC's co-founder and outreach director, could help establish the nature of the group's work and aid in his defense.",
  "The decision notes that \"The Appellants made no attempt to defend their failure to produce these documents other than to say Daioleslam had found no 'smoking gun' among them.\"",
  "Daioleslam has his own explanation for NIAC's actions: \"They didn't want to give the documents because didn't want to expose the truth, that's all,\" he told Business Insider.",

  "\"After the court ordered NIAC to search its servers, NIAC located about 8,000 of his emails, but produced only 89 as relevant, and withheld the rest as not relevant.\"",
  "The judge essentially found it was conceivable that NIAC could reasonably be accused of lobbying on behalf of Iran, so Daioleslam's blog posts weren't defamatory.",
  "In July of 2010, the court ordered NIAC to \"submit the server on which its Outlook calendars are kept to PricewaterhouseCoopers [\"PwC\"] for forensic imaging.\"",
  "\"NIAC failed for ten months to produce Outlook calendar records for any of its employees in response to Daioleslam's production requests,\" the opinion states.",
  "The court didn't buy the argument that they were \"irrelevant\" and ordered NIAC to turn over the rest of them \"consistent with [NIAC's] discovery obligations.\"",
  "This was also false, and as judge Wilkins notes, \"PwC's forensic imaging of NIAC's old server revealed hundreds of previously unproduced calendar entries.\"",
  "The court agreed, but NIAC delayed its release of the emails and then withheld thousands of them based on criteria that the court couldn't quite identify.",
  "\"One version of the FAQ that Parsi produced — the metadata of which showed it was last modified in 1999 —retained this description [as a \"lobby group'].",
