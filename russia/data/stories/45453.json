  "In an open letter, U.S. and European consumer protection groups still urged Zuckerberg to provide more “specific details on how the company plans to implement these changes.”\n\nZuckerberg's praise for Europe’s tough data rules — which have been considered detrimental to the company’s business model — may indicate either a real strategy change or, as some consumer protection groups fear, an effort to calm nervous lawmakers by promising eventual change that may or may not materialize.",
  "The Economist magazine, Britain’s leading free-market voice, similarly praised the law, writing that “the case for copying the best bits of the European Union’s approach is compelling.”\n\nStill, the European changes might have passed virtually unnoticed in the United States had they not coincided with revelations about the data-harvesting company Cambridge Analytica's collection of Facebook users’ personal data for political ends.",

  "European Union regulators have long been tougher on tech companies than their U.S. counterparts, forcing these companies to give users more control, imposing fines for noncompliance, and requiring platforms to spot and delete illegal content.",

  "As Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will continue to address U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday, his best bet might essentially consist of promising American users the sort of protection the company had to grant its European users.",

  "Facebook said last week that Cambridge Analytica may have obtained information on far more users — with about 20 percent of them estimated to be living outside the United States.",
  "In a separate revelation, Facebook also had to acknowledge last week that “malicious actors” discovered the identities and collected data on most of its 2 billion global users.",
  "The key question is whether Zuckerberg’s promises to implement European standards worldwide are genuine or a strategy to persuade U.S. lawmakers to leave the company alone.",
  "The Facebook chief executive may seek to use his appearances at the Capitol Hill hearings to further portray those promised changes as a willingness to self-regulate.",
