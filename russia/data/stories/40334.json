  "Nevertheless, the Iraqi news media took little notice of the convictions, perhaps because there are so many present-day traumas to cover: the fight against the Islamic State; a car bomb that blew up Tuesday morning near a Baghdad hospital, killing five people; and a bomb in the south of the capital that killed an additional seven civilians.",
  "The Blackwater killings joined two other high-profile atrocities, the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal and the massacre of civilians by Marines in Haditha, in destroying the credibility of the long American occupation in the eyes of Iraqis.",
  "Underscoring Iraqâ€™s seemingly never-ending traumas, the sentences were handed down at a time of renewed American military involvement in the country to fight the extremists of the Islamic State.",
  "Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Washington on Tuesday to meet with President Obama, and to ask for more weapons and airstrikes against the insurgents.",
  "This being Iraq, where notions of revenge and eye-for-an-eye justice run deep, many people felt the sentences were too lenient.",
  "Some of those interviewed here on Tuesday learned of the news from the BBC and the Arabiya television networks.",
  "But the sentences close a painful chapter for the Iraqis whose lives were upended by the tragedy.",
  "Many, including Mr. Khalaf, the traffic police officer, said the contractors deserved to die."
