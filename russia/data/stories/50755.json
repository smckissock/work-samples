Bob Hall, a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 83, said while introducing the bill before the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce on Wednesday — the same day Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said relations between the U.S. and Russia are “at a low point.” An EMP attack, Hall said, would be the “most debilitating to critical infrastructure because it has the ability to disrupt, disable and irreparably destroy electronics over a wide geographic area.”\n\n“For some, the threat posed by an EMP can be hard to conceptualize,” Hall added.",
  "Jacki Pick, another NCPA fellow, testified before the committee to “exhort the Texas legislature to take decisive action to protect and harden the Texas grid.”\n\n“I spoke at length with congressman [Trent] Franks and other members [of Congress] before coming here today and they definitely wanted me to let everyone know that even if everything they’re doing at the federal level were successful, it is not sufficient to protect the Texas grid and Texas should act unilaterally,” Pick said.",

  "Six members of the Texas state Senate, including members of both parties, are co-sponsoring legislation that — if passed — would begin taking steps to secure the state’s electric power grid from an EMP attack, an event that former CIA director James Woolsey and other national security experts have said is a real and credible threat both for Texas and for the country as a whole.",
  "The costs will be in the millions of citizens’ lives, and the economy of this state, of course, will be profoundly and perhaps permanently affected.”\n\nLess than two weeks ago, former CIA director James Woolsey wrote an op-ed in The Hill warning that the nation as a whole is vulnerable to an EMP attack by North Korea, which he says could kill 90 percent of Americans.",
  "“This bill would provide our state with a golden opportunity to ensure that when the lights go out in the rest of the country, they stay on in Texas.”\n\nThe bill would create a task force to assess vulnerabilities in the state’s electric grid and make recommendations on how to secure the grid against attack by September 1, 2018 at the latest.",
  "Dr. Peter Pry, chief of staff for the Congressional EMP Commission, testified in support of the bill, which he called “vital to the security of Texas as well as the nation.”\n\n“One of the things that’s new in the EMP world is the military doctrines of our potential adversaries,” Pry said.",

  "“Evidence suggests that North Korea even simulated an EMP attack in 2013.”\n\nGrantham was one of several national security experts to testify on Wednesday in favor of securing Texas’ power grid from an EMP attack.",
