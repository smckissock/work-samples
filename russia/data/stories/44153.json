  "Read more from The New York Times:\n\nGroups in Myanmar fire back at Zuckerberg\n\nFacebook's other critics: its viral stars\n\n'You are the product': targeted by Cambridge Analytica on Facebook\n\nIn his email, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had added \"dozens\" of Burmese language content reviewers to monitor reports of hate speech and had \"increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues,\" including a product team working on building tools to try to help stem the violence there.",
  "\"It's great that he's engaging personally with this, but the stuff he's talking about is really not that much different from what they've been saying for the past few years,\" said Jes Petersen, the chief executive of Phandeeyar, an innovation lab in Myanmar that has worked with Facebook to produce localized versions of its community standards.",
  "The civil society groups have already responded to Mr. Zuckerberg's reply, asking for hard data about Facebook's efforts in the region, including how many Burmese-speaking reviewers the company has, how many accounts the company has taken down in Myanmar and how long, on average, it takes for Facebook to respond to reports of hate speech.",
  "The activists, representing six civil society organizations, harshly criticized Mr. Zuckerberg in the letter, saying he had mischaracterized Facebook's response to violence-inciting messages in Myanmar and had not devoted sufficient resources to enforcing its hate speech rules in the violence-stricken country.",
  "We have also increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues and we now we have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg's email, which was provided to The New York Times by the activist groups, was the chief executive's first direct communication with the local groups that have criticized Facebook's role in the country's growing humanitarian crisis.",
  "Here is the full text of Mr. Zuckerberg's email to the civil society groups, followed by the groups' response:\n\nMark Zuckerberg's email\n\nDear Htaike Htaike, Jes, Victoire, Phyu Phyu and Thant, I wanted to personally respond to your open letter.",
  "Thank you for writing it and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues, including the September incident you referred to.",
  "Facebook is a dominant source of information in Myanmar, and civil society groups have accused it of being a kind of absentee landlord, with few moderators and systems in place to keep extremists from using Facebook posts to incite violence.",
  "Facebook has been accused by United Nations investigators and human rights groups of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims, a minority ethnic group, by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and false news to spread on its platform.",
  "The half-dozen signatories of the response include Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country; the Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity.",
  "Years after civil society groups first began flagging hate speech in Myanmar, the company still has no permanent office or staff in the country and seems to be struggling to give its platform sufficient oversight.",
  "Such incitement and scaremongering have become far too typical on Facebook, according to the groups, which say Facebook has repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to devote more resources to the issues.",
  "In making my remarks, my intention was to highlight how we're building artificial intelligence to help us better identify abusive, hateful or false content even before it is flagged by our community.",
  "In an interview last week, Mr. Zuckerberg appeared to hold up the September episode as a model of Facebook's effectiveness, and said the company's systems had detected the messages and stopped them.",
  "Last month, Adam Mosseri, Facebook's News Feed head, said in an interview that he and other Facebook executives \"lose some sleep\" over the possibility that Facebook had led to real-world violence.",

  "Mr. Zuckerberg wrote back to the group the next day from his personal email address, apologizing for misspeaking and outlining steps that Facebook was taking to increase its moderation efforts.",
  "\"I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues,\" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.",
  "We are grateful for your support as we map out our ongoing work in Myanmar, and we are committed to working with you to find more ways to be responsive to these important issues.",
  "In fact, the activists said, they flagged the messages repeatedly to Facebook, barraging its employees with strongly worded appeals until the company finally stepped in to help.",
  "There are several other improvements we have made or are making, and I have directed my teams to ensure we are doing all we can to get your feedback and keep you informed.",
  "These improvements in technology and tools are the kinds of solutions that your organizations have called on us to implement and we are committed to doing even more.",
  "The groups say the biggest obstruction to their attempts to push back against a torrent of dangerous hate speech is not their lack of resources but Facebook itself.",
  "A Facebook spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, confirmed the authenticity of Mr. Zuckerberg's email, and said Facebook was planning to continue engaging with the activists.",
  "Last week, after frustrated activists from Myanmar sent an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, they got something unexpected: a reply.",
  "In order to achieve the same ratio of users to moderators in Myanmar, Facebook would need to have around 800 reviewers in the country, Mr. Petersen calculated.",
  "For example, we are rolling out improvements to our reporting mechanism in Messenger to make it easier to find and simpler for people to report conversations.",

  "Activists in other developing countries have raised similar complaints about Facebook's behavior.",
  "\"I wonder how he spent those sleepless nights — because we didn't see that much change,\" he said.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg's personal email did not quell the activists' frustration.",
  "The messages warned Buddhist communities of an imminent Muslim attack.",
  "\"Dozens of content reviewers is not going to cut it,\" he said.",
