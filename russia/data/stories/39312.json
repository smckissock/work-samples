  "Trump Jr.'s decision to meet the Russian contact, my colleagues wrote, \"as well as the attendance of [Trump's son-in-law Jared] Kushner and then-Trump campaign aide Paul Manafort, amount to fresh evidence that the Trump campaign was willing to consider accepting help from a Russian source tarnishing Clinton.\"",
  "The emerging contacts led some to dub Moscow's project as the creation of a “Traditionalist International.”\n\n“The value system of Southern Christians and the value system of Russians are very much in line,” one prominent American intermediary with Moscow said to my colleagues.",
  "As I've written before, there is a clear ideological affinity between a segment of Trump’s supporters — as well as his inner circle — and the government of President Vladimir Putin, which has for a number of years sought to strengthen ties with far-right parties in the West.",

  "“The so-called conflict between our two nations is a tragedy because we’re very similar people, in a lot of our values, our interests and that sort of thing.”\n\nIndeed, Trump's “America First” rhetoric isn't all that different from the nationalism preached by Putin.",
