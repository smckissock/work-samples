  "Mike Schroepfer, the CTO, was answering questions from a member of Parliament, who asked whether Facebook read the terms and conditions for GSR, the app developer that later sold information on 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica.",
  "In that case, if an advertiser said, 'I would like to reach all the folks in the United Kingdom,' regardless of [the type of ad], you would be a candidate for that ad,\" unless you've chosen not to receive ads from that advertiser.",
  "Previously, Schroepfer told another lawmaker that Facebook users couldn't opt out of all political advertising, despite having what the company calls a large amount of control over what ads they see.",
  "Developers who want to see large amounts of data have to ask Facebook for permission and go through a review -- a change that took place in 2014.",
  "\"We require that people have a terms and conditions, and we have an automated check to make sure they're there,\" Schroepfer said.",
  "Stevens pressed him on whether Facebook read any terms and conditions of developers who put apps on the platform prior to 2014.",
  "It seems that Facebook doesn't either, according to testimony in the U.K. from the company's chief technology officer.",
  "Schroepfer explained that Facebook no longer allows developers the level of access to data that GSR enjoyed.",
  "Facebook's CEO has said he doesn't expect the typical user to read the company's terms and conditions.",
  "\"You can remove all the interests, if you want, and leave basic information: location, age, gender.",
  "\"I can't say we never read them; I think it wasn't a requirement that we read them,\" he answered.",
  "\"That's a pretty weak tool to stop people getting messages they didn't want,\" the MP shot back.",
  "\"We did not, we do not read all of the terms and conditions at the time.\"",
  "\"There isn't an opt-out for political advertising,\" he said.",
  "\"So you didn't read their terms and conditions?\"",
  "asked the member of Parliament, Jo Stevens.",
  "\"No.\""
