  "Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team has asked witnesses about Kushner’s efforts to secure financing for his family’s real estate properties, focusing specifically on his discussions during the transition with individuals from Qatar and Turkey, as well as Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to witnesses who have been interviewed as part of the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 election.",
  "Newsweek reports, “New York State’s Department of Financial Services last week sent letters to Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank and New York Community Bank requesting loan applications and processes, and information about the institutions’ relationships with Kushner and his business assets, a person familiar with the correspondence told Bloomberg in a report published Wednesday.”\n\nDeutsche Bank also gave Kushner a $285 million loan just before the election.",
  "(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nNBC News reports:\n\nFederal investigators are scrutinizing whether any of Jared Kushner’s business discussions with foreigners during the presidential transition later shaped White House policies in ways designed to either benefit or retaliate against those he spoke with, according to witnesses and other people familiar with the investigation.",
  "It is inconceivable that someone in this financial position, deeply indebted to foreign banks, would get a top-secret clearance (hence his downgraded status) but candidly it is hard to understand how he could be granted any clearance at this point or perform duties concerning financial lenders and/or governments that could affect his finances.",
  "Trump’s reliance on Russian money in the 1990s and 2000s, his more recent efforts to do deals in Russia, his refusal to utter a word of criticism about Vladimir Putin and his campaign’s multiple contacts with Russians raise precisely the same question about Trump that we have of Kushner: Whose side is he on?",
  "The Washington Post has reported that investigators are probing Kushner’s separate December meetings with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, and with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank, a state development bank.",
  "“But Jared couldn’t even get that right, with his official title being used in the campaign announcement in violation of the Hatch Act.” Eisen on behalf of the Committee for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint on precisely those ground.",
  "Just as keeping Rob Porter for so long signaled the White House really didn’t think spousal abuse was that big a deal, Trump’s retention of Kushner suggests that the president doesn’t much care if his inner circle is beholden to foreigners.",
  "He could not even fill out his financial disclosures and security clearance forms properly, with dozens of amendments being required.” He adds, “His contacts with the Russians and other foreign governments are deeply problematic.",
  "(The clearance classifications go to the risk posed by the material, but the individual’s susceptibility to foreign influence is relevant and potentially disqualifying for any level of clearance.)",
  "He must go before he does any more damage.”\n\nNews this week that Kushner received jumbo loans from two banks after meeting with Citigroup and Apollo Global Management highlights the risk he poses.",
  "Because he is so heavily indebted and still operates his real estate company, we cannot be sure whether performance of his White House duties are for his own benefit or the country’s.",
  "And because Kushner’s portfolio is so broad it seems unlikely he wouldn’t inevitably make some decision that affects his own financial interests and/or those of his lenders.",
  "It’s now painfully obvious he is there solely by nepotism and that the president knew or should have known about the security risks and conflicts Kushner brought with him.",
  "The Post reported last June:\n\nThe October deal illustrates the extent to which Kushner was balancing roles as a top adviser to Trump and a real estate company executive.",
  "If he meets with a bank executive, or representatives of one of the four countries attempting to influence there is at the very least the appearance of corruption.",
  "His security clearance has been downgraded to the level of a White House intern, making it impossible for him to do the jobs for which he is purportedly there.",
  "We now know that he has the worst ethics and conflicts issues of anyone in the administration with the possible exception of his father-in-law.",
  "After the election, Kushner juggled duties for the Trump transition team and his corporation as he prepared to move to the White House.",
  "Unless the White House is absolutely certain Kushner will not be indicted (and how can one be confident, let alone certain?)",
  "it would be far better for the administration if Kushner were an ex-White House adviser if Mueller drops the legal hammer.",
  "“A classic way to get rid of an unwanted adviser is to shove them out of government and into a campaign,” notes Eisen.",
  "Kushner apparently has no appreciation for the appearance of conflicts of interest, let alone actual conflicts.",
  "Kushner, of course, is not the only one in the White House with the potential to be influenced by foreigners.",
  "This revelation is just one aspect of the financial investigation involving the president’s son-in-law.",
  "It is possible that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is closing in on Kushner and his finances.",
  "All of this goes to the legal and ethical implications of his continued presence in the White House.",
  "To allow him to remain simply reaffirms the president’s comfort level with ethical malfeasance.",
  "“Kushner represents a total failure in every possible dimension,” says ethics guru Norm Eisen.",
  "“His appointment was a violation of the federal anti-nepotism statute.",
  "\n\nSenior adviser to the president Jared Kushner at the White House.",
  "And that has raised concerns from a variety of sources.",
  "However, the political ramifications are nearly as bad.",
  "How many other suspect meetings have been taken?",
  "Let’s remember he is in debt, lots of debt.",
  "What ones are planned?"
