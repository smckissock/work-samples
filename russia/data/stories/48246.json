  "FACEBOOK:\n\nStrengths:\n\nOver 2 billion users worldwide, way more than any other social network\n\nStill growing rapidly in developing nations where it’s often the main source of news\n\nOwns Instagram which is experiencing rapid growth and remains popular with Gen Z\n\nOwns WhatsApp which remains popular outside the US\n\nDominates online ad market along with Google\n\nHas massive amounts of data around users and their behavior both on and off the platform\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nGen Z has largely abandoned “Mombook”\n\nIssues with #FakeNews, fake profiles and Cambridge Analytica\n\nContentious relationship with advertisers who need to use the platform but hate the way they are treated by Facebook\n\nFacebook engagement is down and many expect it to continue to fall off\n\nStill struggling with its video service Watch\n\nIGTV on Instagram is still a question mark\n\nGRADE: B-\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMAZON:\n\nStrengths:\n\nDominates ecommerce market with no competitors in sight\n\nGenerally well regarded by customers in terms of customer service and overall product\n\nAlso seen as innovative and forward thinking\n\nPrime’s free two-day delivery locks customers into Amazon ecosystem\n\nExpanding into multitude of new areas (groceries, health care)\n\nTV division more robust than many realize, plan to serve as clearinghouse for multiple OTT apps seems to be paying off\n\nSports broadcasting rights will likely grow too as Amazon can add merchandising to the mix\n\nAlexa owns voice market thanks to early launch, decision to allow third party developers and well-designed, well-priced products\n\nBillion dollar ad market in an environment where users frequently can't/don't distinguish between Amazon content and Amazon ads\n\nData based on customer purchases seen as far more accurate and desirable by advertisers than data based on “Likes” (Facebook) or search (Google)\n\nAmazon Web Services dominates its market\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nOverrun by counterfeiters, primarily from China\n\nCounterfeiters also traffic in fake users and fake reviews in order to game the system and get “Amazon’s Choice” badge—undercuts confidence in Amazon platform\n\nPrime video in the browser is still not a good experience for users, decision not to uncouple it from main Amazon site (or at least give it a unique URL) remains puzzling\n\nMost likely to be dismantled by Congress as Amazon’s core business (retail sales) is the FAANG business most members of Congress actually understand.",
  "Still strong in PC market with MacBook product line\n\nStrong reputation for quality and good design\n\nExtremely loyal customer base\n\nStrong commitment to customer privacy that predates current controversies\n\nHuge cash reserves\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThree recent product launches—HomePod, Apple TV and Apple Music—have failed to achieve any sort of traction, let alone the market dominance Apple is used to—HomePod and Apple TV are dead last in their respective categories\n\nClosed ecosystem seems antiquated in 2018 and may prevent Apple from getting traction in new categories like voice and TV\n\nSecrecy around their plans for distributing their new TV content seems like a play from 2006, makes them seem out of touch\n\nMarket for iPads (and tablets in general) slowing down; Amazon’s Fire Tablets, at one-fourth the price, are gaining ground\n\nSiri has never recovered from early quality issues and lags behind Alexa\n\nApple Maps and other proprietary software (Pages, Keynote) continue to remain niche products with limited adoption\n\nCommitment to privacy has handicapped their advertising efforts\n\nPricing strategy seems to be backfiring as Apple TV and iPad lose out to much lower priced competitors (Roku, Amazon Fire)\n\nLoyal fan base seems concentrated in Boomer/X/older Millennials—younger Millennials and Gen Z don’t display similar passion for Apple and its products\n\nGRADE: C+\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNETFLIX\n\nStrengths:\n\nDominates subscription online video (SVOD) market, which it essentially created\n\nGlobal expansion has it in almost every country in the world, way ahead of other media companies\n\nHas proven adept at producing HBO-like high quality upscale programming\n\nHas signed Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy and other purveyors of quality mass market programming\n\nMovie division has been getting good buzz\n\nStarting to make reverse syndication deals (BoJack Horseman to Viacom)\n\nWell liked by customers\n\nLeadership team (Hastings and Sarandos) seen as forward thinking and innovative\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n$13B content spend is riskier than media is making it out to be: most new shows fail, Netflix is looking at short movie-sized windows in which to promote hundreds of new shows and it’s unclear how effective their storied algorithm will be even with a multi-billion dollar marketing spend.",
  "GRADE: B\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGOOGLE\n\nStrengths:\n\nDominates the search market with no real competitors in sight\n\nDominates online ad business based on ability to utilize user data obtained from search along with ad serving (Double Click) and related businesses\n\nStrong software business (Gmail, Docs, Chrome, Maps et al) which provides even more data that can be used to target advertising\n\nYouTube is a thriving business with no real competitors\n\nYouTube Live TV vMVPD product seems to be growing apace with entire vMVPD industry\n\nYouTube Originals have surprised the industry by producing quality programming\n\nHas largely avoided the opprobrium Facebook is getting around privacy\n\nInnovating on everything from cars to home automation to biotech\n\nSizable cash reserves\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nWhile data collection practices don't feel as invasive as Facebook’s, still getting pushback from GDPR and related privacy initiatives\n\nSuffers from “magpie syndrome”—focuses on bright shiny object (e.g., Google Plus, Google Fiber) and then quickly forgets about it\n\nAdvertising business is under attack from a range of parties including big media companies and new blockchain vendors\n\nGoogle Home is doing better than Apple HomePod but still not close to Amazon Alexa, especially in the popular imagination\n\nHas been unable to penetrate hardware market except for Chromebooks\n\nChromecast OTT device has fallen behind both Roku and Amazon Fire Stick\n\nLacks last mile connection to internet and is thus at mercy of broadband and mobile providers.",
  "“Comfort Food Factor”—getting audiences to watch familiar network shows like “The Simpsons” is much easier than getting them to watch a brand new series, especially at a time of peak content when they have many other choices\n\nUS networks and studios taking back much of their library content, leaving Netflix to rely on originals\n\nMovie catalog is weak\n\nVery narrow and easily disrupted business model compared to other FAANGs—relies on single revenue stream (subscriptions) until syndication business ramps up.",
  "GRADE: B+\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Notes\n\nWhile people often lump all five companies together, they have radically different business models, monetization schemes, internal structures and, as we have just seen, strengths and weaknesses.",
  "GRADE: A-\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAPPLE\n\nStrengths:\n\nDominates hardware market, particularly in mobile phones where market still breaks down into iPhone/not-an-iPhone (despite Samsung’s best efforts.)",
  "The one issue they are all facing is, ironically enough, a lack of any sort of last-mile access to the home--these internet companies are all reliant on someone else to deliver their product to users phones, laptops and television sets.",
  "Ability to penetrate non-Western markets (and many Western ones) still unproven—massive all-at-once expansion may prove to be a bad move (or genius, but jury is still out.)",
  "As users become more aware of privacy issues, Amazon may need to change marketing tactics\n\nAmazon Fire line and other non-Alexa hardware still also-rans to Roku and iPad.",
  "In fact, aside from the fact that they've all taken advantage of digital technology to dominate a certain piece of the market, they actually don't have much in common.",
  "Privacy issues and sinking stock prices have thrust the “FAANG” companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google into the spotlight this month.",
  "Does not own “last mile access” and thus must rely on MVPDs and other broadband providers who can make life difficult if they want to.",
  "In order to understand them better, here's a quick look at their various strengths and weaknesses as of summer 2018.",
  "Is there anything that rings false to you?",
  "Anything obvious I left out?",
  "Love to hear your opinions."
