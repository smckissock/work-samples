  "Brin has seemed dismissive of \"hypothetical situations\" in the past\n\nThe comments come as the tech industry, which represent the most valuable companies in the American economy, has come under fire for a variety of issues, including the collection and misuse of people's personal information (as highlighted by Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal), the spread of misinformation, propaganda and hate speech on services like YouTube, Google and Facebook, and a growing anxiety about our dependence on smartphones.",
  "Here's Sergey Brin's full 2017 letter:\n\nIt was the best of times,\n\nit was the worst of times,\n\nit was the age of wisdom,\n\nit was the age of foolishness,\n\nit was the epoch of belief,\n\nit was the epoch of incredulity,\n\nit was the season of Light,\n\nit was the season of Darkness,\n\nit was the spring of hope,\n\nit was the winter of despair ...”\n\nSo begins Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities,” and what a great articulation it is of the transformative time we live in.",
  "Sergey Brin, the cof0under of Google, stressed the need for caution, accountability and humility within the tech industry as its innovations become \"deeply and irrevocably\" ingrained in society, a striking shift in tone among a leader of the Silicon Valley business cohort famous for its certitude of its own righteousness.",
  "\"We can debate as philosophers, but the fact is that we can make cars that are far safer than human drivers,\" Brin said at a tech conference in 2014, when asked about the ethics involved in creating self-driving cars that must choose between hitting a pedestrian or a truck.",
  "Brin has been an important figure in the development of technologies once considered the stuff of science fiction, helping to shape the Google X labs where products like self-driving cars, face-worn computers and airborne delivery drones were born.",
  "The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.",
  "We’re in an era of great inspiration and possibility, but with this opportunity comes the need for tremendous thoughtfulness and responsibility as technology is deeply and irrevocably interwoven into our societies.",
  "In March, the first self-driving car fatality oc cured in Arizona when an Atmos Uber vehicle struck a pedestrian at night (human-driven cars are involved in more than 35,000 traffic fatalities per year in the US).",
  "The 44-year old Russian-born executive has at times shown himself to be dismissive of the public's concerns regarding potential impacts of technological advances, labeling some as \"hypothetical situations.\"",
  "In the annual founders letter released by Google-parent company Alphabet, Brin touted the far-reaching innovations in artificial intelligence, computing power and speech recognition in recent years.",
  "\"Most notably, safety spans a wide range of concerns from the fears of sci-fi style sentience to the more near-term questions such as validating the performance of self-driving cars.\"",
  "\"There are very legitimate and pertinent issues being raised, across the globe, about the implications and impacts of these advances,\" Brin said.",
  "In this sense, we are truly in a technology renaissance, \" Brin wrote in the letter published on Alphabet's investor relations site on Friday.",
  "But Brin said the tech industry could no longer maintain its \"wide-eyed and idealistic\" attitude about the impact of its creations.",
  "But he warned that tech companies have a responsbility to consider the impact of their advances on society, a change in tone.",
  "Advances in artificial intelligence, he said, represent the \"most significant development in computing in my lifetime.\"",
  "\"There is serious thought and research going into all of these issues,\" Brin wrote in the founder's letter on Friday.",
  "The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second.",
  "Computation Explosion\n\nThe power and potential of computation to tackle important problems has never been greater.",
  "Brin said artificial intelligence advances represent the most significant computing development in his lifetime.",
  "Eric Risberg/Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle cofounder Sergey Brin wrote Alphabet's 2017 annual Founders Letter.",
  "\"Every month, there are stunning new applications and transformative new techniques.",
  "Among these issues:\n\n\"How will they affect employment across different sectors?",
  "In the last few years, the cost of computation has continued to plummet.",
  "How can we understand what they are doing under the hood?",
  "How might they manipulate people?",
  "What about measures of fairness?",
  "Are they safe?\"",
  "Story continues"
