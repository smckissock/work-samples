  "You deserve each other!”\n\nTypical among those in a roundup on Huffington Post was this tweet from actress Marina Sirtis: “To all those asking for thoughts and prayers for the victims in #churchshooting, it seems that your direct line to God is not working.”\n\nSirtis’ Twitter profile, by the way, admonishes “Please let’s try to keep things civil.”\n\nThere was also Ira Madison III, who offered this tweet: “Prayers?",
  "It is intentional and quite focused: Faith in God is to be mocked, in particular Christian faith, and when Christians are slaughtered during a church service, that is the perfect time to pile on.”\n\nA militantly intolerant spirit increasingly animates the secular humanism that decades ago became the dominant creed among the elite denizens of America’s cosmopolitan coasts and urban islands.",
  "Conservatives point to LBJ’s “Daisy” spot against Sen. Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Fact Magazine’s headline a few weeks before that election, which screamed “1,189 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit to Be President!”\n\nIn fact, vicious libels masquerading as political rhetoric are nothing new in this country or any other with an even remotely free public debate.",

  "Rather than the traditional Judeo-Christian values and democratic liberty that informally distinguished the American republic for most of its history, the secular liberal elite’s culture now sets the dominant public tone and direction.",
  "What the f–k do you think they were doing in church, playing Connect Four?” Similarly, actor Wil Wheaton replied to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s appeal for prayer, tweeting “The murdered victims were in a church.",
  "It’s wasn’t the election of President Donald Trump even though the ocean of liberal outrage that followed that seminal 2016 upset continues uninterrupted today and shows no signs of abating any time soon.",
  "If prayers did anything, they’d still be alive, you worthless sack of sh-t.”\n\nThe rhetorical civility that once was the (mostly) governing standard of American public discourse has been gone for decades.",
  "Mention Buddha, Confucius, Muhammed or Vishnu and hardly anybody in a newsroom, on a campus or among corporate leaders gets bent out of shape.",
