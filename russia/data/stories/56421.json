  "SESSIONS: I won't repeat it, Mr. Chairman, but I hope the congressman knows and I hope all of you know, that my answer to that question, I did not meet with the Russians, was explicitly responding to the shocking suggestion that I, as a surrogate, was meeting on a continuing basis with Russian officials and the implication was to impact the campaign in some sort of nefarious way.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: So, again, underscoring the point, Sam, he goes from a full- throated, you know, I don't recall anyone in the Trump campaign having any kind of contact with the Russians, to, as I was just talking to Dana, OK with regard to, yes, there was a meeting in '16, Papadopoulos, that was the whole should or shouldn't candidate Trump meet with Putin.",
  "LIEU: On the video screen, show you a question from that form and it says, \"Have you or any of your immediate family in the past seven years had any contact with a foreign government, its establishment, such as embassy, counselor (ph), agency, military service, intelligence or security (INAUDIBLE), etc., or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S.?\"",
  "I've always done that to my bosses and supervisors, so -- you know, people are expected to be loyal to their Executive Branch head --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEU: The correct answer --\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: But if you --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n-- some sort of improper loyalty oath that goes beyond the commitment that --\n\n\n\nLIEU: Thank you, Mr.",
  "I remember that he suggested an ability to negotiate with Russians or others and I thought he had no ability or it would not be appropriate for him to do so and I was pretty clear about -- that he shouldn't be pretending to represent --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Were you equally clear with Mr. Gates at the June meeting?",
  "SESSIONS: Well, I was told by my executive assistant, when we did this form earlier and then again when I was nominated for attorney general, that the FBI authority said, members of Congress and effectively government officials meeting people on an official basis, you were not required to list all these contacts.",
  "One thing I will say is that if the president was able to watch aboard Air Force One or while they're refueling, he probably wasn't all that happy with Jeff Sessions' response to a Republican congressman trying to press him on the notion of a second special prosecutor in -- to investigate Hillary Clinton.",
  "Did you May 10th, 2017 memorandum instructing federal prosecutors to seek the most serious possible charges for criminal defendants and the longest possible sentences, extend to defendants who are charged by Special Counsel Mueller, like Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos and so on?",
  "GAETZ: So in this circumstance you contemplate, where senior prosecutors are doing the analysis of the issues raised in Chairman Goodlatte's letter, and then reporting back, do you contemplate, by using the conjunction \"and\" -- that you and Mr. Rosenstein would be briefed simultaneously?",
  "SESSIONS: We have not had a conflict in my term in office yet with the press, but there are some things that the press seems to think they have an absolute right to, they do not have an --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nRASKIN: (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: -- absolute right --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Thank you much.",
  "DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, because, look, I mean, for people who, you know, sort of don't follow the intricacies of testimony before Congress, if he says \"I don't recall,\" it gives him the sort of out, if you will, if he didn't -- if he's not right.",
  "General Sessions, the question today is, as you know, the current Special Counsel Investigation has revealed several high profile Washington elites, on both sides of the aisle, for example, Mr. Podesta, Mr. Manafort, who have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",
  "GAETZ: Well, let's go -- other than the matters that Mr. Mueller's dealing with, are there any other matters that you would, you would see a circumstance where the issue's been raised in Chairman Goodlatte's letter, where you would anticipate a recusal on your part?",
  "We actually had an argument about the Ukraine, because the day before the Ukrainian ambassador was in my office making his case against Russia and I raised those issues with Mr. Kislyak and he was, as I referred to it, I think, the classic, we did nothing wrong.",
  "A lot of pressure from even the chair of that Judiciary Committee, the Republican Goodlatte to -- for the Justice Department to open that second special prosecutor to start investigating Hillary Clinton and other things in the Obama administration.",
  "So I just want to -- you to be clear that as it relates to the Uranium One matter, you do believe you have the authority to appoint a special counsel and you do not believe that that authority that you have is subject to any recusal at this time.",
  "I'm trying to find out, on the very issues raised in Chairman Goodlatte's letter, on the very issues referenced in this response, it is stated in this response that it is the attorney general and the deputy attorney general that make a decision.",
  "You've taken the position that members of Congress having no standing to sue in federal court to challenge President Trump's continuing receipt of foreign government payments a the Trump Hotel, the Trump Tower, the Trump golf courses, and so on.",
  "Bush, highlighting failed attempts to reform the law in this area and this is despite repeated recommendations to develop a strategy integrated with the DOG's overall national security efforts and similar calls for higher means of enforcement.",
  "VINOGRAD: All of this back and forth between what Jeff Sessions does recall or doesn't recall or when Donald Trump Junior was or was not in touch with WikiLeaks accomplishes Vladimir Putin's goal of undermining confidence in our institutions.",
  "And as you know, that law created critical disclosure requirements for any lobbying group that works on behalf of foreign interests here in the U.S., so their advocacy and activities can be properly evaluated in light of their associations.",
  "What's interesting to me, Brooke, is that, you know, he said that he didn't remember the meeting with Papadopoulos when Papadopoulos mentioned -- broached the idea of the president meeting with Putin until he read about it in news reports.",
  "On September 5th, I led (ph) a letter to office with 17 other members from Louisiana and Texas, requesting a thorough investigation of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast actions, harvesting and transferring fetal tissue and for financial gain.",
  "LIEU: I submitted such a form when I served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force and the form requires you to certify, under penalty of perjury, that information submitted was true, complete and correct to the best of your knowledge.",
  "The point is that a lot of these things have stayed below the radar because there's not been appropriate focus and attention on it and the special investigation has brought that and in the view of many of us, it's long overdue.",
  "And so, Sam, let's just go back to Jeff Sessions and remind people -- got a lot of sound coming up -- remind people what Jeff Sessions said before on the -- any political Russia contacts with anyone in the Trump campaign.",
  "Question is, would you agree to work with us -- us, me and this committee to correct these very serious problems, so we can update our disclosure laws, so that the American people can see what's going on behind the veil?",
  "We've already reduced the backlog of some 400 letters by half and we're going to, when the dust settles on our time here, I think you'll see, we've far sur-, we're more responsive than you've had in the past.",
  "As Attorney General, our leading law enforcement official, what is the appropriate constitutional remedy for a President who collects foreign emoluments without obtaining congressional permission to do so?",
  "So during the -- your time on the campaign, did any person on earth state that they were communicating with Russians, traveling to Russia, or asked the campaign to meet with Russians, to your recollection?",
  "I believe our professional staff have been at this for some time, have communicated with some senators who've got ideas and have probably have communicated with you and I would be glad to continue that.",
  "But I -- let me back off of that to say I really have not followed that closely and I'm not, I do not have privy to the information and it would be inappropriate, really, for me to express an opinion.",
  "Third issue, I'm almost out of time, but October 12th you made remarks to the Executive Office for Immigration Review and you stated how the Immigration Court system is being gained in many ways.",
  "[14:05:14] But the fact that it's taking so long to come out, the fact that he was even there for that conversation, raises so many red flags considering the fact that this has become a pattern.",
  "There was another takeaway, Dana, and it was this, that Jeff Sessions dismissed the suggestions that President Trump has been trying to influence his Justice Department on any of its decisions.",
  "GAETZ: So I'm now going to quote, I think it's in the third paragraph, it says, \"The attorney general has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters.",
  "Is it your belief that Congress should act to enhance the Credible Fear standard and if we do that, what impact would it have on fraudulent and dilatory claims filed in Immigration Courts?",
  "SESSIONS: I would make the final decision, I would assume, unless there -- it implicates an issue that I'm not, ah, that I'm recusing, or it would be improper for me to be involved with.",
  "It's clear that if we just look at the facts, Donald Trump Junior, for example, was in touch with an organization that Mike Pompeo has called a non-state hostile intelligence services.",
  "This was very serious business for the founders of the country, who didn't want the President compromised by foreign government pay offs and by the intervention of foreign governments.",
  "These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general,\" when you say the \"deputy attorney general\" you're referring to Mr. Rosenstein?",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have been asked to remember details from a year ago, such as who I saw on what day, in what meeting and who said what when.",
  "Meantime, today, for the first time, Sessions, who was also a key official within the Trump campaign, had to face questions about this March 2016 meeting with George Papadopoulos.",
  "It simply calls for charging the crime, the most serious crime and --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nRASKIN: With the highest --\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: -- minimum sentence for that most serious crime.",
  "The panel stated that this was just one of 15 criminal and regulatory referrals made to various state and federal agencies for it, which were referred to the Justice Department.",
  "And he has experience, as we heard in those clips, and as we've heard all morning, in more than one testimony before the Senate of saying things that turned out to not be true.",
  "Much has been said in recent months about the aggressive agendas of hostile foreign actors to undermine our nation's democratic process, as we've talked a lot about it today.",
  "But there's been no substantive action by any congress over all that time and there's been a sharp decline of corresponding decline in compliance over the last two decades.",
  "Papadopoulos, that's the former Trump campaign adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government.",
  "I mean the president has said publicly that he does not believe that the Justice Department is doing its job because they are not adequately investigating Hillary Clinton.",
  "[14:09:35] REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA: You're aware of the July 27th letter that the Judiciary chairman and 20 members of the committee sent demanding a special counsel?",
  "He's top of the DOJ as the A.G. We remember what President Trump was saying about the DOJ and, you know, looking into these things, as he was headed off to this Asia trip.",

  "But we'll look at it and I believe the Congress, Mr. Chairman and members here are entitled to a prompt response from the attorney general and the Department of Justice.",
  "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: My reaction is -- and I hate to make everything about Russia -- but this is a really good day for Vladimir Putin.",
  "But she was probably --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGAETZ: Let's go back to the --\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: But she probably had been following the advice of the Department of Justice.",
  "And so that is why \"I don't recall\" was the refrain that we heard from him over and over again in an attempt to not get tripped up in a way that he did before.",
  "During that particular meeting in question here, Papadopoulos offered to set up this meeting between then candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "President Trump has called the press \"the enemy of the people\", although I think the founders probably thought that a free press was the people's best friend.",
  "M. JOHNSON: Specifically we requested that your office look into the congressional findings of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives from last year.",
  "My contacts would be in the normal course of --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEU: Let me ask you, when have you --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: -- senatorial business.",
  "Did you discuss campaign --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nLIEU: Did you discuss campaign-related items, such as Ukraine with the ambassador?",
  "You don't know how big this is going to turn out to be and it took a number of years, but it certainly proved to be, his prediction proved to be correct.",
  "The problem that Jeff Sessions has, Brooke, is that the president's own public statements fly in the face of the defense that Jeff Sessions made today.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. AL FRANKEN (D), MINNESOTA: You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communication with the Russians.",
  "He's defending the people who work for him in the Justice Department, defending any suggestion that they are being lured into the political arena.",
  "As attorney general, will you commit not to prosecute investigative journalists for maintaining the confidentiality of their professional sources?",
  "Now, again, yes or no, did anyone else at that meeting, including then candidate Trump, react in any way to what Mr. Papadopoulos had presented?",
  "And it's been almost 70 years since Congress first enacted the Foreign Agents Registration Act, to limit and keep track of outside influences.",
  "LIEU: Nothing in that question says you get to answer any differently because you are a U.S. senator rather than say, a young police officer.",
  "The American people are rightfully concerned about these subversive efforts, because it seems to taint our public policy and our elections.",
  "So for hours today you have the members of the House Judiciary Committee demanding that the attorney general explain that discrepancy.",
  "People have blasted (ph) -\n\n\n\n[14:29:37] RASKIN: Well, you've taken the position that we don't have any standing to raise it in court.",
  "Because I was in your shoes and I had, as Chairman Grassley reminded me, letters that I had had pending for a long time not answered.",
  "So what's clear to me is that Donald Trump Junior was an intelligence target of the Russian intelligence services and he fell for it.",
  "SESSIONS: Ah -- well, some of the matters could implicate matters that Mr. Mueller has, for example, that I have recused myself from.",
  "GAETZ: Do you have the authority today, subject to your recusal, to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Uranium One matter?",
  "GAETZ: And you're aware of the November 13th response that we received late last evening provided by the assistant attorney general?",
  "REP. JERROLD NADLER (D), NEW YORK: Yes or no, did you chair the March 31, 2016 meeting of the National Security Advisory Committee?",
  "So I guess what -- in taking that position that we don't' have standing to raise it, what is the appropriate constitutional remedy?",
  "M. JOHNSON: We found some letters --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: (INAUDIBLE) Chairman, good last proposals -- or fix some of that.",
  "But also it -- at the end of the day, what the story says about Sessions is that he made the right decision, saying, don't do it.",
  "But I just will not answer it in a way that suggests that I am anyway intentionally mislead anyone when I answered the question.",
  "That was his --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEU: Let me ask you two simple questions, because in a sense you've already answered it.",
  "LIEU: Let me ask you about one of your international --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: I thought that was a reasonable answer.",
  "And, you know, I think what's interesting is, first of all, that it sort of -- he claims that that just jogged his memory.",
  "NADLER: So you were obviously concerned by Mr. Papadopoulos' connections and his possibly arranging a meeting with Putin.",
  "Senator (INAUDIBLE) --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: They have taken some action on, I think it's only seven cases in what?",
  "In all of my testimony I can only do my best to answer your questions as I understand them and to the best of my memory.",
  "He says he was in the dinner and as he walked out, he told me I'm going to Russia and I made no response, what so ever.",
  "SESSIONS: Well, you're --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEU: Nothing in that question authorizes you to answer any differently.",
  "LIEU: Russian Government Official Ambassador Sergey Kislyak last year, how many interactions did you have with him?",
  "LIEU: And to get that security clearance you submitted a security clearance application, also known as SF86 Form.",
  "Well, I don't know what he did, and have no knowledge of him (ph) giving a report to me, and did act for (ph) me.",
  "I was confused about one thing that came up in the various questioning about the meetings with Mr. Papadopoulos.",
  "Senator Grassley and I have filed companion bills to clear up the ambiguities in existing law and allow the O.J.",
  "I met with over, approximately 25 ambassadors last year and I had that same day as, well, excuse me, go ahead.",
  "Did Mr. -- yes or no, did Mr. Papadopoulos mention his outreach to the Russian government during that meeting?",
  "And I remember an experienced senator, I'll say, Senator John Kyl of Arizona -- he said, this is a huge thing.",
  "So are you saying that it is the attorney general, it is your decision that is dispositive on those matters?",
  "SESSIONS: I would say that nobody at the FBI or any other place, to my knowledge, said you left that blank.",
  "And -- and conducting my office in a way that respects that and the rules within the Department of Justice.",
  "As it relates to Loretta Lynch using the pseudonym 'Elizabeth Carlisle' -- are you recused on that matter?",
  "M. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Attorney General, thank you for your service to this country.",
  "I'm going to ask you two simple questions --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSESSIONS: Yes, we did talk about Ukraine.",
  "Would you agree that without the special investigation, these cases would likely not have become public?",
  "LIEU: If Donald Trump were to ask you to pledge loyalty to him or to take such an oath, would you do so?",
  "But he did not -- he did not give an inch on that, at least today when he was -- when he was testifying.",
  "That organization, the intelligence community agrees, received information from the Russian government.",
  "NADLER: There are reports that you shut George down, unquote, when he proposed that meeting with Putin.",
  "Ah, several, a couple months later, I believe in September, he asked for a meeting and I provided that.",
  "So clearly, everybody can agree, much has changed in the world since the FAIR law was enacted in 1938.",
  "And that was clearly the frustration and some of the partisanship that we saw from the Democrat side.",
  "GAETZ: Do you have the authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Fusion GPS Dossier?",
  "And I would ask Mr. Chairman for a unanimous consent to enter a copy of that letter into the record.",
  "And all I did was meet in my office with the ambassador, which we didn't discuss anything like that.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: All right, so that's just a piece of some of what we've watched today.",
  "You have the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, just getting grilled under oath on everything Russia.",
  "We have about 90 percent of the people who make those claims are referred for some sort of hearing.",
  "At another point I thought I heard you say, don't represent yourself as speaking for the campaign.",
  "SESSIONS: He made some comment to that effect as I remember after having read it in the newspaper.",
  "SESSIONS: And -- so we've brought one enforcement action against R.T.; Russian TV, I guess it is.",
  "So last year, how many interactions did you have with Russian government official Sergey Kislyak?",
  "GAETZ: I'm not asking you to evaluate a case --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK) SESSIONS: Well, you basically are.",
  "But I would say, in defense of Attorney General Lynch, I used the same, I have a pseudonym also.",
  "LIEU: You said under oath today that you had a meeting with Ambassador Kislyak of under an hour.",
  "We heard the vociferous, you know, defense of himself as an honorable person, an honorable man.",
  "He was very clear that he was going to follow the guidelines of the Justice Department on that.",
  "So again, either you're lying to U.S. Senate or you're lying to U.S. House of Representatives.",
  "Were you telling him not to go, or just not to go and officially speak for the Trump campaign?",
  "The answer that you gave was \"No,\" what you just told us under oath was exactly the opposite.",
  "I came off the platform and the people were there and we chatted a moment, had an encounter.",
  "GOODLATTE: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Johnson for five minutes.",
  "We're going to take you back to the hearing as soon as it starts up again on Capitol Hill.",

  "I understand all cabinet officials do, and maybe some sub-cabinet officials do.",
  "I don't even want to know if the investigations are happening or not happening.",
  "GAETZ: I'm asking you to evaluate your authority to appoint a special counsel.",

  "The chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin for five minutes.",
  "We did not need to do that then and we ought to go -- we need to curtail it.",

  "That contradicts what Jeff Sessions said in earlier congressional testimony.",
  "And now he's saying, OK, since the media reports, yes, I do remember that.",
  "I'll just say it that way, because it was --\n\n\n\nNADLER: Well, you -- yes.",

  "SWALWELL: Well, we -- we're on the third edition, Mr. Attorney General.",
  "Yes, there's no question that he was -- look, he's defending his honor.",
  "Today you mentioned again about the Credible Fear process being abused.",
  "Surely you've met with some foreign officials in the last seven years.",
  "That's exactly the opposite answer you gave under oath to U.S. Senate.",
  "I would say it's not, it does not call for the most maximum sentence.",
  "SESSIONS: I am once and for all answering the question, congressman.",
  "But I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied.",
  "Not that -- I don't want to know anything about the investigations.",
  "Did Donald Trump ever ask you to pledge an oath of loyalty to him?",
  "SWALWELL: What's the answer to the question, Mr. Attorney General?",
  "In the meantime, the news continues right now, right here on CNN.",
  "He -- I'm sorry, I thought you were going to a sound bite there.",
  "Let me be clear, I have at all times conducted myself honorably.",
  "SESSIONS: Well, I don't know what a pledge of a loyalty oath is.",
  "So I just -- my response, I'm sorry that -- that's my response.",
  "He said it looked like he -- went in one ear and out the other.",

  "And so -- it's a matter worth serious consideration.",
  "Let's talk about your contacts with a foreign power.",
  "more oversight, so we do appreciate your attention.",
