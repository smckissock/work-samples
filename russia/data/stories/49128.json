  "Cambridge Analytica's file on David Carroll included predictions on how Carroll felt about various issues\n\nAppearing before a British parliamentary committee earlier this month, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was asked if his company would provide American citizens, like David Carroll, all the data it holds on them and tell them where the data came from.",

  "Carroll's lawyer, Ravi Naik, said in a statement Friday, \"Our client has every confidence that the court will order disclosure so that he and the American electorate can begin to understand how their data was used in the 2016 election.",
  "The company added that no data that was obtained through a company called Global Science Research, which mined Facebook data, was used as part of the services Cambridge Analytica provided to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign.",

  "Last year, David Carroll, a professor at the New School's Parsons School of Design, used a British data protection law to ask Cambridge Analytica's branch in the United Kingdom to provide the data it had gathered on him.",

  "The claim against Cambridge Analytica came the same day that Facebook suspended the company from its platform as the social media site investigates the company's use of data on Americans.",
  "However, a week later at the same committee, the United Kingdom's data commissioner said Americans could request information from companies that processed their data in the UK.",

  "Carroll, a registered Democrat, said that the company had accurately predicted his views on some issues and less so on others.",
  "A few weeks later, however, the company responded providing Carroll with a spreadsheet of information it had about him.",
  "Cambridge scored Carroll a nine out of 10 on what it called a \"traditional social and moral values importance rank.\"",
  "\"If you just go by the topics, they are ranked in a way that demographics alone can't explain,\" Carroll told CNN.",
  "However, Carroll alleges that the data firm did not fully disclose how it arrived at their predictions.",
  "Nix said that there was no legislation in the US that provided for individuals to make such a request.",
  "Cambridge's file on Carroll included predictions on the importance of various issues to him.",
  "Data privacy is a fundamental right and one that Cambridge Analytica takes very seriously.\"",
