  "As someone familiar with Indiana Democratic politics put it, “Bayh is running.”\n\nThe move is a major boost for Democrats, whose bid to take back the Senate was shaken last month when Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) reversed course and decided to run for re-election and gave the GOP its strongest chance of holding that seat.",
  "(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nSenate Democrats have lured former senator Evan Bayh out of retirement and expect him to be their nominee in Indiana, scrambling a previously overlooked Senate race and increasing Democratic chances for reclaiming the majority in November.",
  "So Bayh enters the race with very high name recognition and he still has $9.3 million leftover in campaign funds from his previous Senate races, while Young has just $1.2 million in his account after a hard-fought win in a contested Republican primary.",
  "He signed up with McGuire Woods, a global law firm, to advise the firm’s clients on dealings with Congress and the administration, and he also signed on as an adviser to Apollo Global Management, a Manhattan-based private equity firm.",

  "Mark Kirk and Ron Johnson, respectively, and if Bayh can claim Indiana, Democrats would need to win just one or two more of the next handful of Republican seats that are considered very competitive this fall.",
  "A day after Bayh’s wife, Susan, underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last July, Schumer cut off an interview with The Washington Post to take a call from the ex-senator to check on her recovery.",
  "However, Bayh’s post-Senate career, and his words disparaging the institution as he left six years ago, provide some ammunition for the Republican nominee, Rep. Todd Young, against the former senator.",
  "The decision is also a major victory for Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will become Democratic leader next year and desperately wants “majority” as the first word in his official title.",
  "Upon the news of Bayh’s entering the race, independent political handicappers at the Cook Political Report immediately moved the race from safely in GOP hands into its “tossup” category.",
  "Baron and I have spoken and we both believe that we must send leaders to Washington who will put Hoosiers’ interests ahead of any one political party,” Bayh said in a statement.",
  "He served two terms as governor before being elected to the Senate, and his father, Birch Bayh, served three terms in the Senate and ran unsuccessfully for president in 1976.",
  "In the spring of 2015 Bayh purchased his second home in Washington, a $2.9 million Georgetown six-bedroom home that he described as his way of “downsizing”.",
  "Democrats need to gain four seats and have Hillary Clinton win the presidency to claim the majority, or five seats if their party loses the White House.",
