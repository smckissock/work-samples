  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nZUCKERBERG: If you told me in 2004 when I was getting started with Facebook that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, you know, I wouldn't have really believed that was going to be something that I would have to work on 14 years later.",

  "SEGALL: Knowing what you know now, do you believe Facebook impacted the results of the 2016 election?",
  "Actually most of what they did was not directly, as far as we can tell from the data that we've seen.",
  "CORTES: I just want to hear somebody said that Donald Trump --\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: He got business dealings.",
  "KUCINICH: Daily beast did a piece about this right after the election, and asked around to experts.",
  "And a lot of this was done with fake accounts that we can do a better job of tracing and using A.I.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We're going to get Part 2 of Laurie Segall's interview in just a second.",
  "I mean, I think whether it's that person's fault because they're not a good boss or whatever it is.",
  "Don't you think users have the right to know that their data is being used for different purposes?",
  "Joining us is Jackie Kucinich, Michael Caputo, Jennifer Granholm, Steve Cortes, and Paul Begala.",
  "Isn't that selling to a third party, or are they just considered the advertiser their customer?",
  "The last hour, I talked about this with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.",
  "You know, each -- George Bush, for god sakes --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: You think he's still in that period.",
  "You know, they've told me -- Mark told me today they're putting many, many resources into this.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: Isn't the whole point that Mueller's investigation -- listen, listen.",
  "BEGALA: I'm asking that question --\n\n\n\nKUCINICH: What has he gotten from being nice to Putin?",
  "So anyone whose data might have been affected by this, we're going to make sure that we tell.",
  "ALEKSANDR KOGAN, DATA MINING RESEARCHER: Because the reality is that our app wasn't special.",
  "Is the platform being weaponized by foreign actors, and are they taking it seriously enough?",
  "I mean, this is our responsibility to our community is to make sure that we secure the data.",
  "KUCINICH: I'm inclined to agree with you that we need to judge the President on his actions.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Back now with Laurie Segall, Brian Stelter and Matthew Rosenberg.",
  "And full disclosure, I had Russian dressing on a little across the street before I came in.",
  "ROSENBERG: So I think they probably qualify that and saying we're not giving them the data.",
  "There has not really been anything critical that he has said out loud about Vladimir Putin.",
  "I mean, as you say, the good news here is we already changed the platform policies in 2014.",
  "SEGALL: Are you specifically seeing bad actors trying to meddle with the U.S. election now?",
  "I'm sure there's, you know, V. two, version two of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016.",
  "A sixth device found as you may know, did not detonate, that was one at the FedEx facility.",
  "You know, I think that it is -- it's really hard for me to have a full assessment of that.",
  "BEGALA: He doesn't want to have one with Britain, Canada, or Mexico or NATO, or the pope.",
  "This started in the Obama administration --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right, but Trump is President now.",
  "Here's part two of Laurie Segall's exclusive interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "We're going to build a tool where anyone can go and see if their data was a part of this.",
  "So as far as we understood around the time of that episode, there was no data out there.",
  "Facebook says Kogan misled them, that he was supposed to only use the data for research.",
  "Zuckerberg is there talking about moving forward, you know, new chapter, all this stuff.",
  "I mean Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, and therefore our lunch for a long period of time.",
  "Thirdly, slapped sanctions on Russia, and then fourthly --\n\n\n\nKUCINICH: Under pressure.",
  "And if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.",
  "And I think we have some sense of the different things that we need to get in front of.",
  "Matthew, thank you, all of you, I appreciate it, Laurie Segall as well, Brian Stelter.",
  "Federal agents are trying to determine if he acted alone or if any other bombs remain.",
  "Right, so that was a major tactic that we saw Russia try to use in the 2016 election.",
  "He's attacking the criminal infrastructure, our aviation system, our nuclear energy.",
  "GRANHOLM: I think Putin has some compromise on him that he doesn't want to release.",
  "CORTES: You're telling me the pee tape or whatever the heck it is, has credibility?",
  "There are thousands if not tens of thousands of apps of doing the exact same thing.",
  "COOPER: I mean, whether it's good wise or not, it's like a realtime Rorschach test.",
  "GRIFFIN: Now the attorneys general of at least three states are demanding answers.",
  "And if we detect any suspicious activity, we're going to do a full forensic audit.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: So the short answer is, is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do.",
  "If he could say that in 2014 when he's not President, why can't he say it in 2018?",
  "GRANHOLM: So how long does this playing footsie, how long does this have to last?",
  "COOPER: Matthew, do you really believe that Facebook is getting in front of this?",
  "He talked to Lou Wasserman, who had been his agent, a legendary guy in Hollywood.",
  "Why are we arguing about this when Mueller is going to come out with the answer?",
  "MICHAEL CAPUTO, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE: The tone he took doesn't concern me.",
  "And I think the general consensus not just in America but all around the world.",
  "It was not directly about the election but was more about just dividing people.",
  "And that's not a media opportunity, right, or at least it's not supposed to be.",
  "And that's where Kogan came along, Aleksandr Kogan, the professor at Cambridge.",
  "[21:00:03] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight we have an exclusive interview.",
  "I mean, these are not -- according to the reporting, these are not enforceable?",
  "SEGALL: Lawmakers in the United States and the U.K. are asking you to testify.",
  "And people don't feel like they've received that same amount of transparency.",
  "CORTES: Right, if we --\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: I don't want you to help me, believe me.",
  "They testified in front of Congress and said there was no real directive yet.",
  "[21:20:04] SEGALL: Do you what the -- speaking and getting in front of them.",
  "And I said to him, but we're sitting right here and we're talking about it.",
  "And there are a few basic things that I think we need to do to ensure that.",
  "Aired 9-10p ET\n\nAired March 21, 2018 - 21:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.",
  "But in a White House, I don't -- I haven't heard of that being done before.",
  "And I don't to President but I talk to people who just got a call from him.",
  "He's clearly concerned about this enough to suddenly put himself out there.",
  "This is a platform that has two billion users that can influence elections.",
  "It's not whether there should be regulation it's what kind there should be.",
  "I mean, never in history has a President been --\n\n\n\nCAPUTO: So transparent.",
  "COOPER: I mean, he did say repeatedly --\n\n\n\nCORTES: -- around it, tell me.",
  "He wanted to demand that White House staff sign nondisclosure agreements.",
  "So our responsibility now is to make sure that this doesn't happen again.",
  "COOPER: Well, frankly, you can watch his Twitter and see what's going on.",
  "Also, before we go tonight, I want to give you a quick programming note.",
  "SEGALL: I'm going to challenge you --\n\n\n\nZUCKERBERG: But we're here now.",
  "And this is something that I think we now need to go figure out, right?",
  "And it's -- there's no longer a plausible, innocent explanation, right?",
  "If he just stops today and stops talking, then, no, this is not enough.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n[21:35:17] COOPER: A lot to discuss with our panel.",
  "Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHIEF BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN POLICE: At this point.",
  "The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him.",
  "CORTES: -- agency hacking the Senate intelligence for the legislation.",
  "They're careful to do that, because they want to get more phone calls.",
  "BEGALA: What drove me crazy when I was a White House aide, I hated it.",
  "They didn't tell us the truth that we're somehow the victims here too.",
  "So I think the reality here is that this isn't rocket science, right?",
  "We're going to need to see them put their money where their mouth is.",
  "You know, at first he did say, well, it's got to be the right person.",
  "The President hasn't inspired sufficient loyalty in most senior team.",
  "I think some of the sources are people he talks to on the telephone.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[21:58:10] COOPER: More breaking news tonight.",
  "CAPUTO: Because there's been no proof at all that there is anything.",
  "But before that, we know what the apps were that had access to data.",
  "So this is going to be an intensive process, but this is important.",
  "Why does it take a big media report to get that proactive approach?",
  "And now I'm hearing my data might have been exploited by campaigns.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: What we see are a lot of folks trying to sow division.",
  "You know, we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.",
  "COOPER: More now with the panel -- we're going to have more ahead.",
  "And I think that we're going to be disappointed this time as well.",
  "So he's willing to testify although he added a little wiggle room.",
  "But if this is part of an ongoing conversation, that's important.",
  "Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry.",
  "He apparently has gone ahead and done that according to a source.",
  "I think a lot of users wonder, OK, this happened a few years ago.",
  "And if you get fired, you can go and talk smack about your boss.",
  "As he's speaking to Putin, Putin is attacking the United States.",
  "And it should be fairly easy to figure out who those people are.",
  "I'll tell you something, Anderson, he doesn't like to do press.",
  "tools to be able to scan and observe a lot of what is going on.",
  "GRANHOLM: He should be signing his own nondisclosure agreement.",
  "CORTES: Anderson, you had Director Clapper on talking earlier.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, there were so many different forces at play.",
  "Every White House leaks --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: And what does that said?",
  "That is exactly what Mueller is looking at, one of the things.",
  "CAPUTO: But this is an American problem, not a Trump problem.",
  "No, but what I'm saying is his tone, he said it in his tweet.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated.",
  "And he also said he's open to conversation about regulations.",
  "Transparency is the buzzword behind closed doors at Facebook.",
  "I know a couple of senators are working really hard on this.",
  "CAPUTO: He wants to have positive relationships with Russia.",
  "COOPER: But federal employees also have certain protections.",

  "And I'm confident that we're going to do a much better job.",
  "CORTES: Listen, as a loyal catholic --\n\n\n\nBEGALA: I am too.",
  "And so I agree with you, but I think for different reasons.",
  "JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: At the sushi place?",
  "He sure is acting like a guy who Putin's got something on.",
  "If it's not enforceable, I don't think there's much to it.",
  "But I think that this was clearly a mistake in retrospect.",
  "THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.",
  "And that's an issue today and tomorrow and down the line.",
  "I believed that since July when the DNC e-mails came out.",
  "BEGALA: I want to know a plausible innocent explanation.",
  "You should have the same level of transparency required.",
  "And we're committed to getting that right going forward.",
  "This is the taxpayer's -- nondisclosures are a bad idea.",
  "You know, what did you think of Sarah's briefing today.",
  "CORTES: But this might be a very important distinction.",
  "Thanks for watching, time to land it over to Don Lemon.",
  "So we may not have all of the data in our system today.",
  "He even said as we were sitting there, this is serious.",
  "He is now one of the most powerful people in the world.",
  "CORTES: Are you telling me the dossier has credibility?",
  "It's not enough that he sucks up but he won't stand up.",
  "Why not --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCAPUTO: I understand that.",
  "Because we just think that this is an important thing.",
  "It is\n\n\n\na series of statements he has failed to make.",
  "Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the 'smarts.'",
  "KUCINICH: But those people aren't in the inner circle.",
  "270,000 people voluntarily took the personality test.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, it's hard to know what we'll find.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, I think having kids changes a lot.",
  "But Mark Zuckerberg at this point is a world leader.",
  "I don't have no way to say --\n\n\n\nCAPUTO: Deep state.",
  "So it could kill the story to protect the President.",
  "He'd rather be spending the day with his engineers.",
  "I mean we've seen a whole bunch of theories, right?",
  "SEGALL: Was it putting too much trust in developer?",
  "This is all according to the Trump administration.",
  "And I think if you're smart, you don't dish on it.",
  "The longer answer is this is a very positive step.",
  "Obviously the White House is concerned about that.",
  "I think somebody needs to be marched out in cuffs.",
  "We'll going to be right back with more news ahead.",
  "\"The Washington Post\" first reported this Sunday.",
  "SEGALL: I mean I think this is a really big deal.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Um, I'm sure someone's trying, right?",
  "They're wondering what's happening to their data.",
  "But Kogan doesn't believe he did anything wrong.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: That's why I'm doing this interview.",
  "SEGALL: Although, you are the brand of Facebook.",
  "This is a bad idea, this is not his corporation.",
  "CORTES: OK. Let's answer this question, please.",
  "PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right.",
  "But there's a big election in India this year.",
  "CAPUTO: By these calls, he's always done this.",
  "I think why wasn't there more of a follow-up?",
  "But first, CNN's Drew Griffin sets the stage.",
  "But the problem is we're always disappointed.",
  "GRANHOLM: Well, I don't know fairly disagree.",
  "COOPER: You said, you've been so transparent?",
  "And I don't know if a bill is going to pass.",
  "CORTES: Because I'm going to laugh out loud.",
  "We're going to be even conservative on that.",
  "But we're going to review thousands of apps.",
  "SEGALL: Have you done a good enough job yet?",
  "And we were much happier with how that went.",
  "I want to make sure we do a good job at it.",
  "He attacks the pope for god's sakes, Steve.",
  "I don't like him attacking the Holy Father.",
  "The White House called it completely false.",
  "You know, the reality is --\n\n\n\nSEGALL: Why?",
  "Has he done enough to quell the criticism?",
  "And he begins by asking them their advice.",
  "And he doesn't raise any of that with him.",
  "H also didn't reference any terror groups.",
  "Obviously that's a huge concern for them.",
  "It's something the President wants to do.",
  "They wanted to see them show up and talk.",
  "And let me tell you what actions we took.",
  "SEGALL: So why didn't Facebook follow up?",
  "And they all provided that certification.",
  "We just wanted to quietly get rid of it.",
  "COOPER: We want to get a quick break in.",
  "And I'd be happy to do it at that point.",
  "This is part of an ongoing conversation.",
  "I think that was basically his message.",
  "But they also have certain protections.",
  "Vladimir Putin doesn't have a nickname.",
  "CORTES: You're saying he's compromised.",
  "So if that's me, then I am happy to go.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Oh, that's -- that is hard.",
  "Can Facebook be trusted with your data?",
  "They're taking it incredibly seriously.",
  "CORTES: Somehow I knew that was coming.",
  "I would classify this as a confession.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, I think we will see.",
  "He looks utterly subservient to Putin.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCORTES: Let's get here.",
  "Do you think I should fire John Kelly?",
  "So I think that was an important step.",
  "SEGALL: What is the right regulation?",
  "But I believe something must be done.",
  "He doesn't like to even go on camera.",
  "Instead, he collected it and sold it.",
  "COOPER: Right, throughout his career.",
  "COOPER: Is it a smart idea, Michael?",
  "Number one, he's willing to testify.",
  "So his arrogance to me is appalling.",
  "That is raising some more questions.",
  "And so it is absolutely imperative.",
  "He's attacking our electrical grid.",
  "The Russian tale was clear in 2016.",
  "You know, you say you certified it.",

  "He's not naming the enemy, is he?",
  "There's a big election in Brazil.",
  "Will you testify before Congress?",
  "Where's our information weapons?",
  "You've got to say radical Islam.",

  "STELTER: The short answer is no.",
  "COOPER: That's a good question.",
  "Everybody wants you to show up.",
  "Why wasn't there an audit then?",
  "BEGALA: He should tweet it out.",
  "But do most Presidents do that?",
  "\"CNN TONIGHT\" starts right now.",
  "Well, and I'll say deem state.",
  "It was completely commonplace.",
  "And I think we got that wrong.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: And the bad stuff.",
  "This is a good step, Anderson.",
  "But we need more transparency.",
  "You've got to name your enemy.",
  "He's attacking our elections.",
  "I don't even like to do this.",
  "You are the name of Facebook.",
  "People want to hear from you.",
  "How do you actually do that?",
  "Why is he in Putin's pocket?",
  "COOPER: That's a fair point.",
  "That's what I'm saying, yes.",
  "Here's some of what he said.",
  "So they each have different.",
  "That's according a lawsuit.",
