  "As chief product officer of a business that is focused on helping businesses better understand their target audience, I have seen that consumers are beginning to understand that data is the currency that makes free or near-free services possible, and they’re thinking carefully about the tradeoffs of sharing personal information.",
  "On the leading edge, some marketers are combining deep, rich insights about why consumers buy from traditional, survey-based market research along with behavioral data or “big data” to understand what consumers bought, when, where and how.",
  "Businesses should embrace the changes resulting from increased data privacy and get out in front of it by being clear about their privacy policies and incorporating solutions and tools that still allow them to leverage consumer data.",
  "Those companies adjusting their practices based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are already establishing the precedent, and the brands that don’t apply GDPR quickly will risk losing credibility among consumers.",
  "If you don’t have permission, then shift from trying to understand a specific individual and instead find solutions that help you understand and personalize your message and product towards an audience.",
  "They then leverage these insights to build predictive models and create audiences that are of sufficient size and scale in which they can market to with very high levels of consumer engagement.",
  "Case in point, sensitive information related to health conditions, credit scores or data on minors all require different treatment because of varying classes of protections under U.S. law.",
  "In many cases, an audience is constructed based on predictive models, which will score, or group, consumers into different buckets because the model predicts they may respond similarly.",
  "Therefore, this approach should be reserved for cases when you have expressed opt-in consent to talk to the consumer and need to target individuals based on a very specific objective.",
  "As a result, brands may have a more difficult time getting the information they need in a digestible way that allows them to better understand consumers’ needs and preferences.",
  "However, successful companies understand the difference between one-to-one marketing, one-to-many marketing -- otherwise known as “audience” marketing -- and mass marketing.",
  "But as businesses, how are we to respond to this shift in consumer thinking -- and more importantly, how does it affect the way we conduct business and understand consumers?",
  "Mass marketing is probably the easiest to tackle because when engaging in its practices, there is very rarely any personal data being used to generate a message.",
  "They also can protect customer anonymity and deliver the promise of highly relevant and engaging personalized messages using advanced audience-based marketing.",
  "Direct marketers have been doing this for over 50 years with simple tactics like changing the cover on the catalog you used to receive in your mailbox.",
  "On the other end of the spectrum, one-to-one marketing requires an individual level of understanding of the consumer and appropriate privacy consent.",
  "So, if you’re not compliant, act now -- this also applies to businesses that only transact in the U.S. but want to stay ahead of the curve.",
  "Solving Challenges Created By Privacy Regulation\n\nMaking organizational changes to support customer data privacy doesn’t have to be hard.",
  "It’s easier than we think to adopt new processes and methods, and both consumers and brands stand to benefit in the long run.",
  "As I've stated before, international laws such as GDPR, as well as state legislation, further complicates these issues.",
  "This means it’s more important than ever that you are transparent with consumers regarding what you do with their data.",
  "In this way, you can craft a message specific to people who may prefer green and have better relevance and engagement.",
  "Perhaps just as important is the discernment regarding when to use each approach and the necessary data permissions.",
  "Lastly, the current trend suggests consumer data protection will become more complicated before it becomes simpler.",
  "In many cases, the court of public opinion can be far more damaging to your brand than the actual law of the land.",
  "If someone with an eighth-grade education can’t grasp what your privacy policy says, then it’s time for a change.",
  "And today, the specificity of the audiences you create and the engagement it can drive is quite profound.",
  "First, privacy will become an expectation or norm among consumers -- unless explicitly stated otherwise.",
  "The bottom line is that brands can still achieve the necessary understanding of consumers.",
  "Consumers are more aware than ever of the impact of data privacy on their personal lives.",
  "The world in which we function as organizations will change in several distinct ways.",
  "Think about people who may prefer green as opposed to people who may prefer pink.",
  "An audience is simply a cohort of thousands or millions of like-minded consumers.",
  "It’s also becoming an increasingly smaller portion of the overall marketing mix.",
  "At best, it’s limited to evaluating metrics like gross rating points (GRPs).",
  "This is how network TV advertisements have been bought and sold for decades.",
  "Second, transparency in privacy policies is no longer going to be optional.",
  "The good news is that audience-based marketing is an advanced practice.",
  "Short, clear, concise privacy policies enable consumer understanding.",
  "Just look at RapLeaf, Cambridge Analytica or Navistone for examples."
