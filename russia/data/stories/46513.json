  "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has ordered Cambridge Analytica to release all the personal information and data it has on an American voter, opening the way for as many as 240 million U.S. voters to request their data back from the political consulting firm that had ties to the Trump campaign, The Guardian reports.",
  "Recently, Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of a data scandal that rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data.",
