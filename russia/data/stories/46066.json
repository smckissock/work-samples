  "\"We'll determine after we do that whether or not there are steps that need to be taken in the form of regulation or legislation going forward, but right now we want to get the answers and we think Facebook needs to be accountable, transparent and I'm glad Mr. Zuckerberg is appearing today,\" Thune told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday.",
  "He added, \"We're going to try to get to the bottom of this and I think it's entirely likely sometime in the future that Cambridge Analytica and perhaps other firms may be called in to talk about how they got access to this data, how they used it and whether not when they were told to, shut it down.\"",

  "\"Facebook has to step up, take responsibility for what happened and tell us what they're going to do in the future to protect users data and what they're going to do proactively to stop the harmful conduct that now they've had to go back and apologize for,\" said Thune.",
  "\"The whole issue of social media and its influence in our lives and the data they have access to is going to be an ongoing issue now,\" said Thune.",
  "The Republican said that Zuckerberg's testimony matters because more Americans are growing concerned about their privacy.",
