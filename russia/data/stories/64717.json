  "He also detailed China's use of \"debt diplomacy\" to expand its influence, noting the large loans Beijing makes to countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to help finance infrastructure projects.",
  "The Trump administration's push to highlight these Chinese actions comes amid an ongoing debate over what role another global power, Russia, played in influencing the 2016 presidential election.",
  "He noted that tariffs Beijing has imposed in response to Trump's initial tariffs on China \"specifically targeted industries and states that would play an important role in the 2018 election.\"",
