  "When I look back, I would have tried to do what (current Bellator President) Scott Coker did, which is to fly under the radar, and not, like I said, poke the bear.”\n\nEven the sponsorship business that brought Affliction MMA industry was built on shaky ground, Atencio said.",
  "“Our contracts weren’t completely dialed in, and it was one of those things where I was able to get guys like Georges (St-Pierre) in the beginning, and our contracts weren’t ironclad, and it was a thing where we were learning,” he said.",
  "It’s really that simple.”\n\nIn 2009, Affliction Entertainment quickly imploded after the cancellation of its third event, “Trilogy,” and the company returned to its previous role as a UFC-approved clothing sponsor.",
  "As far as my own life, I’ve always tried to move forward.”\n\nAtencio’s life bears little resemblance to the days when he was a figurehead of a wildly successful apparel company that decided to compete with the UFC.",
  "After a stint running his own T-shirt printing company and another “sitting at home doing nothing for a while,” he volunteered his services to Jeff Clark, a former MMA manager and owner of Arena MMA in San Diego.",
  "Ten years ago, Tom Atencio was there when Affliction Entertainment jumped headlong into the MMA major leagues with “Banned,” a show as glitzy and gaudy as the T-shirts that funded its existence.",
  "The biggest, Atencio said, is “not to poke a bear.”\n\n“When I say ‘a bear,’ (I mean) the Fertittas,” Atencio said of former UFC co-owners Lorenzo and Frank.",
  "The company burned through millions of dollars on a pair of pay-per-view events and failed to break the industry-leader’s grip on the MMA marketplace.",
  "But in spite of the way things ended, Atencio looks back with pride when he thinks about many of his accomplishments as the company’s vice president.",
  "“I couldn’t care less about what happened in the past, because to me, the future is more important.”\n\nAtencio’s break from Affliction wasn’t clean.",
  "But at the end of the day, at least I did something.”\n\nFor more on the upcoming MMA schedule, check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.",
  "It was something I never in a million years would have imagined I would have been, and not only where I was, but doing what I was doing.",
  "Huge money.”\n\nEventually, Affliction pivoted from MMA into other markets as its once-ubiquitous MMA shirts faded in popularity.",
  "He wanted the UnderArmour and the Nike, and he wanted the bigger money, although we were paying him, at the time, huge money.",
  "It’s not a day that holds any special significance for the former clothing executive, who now works as a graphic designer.",
  "He doesn’t blame anyone for the way things turned out, because it taught him a lot of lessons about business and life.",
  "“I hope my son can one day back and go, ‘Yeah, that was my dad.’ To me, it’s better to be a has-been than a never-was.",
  "“I’ve never claimed to be the smartest guy in the world, but I’ve worked hard and I’ve done things,” Atencio said.",
  "He was a matchmaker for a major MMA event, doing business with legends like Fedor Emelianenko and Vitor Belfort.",
  "He even managed to find time to get in the cage himself, something his well capitalized competitors never did.",
  "When you’re dealing with somebody at that level, especially in business, it’s a whole different animal.",
  "“Not true.”\n\nToday, Atencio works three days a week for a group of Crunch gyms in Southern California.",
  "It’s going from a $1 million business to a $150 million business, and it’s a whole different caliber.",
  "“I had no idea,” Atencio told MMAjunkie when informed of the show’s 10-year anniversary Thursday.",
  "“Honestly, I’ve never been a person to look back unless it’s about history I can learn about.",
  "Not that I’m saying I’m a has-been, but I did what I did, and I’m not in the market any more.",
  "It’s not as glamorous as his previous job, but it doesn’t carry the same notes of heartache.",
  "“Not to speak ill of Georges, but he was one of the guys that really didn’t like Affliction.",
  "Just like anything else in life, there’s a lot of stuff you would have done different.",
  "“The perception of it is that I’m completely independent and stupidly rich,” he said.",
  "They would get what they could, and they would wear other companies at the same time.",
  "He caught a piece of the wave that turned MMA from fringe sport into hot commodity.",
  "The circumstances of how he left the company isn’t something he wants to dwell on.",
  "I guess I didn’t just realize the caliber of people that we were going up against.",
  "The attention Affliction garnered as a new market player came at a steep price.",
  "It’s a steady job that gives Atencio the flexibility to raise his young son.",
  "“I tried to be good at what I did, but it’s just a whole different animal.",
  "“I don’t think somebody could have been more grossly underestimated.",
  "He left Affliction in 2011 and no longer works in the MMA industry.",
  "“Honestly, it was one of best parts of my life,” Atencio said.",
  "“I couldn’t care less about the brand,” Atencio said.",
  "“Quite frankly, there were a lot of whores out there.",
  "It’s like going from pony league to professionals.",
  "I love the fight industry, but I’m not.",
  "“I don’t think I was in over my head.",
  "“It was a complete dream come true.",
  "So you can look at it either way.",
  "He had higher aspirations.",
  "He really didn’t.",
  "I wish I were."
