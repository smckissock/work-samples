  "Ryan Collins of Pennslyvania pled guilty on Wednesday to orchestrating the celebrity iCloud hack known in the seedier parts of the internet as \"the Fappening\" or \"Celebgate.\"",
  "Then, armed with their passwords, he would use them to download full iPhone backups from iCloud â€” which came with contacts, text messages, calendars, and photos.",
  "Here's how the chef did it: he would phish celebrities with emails that looked like official password reset notifications from companies like Apple or Google.",
  "He'll probably serve 18 months for what he did, although he faces 5 years, which included leaking nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton online.",
  "Some suspect that he had assistance from others, including two Chicago men who had their homes searched as part of the investigation.",
  "He might not even be the mastermind of the hack, though."
