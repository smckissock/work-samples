  "This recent article substantiates the widespread AI pilots that are more common today:\n\nVendors of AI technology are often incentivized to make their technology sound more capable than it is – but hint at more real-world traction than they actually have… Most AI applications in the enterprise are little more than ‘pilots.’ Primarily, vendor companies that sell marketing solutions, healthcare solutions and finance solutions in artificial intelligence are simply test-driving the technology.",
