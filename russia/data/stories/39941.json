  "But, the judge said, “The overall wild thing that went on here just cannot be condoned by the court.”\n\n\n\nAttorneys for the convicted men said they will appeal.",
  "“But I cannot say in all honesty to the court that I believe I did anything wrong.”\n\n“The verdict is wrong,” Mr. Slatten told the judge.",
