  "In preparation for season 7 premiering July 16 (so close, but feels as far as Daenerys has been from Westeros this whole time), we ranked the 15 best episodes just in case you're one of those people who doesn't have enough time to re-watch the entire series in less than two weeks.",
  "Now that there's more battles, twists, deaths, wildfire explosions, Frey pies, and alliances, the episodes have gotten more intense — with more action than exposition — but there are still some stand-out episodes from the earlier seasons.",
  "HBO As \"Game of Thrones\" gets frighteningly close to its endgame and the characters get closer to each other geographically, the episodes get more thrilling.",
  "Here are the best episodes of \"Game of Thrones,\" ranked."
