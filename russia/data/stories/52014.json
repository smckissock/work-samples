  "In an interview with Slate in July, Glenn Greenwald took issue with journalists speculating on ties between Trump and Putin:\n\nThe history of linking your political opponents to Russia is a really dangerous and ugly one in the U.S. That’s basically how, for a decade, the right demonized the left, but also liberals.",
  "That’s a somewhat incomplete gloss on the situation: The change in the Republican platform to which Greenwald alludes was hardly the only incident, and Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. might recognize the Crimean takeover is hardly a “standard liberal view” except perhaps in the pages of The Nation.",
  "The platform change that he wanted said that he didn’t think the U.S. should be funding factions in the Ukraine in order to defend themselves against Russia because he didn’t think we had a vital interest in Russia’s neighborhood.",
  "Nonetheless, evidence of hacking on both parties might give the press pause, and grant some credence to Greenwald’s suggestion that the press was too quick to validate the idea of a Russian hit on the Democratic Party.",
  "All that said, bipartisan hacking doesn’t preclude Kremlin sympathy for the Republican Party; after all, the U.S. government spies even on its allies, as Angela Merkel can attest.",
  "On the one hand, Russian hacking targeted at the RNC and Trump team would reinforce the worrying idea that a foreign government is trying to meddle in the American election.",
  "This is the rhetoric that has been resurrected in order to demonize Trump, and I do find it disturbing because, what has he said about Russia?",
  "Trump’s perplexingly positive view of Putin is no less strange if Russian agents aren’t out to help him; in fact, it’s stranger.",
  "So far, Reuters is the only outlet with the story, but if it’s right, it would put the entire existing narrative in question.",
  "As for the hacks, the full story may also be richer, stranger, and more worrisome than it initially appeared.",
  "It’s not altogether surprising that someone would want to snoop on both parties.",
  "You can argue with that and say it’s an irresponsible thing to do.",
  "But that’s been a standard liberal view for decades.",
  "But it would make the motives a little more obscure.",
  "Let’s leave that to them."
