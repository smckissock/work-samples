  "Facebook owns Instagram, so saying Facebook is losing because users are going from Facebook to Instagram is like saying Walmart (NYSE:WMT) loses when shoppers go to Sam’s Club instead of Walmart.",
  "At the end of July, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recorded the biggest single-day drop in stock market history when the company reported soft Q2 numbers alongside an even softer guide.",
  "Does FB stock really deserve to trade at multi-month lows, with a far below-average valuation, and be in the midst of its biggest sell-off in five years?",
  "Specifically, Facebook gets essentially all of its revenue from digital advertising, so the company is entirely reliant on this tailwind continuing.",
  "Thus, unless we all stop using our phones and go back to watching cable, the digital-ad industry will continue to see a massive influx of dollars.",
  "With respect to regulation stunting Facebook’s ability to use data to optimize ad solutions, this is happening across all of digital advertising.",
  "Thus, so long as ad dollars flow into the digital channel (which is an inevitable consequence of engagement going digital), Facebook will win.",
  "This should be successful because Instagram has growing engagement and a visual-first format which lends itself well to digital commerce.",
  "New Growth Areas Are Promising for Facebook Stock\n\nAnother big problem with Facebook stock is that the company lacks revenue diversity.",
  "At $160, Facebook stock is also trading at just 21x forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 33x .",
  "Therefore, so long as ad dollars continue to flow into the digital space (which will inevitably happen), Facebook stock will win.",
  "Things at Facebook aren’t that bad, and I fully expect the company to blow estimates out of the water next time they report.",
  "In the big picture, then, Facebook still dominates the digital-advertising industry due to its four billion-plus-user apps.",
  "If one gets regulated, they all get regulated, so the playing field within the digital advertising field will remain level.",
  "Most importantly, the company is leveraging its social media dominance to get a foot in the door in the e-commerce space.",
  "While Facebook Marketplace wasn’t a big success, Facebook is trying again with an Instagram standalone shopping app.",
  "Facebook Still Dominates Digital Advertising\n\nEveryone is concerned about two things when it comes to Facebook.",
  "Facebook isn’t being disadvantaged relative to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), or Snap (NYSE:SNAP).",
  "And, the stock is 25% off its recent high, which marks the biggest correction FB stock has seen in five years.",
  "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, are things really that bad at Facebook?",
  "That is why Facebook stock trades at just 21x forward earnings next to 40%-plus revenue growth last quarter.",
  "The risk here is that such regulation will stunt growth across the entire digital-advertising industry.",
  "With respect to core Facebook engagement falling, this is true, and it has been true for a while.",
  "After the big post-earnings drop dragged shares to $170, FB stock rebounded quickly to $185.",
  "At that point in time, sentiment should normalize, and Facebook stock should move higher.",
  "Second, regulation could stunt Facebook’s ability to use data to optimize ad solutions.",
  "Ad dollars follow engagement, and engagement is only becoming increasingly digital.",
  "But, core Facebook engagement is falling because Instagram engagement is rising.",
  "Messenger and WhatsApp are the largest mobile communication apps in the world.",
  "As long as users remain in the Facebook ecosystem, that is all that matters.",
  "There are six social media apps with 1 billion or more users in the world.",
  "Facebook owns four of them (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram).",
  "While that tailwind should continue, investors don’t like that reliance.",
  "This is the stock’s lowest level since the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",
  "And, WhatsApp and Instagram are the largest Stories apps in the world.",
  "First, there is falling engagement on the core Facebook platform.",
  "Instagram is the largest photo-sharing app in the world.",
  "Inevitably, users will remain in the Facebook ecosystem.",
  "But, neither of those concerns seem all that bad to me.",
  "Ever since then, Facebook stock has struggled.",
  "Now, Facebook stock is closing in on $160.",
  "Facebook is the largest app in the world.",
  "But, Facebook is diversifying.",
  "But, that rally didn’t last.",
  "That won’t happen.",
  "I don’t think so."
