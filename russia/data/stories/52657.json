  "James Mulvenon, an expert on Chinese military and influence operations and general manager of the special programmes division at SOS International, a security contractor, said: “There is some discussion … about Chinese campaign finance issues at the local and state and senate level, and I think we’re going to need to dig deeper on that, because I personally have not seen any concrete evidence of the same level of meddling, particularly directed towards the midterms.”\n\nCybersecurity experts said China was more engaged in industrial espionage and intellectual property (IP) theft than in attacks on the electoral system.",
  "“We urge the US to correct its wrongdoing, stop groundlessly accusing and slandering China and harming China’s interests and China-US ties, and take concrete actions to maintain the sound and steady development of China-US relations.”\n\nIn a thinly veiled critique of US foreign policy, Hua said “the international community has already known fully well who wantonly infringes upon others’ sovereignty, interferes in others’ internal affairs and undermines others’ interests”.",
  "Trump and 'collusion': what we know so far about Mueller's Russia investigation Read more\n\nPence’s remarks – and Trump’s original claim at the UN security council that the Chinese “don’t want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade” – come at a time when the Trump campaign is under investigation for possible collusion with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favour.",
  "On the same day Pence made his speech, the Dutch authorities revealed evidence that Russian military intelligence had tried to hack into the computer systems of the Organisation for Prevention of Chemical Warfare and the US justice department indicted seven Russian intelligence officers for a “lengthy and wide-ranging conspiracy” to hack into private computers and networks around the world.",
  "Trump accuses China of meddling in midterms, citing Iowa newspaper ad Read more\n\nThe vice-president’s allegation echoes a similar claim made by the president at the UN last week, but it has been contradicted by cybersecurity experts and the administration has yet to provide any supporting evidence, other than to point to instances of overt lobbying.",
  "“As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.”\n\nChina described Pence’s speech as “unwarranted accusations” and said it “slandered China by claiming that China meddles in US internal affairs and elections”.",
  "Following Pence’s remarks, a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security said there was no contradiction with Nielsen’s earlier statement, adding that she had been speaking exclusively about threats to election infrastructure such as voting machines and voter registration databases.",
  "Russia accused of cyber-attack on chemical weapons watchdog Read more\n\n“We are seeing a massive amount of intrusions by China into organisations all around the US, but mainly aimed at economic targets,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder of CrowdStrike Inc, a leading US cybersecurity firm.",

  "The vice-president made an additional allegation, saying that “China is targeting US state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy”, but did not give details on how local government was being targeted.",
  "“China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential election,” Pence said at the Hudson Institute, a Washington thinktank.",
  "But what we see with China right now are the influence campaigns, the more traditional, longstanding, holistic influence campaigns,” Nielsen said on Tuesday at a Washington Post cybersecurity conference.",
  "Paul Pillar, a retired senior CIA analyst, said he would be “surprised” if there was a US intelligence assessment that the Russian threat to elections “pales in comparison” with the Russian threat.",
  "In July, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said that China, from a counterintelligence perspective, “represents the broadest, most challenging, most significant threat we face as a country”.",
  "The administration’s own secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, said: “We currently have no indication that a foreign adversary intends to disrupt our election infrastructure.",
  "We have not seen a lot of going after political causes.”\n\nJohn McLaughlin, the former acting director of the CIA, said that Pence appeared to be echoing what Wray said in July.",
  "The official said the homeland security secretary had not addressed “malign foreign influence that seeks to sow discord, undermine or advance targeted politicians”.",
  "Like Trump, he pointed to an openly Chinese-sponsored newspaper supplement in Iowa, that argued against the administration’s policy on trade tariffs.",
  "However, Wray added that China represented “a different kind of threat” from Russia and was focused primarily on economic espionage.",

  "In his remarks on Thursday, Pence alleged a far more focused Chinese assault on US democracy.",
  "We personally have not seen hacking of political campaigns and the release of documents.",
  "In his speech, Pence did not offer any new evidence for his allegations against Russia.",
  "“We know they [the Chinese] have the capability and we know they have the will.",
  "“That is not from inside knowledge, but we know so much about Russian efforts.",
  "Nothing anywhere like that has come out about the Chinese,” Pillar said.",
  "Any efforts to rhetorically attack China would be “futile”.",
  "“My guess is this is speechwriter’s hyperbole.”",
  "China is meddling in America’s democracy.",
