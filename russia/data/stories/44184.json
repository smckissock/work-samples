  "This is something of a surprise to observers since - although it has been widely reported that Hillary Clinton and, before her, Barack Obama had recruited hordes of bright young computer scientists to drive their campaigns - it had been assumed that Trump relied on more traditional means of connecting with voters.",
  "Although organizations like Cambridge Analytica and the Cambridge Group are at the forefront of this discipline, Yoon suggests that companies can become increasingly adept at identifying and engaging superconsumers through building up their own analytic capabilities.",
  "In its discussion of Cambridge Analytica's supposed role in the Trump success, the FT points out that the Clinton team probably thought that it had enough data to win but that - with technology developing as fast as it does - that is a dangerous position to take.",
  "What this translates into is using extensive detailed information - the company says it collects up to 5,000 \"data points\" on 220 million Americans - alongside psychological insights to model target audiences and predict the behavior of like-minded individuals.",
  "Superconsumers account for about 10% of consumers for a particular product or category, but they can account for between 30% and 70% of sales, an even greater share of category profit and almost all of the insights useful for innovation that a company gains.",
  "Just how far and fast this field is advancing is likely to be demonstrated this week at an event in London promoting the newly-published book Superconsumers: A Simple, Speedy and Sustainable Path to Superior Growth (Harvard Business Review Press).",
  "David Gosen, general manager, platform solutions, and senior vice president international at Rocket Fuel, a business that uses big data and artificial intelligence to make marketing more effective, will also be speaking at the HBR event next week.",
  "This enables those using its services - whether a corporation or a politician - to abandon the traditional one-size-fits-all promotion and opt for a much more narrowly focused message based on what is known about the person concerned.",
  "Rocket Fuel now describes itself as \"a full programmatic marketing platform designed to go beyond 1:1 marketing by learning to predict what marketing actions to take with a particular person in a particular moment of time.\"",
  "The fragmentation of the media landscape, with many more channels and formats, and the associated fragmentation of the consumer have meant that brands have lost control and are no longer able to send out a single message.",
  "At the heart of the matter is the role of Cambridge Analytica, a company that claims to use expertise in behavioral change and data science to \"offer unparalleled audience insight and engagement services and products.\"",
  "Gosen says that his own experience at Nielsen introduced him to the term \"consumer scientist,\" and he is convinced that successful business leaders will need to have the sort of expertise that this suggests.",
  "Through analysis of purchase behavior and interviews with selected individuals, Cambridge has come to the conclusion that there are certain consumers who can genuinely be rated \"super.\"",
  "By using AI, businesses like Rocket Fuel - and, by extension, their clients - are able to learn as they go and so build a greater understanding of their marketing and how it works.",
  "Whether or not Cambridge Analytica really played as large a part in the Trump victory as has been claimed - and there are some who dispute that - is really beside the point.",
  "The author is Eddie Yoon, a principal with The Cambridge Group (no apparent relation), a growth strategy consultancy that is part of the consumer research company Nielsen.",
  "As Gosen explains, this takes marketing beyond the segmentation and demographic approaches that were seen as so revolutionary when first introduced only a few decades ago.",
  "In particular, the firm has mined a database of about one hundred thousand U.S. households that have agreed to have all their purchases measured across all channels.",
  "As Yoon explains at the start of his book, the Nielsen connection gives the Cambridge Group access to \"an enormous amount of data about what people watch and buy.\"",
  "In recent days there has been extensive discussion of claims that Donald Trump owes his victory in the recent presidential election at least in part to big data.",
  "Yoon claims that, because of the in-depth knowledge about these people he and his colleagues have built up, they are \"superconsumer whisperers in a sense.\"",
  "With this information, the Cambridge team has created a data set of more than 125 consumer-goods categories representing more than $400 billion in sales.",
  "However, achieving this will require companies to develop different sorts of skills and hire different sorts of capabilities than is currently the case.",
  "These are not bulk buyers - they can always be lured away by better offers - but individuals who have a special attachment to the brand.",
  "Another advantage for companies is the predictability of super consumers - because of that deep emotional connection.",
  "Instead, power has shifted to the consumer and so those seeking to reach them have to behave in different ways.",
  "Indeed, the man himself has insisted he used his \"gut\" in campaigning and regarded big data as over-rated.",
  "As Gosen said in a recent interview, \" the volume and velocity of data are beyond human capability.\"",
  "Unlike the bulk buyers, who tend to look for deals, they are also not particularly price-sensitive.",
  "More important is that this sort of marketing is possible - and being increasingly widely used.",
  "This is because they have \"emotional and aspirational connections\" to the products they love.",
  "They say they know what makes them tick and what makes them so beneficial to businesses.",
  "Things like rallies, slogans and appeals to the fears and beliefs of \"ordinary people.\"",
  "The biggest benefit, acknowledges Yoon, is the amount of business they provide.",
  "\"With every dollar they spend, they get smarter,\" adds Gosen.",
  "No wonder Trump's people were interested."
