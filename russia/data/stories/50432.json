  "These are official events that are – the purpose of which is to represent the United States to the host nation and to the host government.”\n\nThat explanation did not set well with Jim Hanson, the executive director for the Center for Security Policy on June 10.",
  "Ambassador Blake told the Fourth of June gathering that their event was all the more meaningful because the “rights we celebrate are not America’s alone.”\n\nYou know what else is all the more meaningful?",
  "Instead of celebrating freedom, they celebrated green energy – complete with biodegradable balloons and something called “low-carbon sustainable food.” I think that’s government code for inedible food.",
  "The State Department downplayed the change during a June 9 press briefing by pointing out that official Fourth of June celebrations are not meant for the average American living in Jakarta.",
  "“The last time I checked July Fourth wasn't about green energy, it was about self-evident truths, that all men are created equal,” Hanson told Fox & Friends.",
  "It seems the Fourth of July is right smack in the middle of Ramadan this year so the embassy decided to move America’s birthday to the Fourth of June.",
  "The United States Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia celebrated Independence Day a month early -- to accommodate the country's Muslim population.",
  "“We are celebrating a month early to respect the holy month of Ramadan,” Ambassador Robert Blake told a gathering at the embassy.",
  "“These are not events for the American citizen population that’s resident there,” spokesman Jeff Rathke told a reporter.",
  "It’s really hard to mess up an Independence Day celebration – but the embassy staff even managed to get the theme wrong.",
  "Because as we all know – our forefathers fought the British so that we might be able to compost and drive a Chevy Volt.",
  "I suppose that Muslims would be too busy with their fasting and prayers to enjoy an all-beef frank and fireworks.",
  "Celebrating America’s birthday on the right day – instead of getting into a dither over offending Muslims.",
  "“I think the problem is we have become overly sensitive to Islamic sensibilities,” he told Fox & Friends.",
  "And as the Obama administration constantly reminds us -- we simply cannot offend Islamic sensibilities.",
  "“It’s not like a picnic you have with your family and friends when you’re back here in the U.S.",
  "Well, if we wanted to be courteous, we could've just held the celebration at night.",
  "You know what else is great after sunset, fireworks?”\n\nMr. Hanson has a point.",
  "It sounds like every day is April Fool's Day at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta.",
  "Nothing says freedom quite like promoting green energy development.",
  "I wouldn’t be surprised if they observe Good Friday on a Tuesday.",
  "“Ramadan is a time when most Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.",
  "Sparklers aren’t nearly as fun during daylight hours.",
  "The Jakarta Post reported on the holiday swap.",
  "There you have it, America."
