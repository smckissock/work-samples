  "HANNITY: The new Comey standard, if we're going to use the Comey standard, number one, I guess everybody is part of a crime family, if you disagree with James Comey which is outrageous in and of itself, but the standard is, it might be unless presented to a judge, so the judge won't know who paid for it, the judge won't know it's unverified, and the judge will then issue a warrant to spy on an American citizen because it may be possible.",
  "I mean, I think the whole depth, the idea that the top two people and what is our preeminent law enforcement agency in the entire country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, literally now you've had an internal report by the inspector general saying McCabe clearly lied, you had this analysis by Rod Rosenstein, which if you have never read all of it, is really staggering in the degree to which it repudiates Comey.",
  "Despite the immense buildup surrounding the interview and all of the alleged explosive new developments, this book was supposed to reveal, the mainstream media's reaction was mixed, because without a doubt, over the next few weeks, many in the media, they're going to treat Comey as the honorable public servant who stood up to the left's most hated figure -- that being President Donald Trump.",
  "At that time, as you may recall, there was a little bit of distrust amongst some of the political appointees, Director Clapper and Director Brennan so we ran by the statement that we are going to issue to make sure that was in accord with the classified nature of the briefing, and that they wouldn't going to differ in terms of their account of the meeting that we just had.",
  "I agree with David once in a while, I agree that when James Comey held a press conference, and characterized evidence in a criminal investigation which he was conducting as 'extremely careless conduct,' he violates every role of due process and that is what he did with Hillary Clinton and what Justice Department will say to me is, you don't publicly shame and not charge.",
  "But he presents himself as a moored paragon and someone who is discreet and wants to uphold the integrity of the FBI and the DOJ when in fact, he is like a gossipy little girl, he's someone who is not discrete, he has written an inside baseball book discussing things about which there is an active investigation when he was the lead investigator.",
  "But if you're going to go to a FISA court to spy on an opposition party campaign in an election year, and you are going to use unverified, uncorroborated documents that were bought and paid for by one campaign against the other, and a foreign national using Russian sources of all things to get at, is that a crime in Alan Dershowitz's book?",
  "George, why didn't you ask Comey to respond to his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, who told the House Intel Committee, no surveillance warrant would have been sought were it not for the information in that dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and the dossier information was essentially in acquiring warrants.",
  "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: This tortured and troubled man, who you saw last night on television, America's dirty cop, has destroyed the integrity, the reputation, and the legitimacy of the federal bureau of investigation single-handedly by his outrageous performance last night on ABC.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOMEY: I felt this effort to make us all -- maybe this wasn't their intention, but it's the way it felt to me -- to make us all amica nostra, all part of the messaging, all part of the effort, the bosses at the head of the table, and we're going to figure out together how to do this.",
  "Mr. Comey has lied repeatedly last night and regrettably, he lied to the FISA court, he encouraged others to lie to the FISA court, and regrettably, I think Mr. Comey has to be charged with crimes for falsely presenting information to a FISA court and for apparently lying regularly to Congress.",
  "After months of buildup, fired FBI Director James Comey has finally kicked off his quest to become rich and famous and just as we predicted, Comey is now trashing all things Trump, engaging in wild speculation, throwing everybody under the bus, and is the most pitied human being on earth.",
  "And you are also not likely be see questions about his rampant misconduct or how at least a dozen high-ranking FBI Justice Department officials have been demoted, forced to resign in disgrace, and someone fired in the case of Andrew McCabe during the last year of his reign as director.",
  "You can't do -- you can't lie to a judge, Lanny--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDAVIS: And the FISA warrant was constructed by several layers of people at the Justice Department and approved five-time spy agent so I--\n\nHANNITY: Is it wrong to -- is it wrong use unverified information before a judge?",
  "He is saying to George Stephanopoulos, it's still unverified, and yet, Andrew McCabe is on record saying, oh, without the dossier, no warrant, and he's also -- we also know that the dossier made up the bulk of the application, according to the Grassley-Graham memo.",
  "I trusted many people like Eric Holder and many other people who respected him and who just said he exercise extremely poor judgment, and that's the book that I wrote, that the whole world circulates around Jim Comey and he's evidence of a narcissist.",
  "We know the fact that he tries to get his buddy, Robert Mueller, to become a special prosecutor investigating the president, who he didn't want to win the election, his wife didn't want Trump to win, nor did Comey, these are the facts of the case.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: All right, there's been all kinds of wild speculation from the mainstream media today about me and President Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after my name was mentioned in court proceedings earlier today.",
  "And so, I mean, the level of danger that we had in having an FBI director who had this level of megalomania, and who decided that he would supplant the attorney general, whether you like or dislike Loretta Lynch, she was the attorney general.",
  "GINGRICH: Well, look, clearly, if you were to go through all of the falsehoods, whether you are talking to Congress or other circumstances, all of the things that Comey has done, clearly, they are a substantial number of indictable grounds.",
  "And I got intrigued to this morning, so I went back and re-read Rod Rosenstein's report which he did to President Trump just before the president fired Comey and then I read the recently released inspector general's report on Andrew McCabe.",
  "And what's really sobering in here I think what Alan Dershowitz was saying is so important, you had the number one and number two people in the Federal Bureau of Investigation both engaged in behavior that clearly violated the law.",
  "We have laws that are so broad and they apply -- on a show just before, we were talking about the former governor of Illinois, gets 14 years in prison for what people do every single day in state legislatures all over the country.",
  "And, by the way, how many people do you know that can delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washed, bleached bit the hard drive, beat the crap out of her BlackBerrys with hammers, and not get prosecuted for obstruction of justice.",
  "DAVIS: First of all, I want to address the double standard that I'm hearing because Donald Trump praised James Comey for sending that letter that was against 50 years in Justice Department--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: All right.",
  "On January 11th, before intelligence chief came out to Trump tower they were about to issue in a report on their findings of Russian involvement in the election and wanted us to be aware of what that report was going to be.",
  "Tonight, I got to give a special shout out to all of you liberals in the media and all across America, everyone out there that may not usually watch, tuning in, about some recent news about yours truly that came up today.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOMEY: Honestly, I never thought these words would come out of my mouth but I don't know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013.",

  "We sat down, how does that report given to us, at which time, there was a series of questions that were asked by Reince Priebus, General Flynn, Tom Bossert, the homeland security adviser, and Vice President Mike Pence.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: But, you know, it's a complex situation when you are speaking to millions of people --\n\nHANNITY: Professor, it was such a minor relationship in terms of it had to do with real estate and nothing political.",
  "That's what James Comey did--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Lanny, why he need to do it with 33,000 subpoenaed emails, and I acid wash my hard drive and beat up my devices to get rid of them, is that obstruction of justice?",
  "The fired FBI director was quick to cover his back in response to criticisms of how he handled the Clinton inquiry including one instance where he threw former Attorney General Loretta Lynch absolutely under the bus.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: In a self-serving interview, disgraced former FBI Director James Comey told former Clinton White House adviser George Stephanopoulos about his bizarre reaction to the news of his firing.",
  "Also tonight, disgraced former FBI Director James Comey kicked off his much-anticipated book tour last night was none other than Clinton sycophant, Clinton spokesperson turned ABC journalist George Stephanopoulos.",
  "If you watch this show, you know that Comey may have committed a number of crimes and misdeeds, things that I believe need to be investigated, including leaking classified, privileged information to the press.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: During his interview with ABC, former FBI Director James Comey talked about the meeting where he briefed president-elect Trump about the salacious and unverified to Steele dossier.",
  "Today, for hours and hours, the media has been absolutely apoplectic and hyperventilating over some breaking news that I was listed in court today as a client for a long time Trump attorney Michael Cohen.",
  "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR: Well, first of all, Sean, I do want to say that I really think that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohen when you talked about him on this show.",
  "COMEY: Anybody who's actually done investigating knows that if you been investigating something for almost a year and you don't have a general sense of where it's likely to end up, you should be fired.",
  "And James Comey knew before the election Hillary paid a foreign national, Christopher's Steele, through Perkins Coie, for Fusion GPS, and they paid for Russian lies to manipulate the American people.",
  "But you can't go around and talk about the loyalty that you have to the institutions to this country and openly speculate about things of that nature and not wonder, and not have the opposite effect.",
  "And that that was and he knew she paid for it, and that was the basis, the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk of the application that they used to get the warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate.",
  "When we come back, Sean Spicer, he was in the meeting when Comey briefed President Trump when he was president-elect about the dossier, and he is saying Comey's account is completely misleading.",
  "For a former FBI director, one of the highest-ranking law enforcement officials in the country to compare a sitting president to a member of the mafia is disgusting and it's also irresponsible.",
  "It's possible that there's problems with the golden shower thing, it's possible that some of these other things--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: What about lying to a FISA judge to get a FISA warrant?",
  "You know, the rumors, Trump, hookers, Ritz Carlton, Moscow, urinating on a bed -- without a shred of evidence, nothing, James Comey tells Stephanopoulos, well, this could possibly be true.",
  "Remember, when Comey helped draft the letter exonerating Hillary Clinton from crimes that was in May, before she was even interviewed in July and 17 other key witnesses were interviewed.",
  "Joining us now with reaction, the author of \"The Unmaking of the President 2016, how FBI Director James Comey lost Hillary Clinton the Presidency,\" Lanny Davis and author David Limbaugh.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: So, did Jim Comey want to be the person who locked up Hillary Clinton while his daughters and wife are actively rooting for her to become the next president?",
  "That was used by him and others to get a FISA warrant to spy on an American and of course he exonerated Hillary before he ever interviewed her or 17 other key witnesses months before.",
  "GINGRICH: Well, look, the number one thing to recognize out of everything we've learned from James Comey is that this is the world according to Comey, and which Comey is always right.",
  "HANNITY: You better damned well know whether or not that information is accurate and disclosed to the judge that it is a political document and tell exactly who you know paid for it.",
  "The case made today by a very senior attorney in Washington writing in a legal journal, that if you read the inspector general on McCabe, McCabe did exactly what General Flynn did.",
  "So, there you have it, sanctimonious Jim Comey casting judgment from his moral high ground and yet, he doesn't even know if the dossier is true but it was used to obtain a warrant.",
  "And then the cherry on the cake of Comey's irresponsible, unhinged, personal tirade against Donald Trump was a new parroted the liberal talking point that Trump is unfit to serve.",
  "Why didn't you ask Comey to confirm if that dossier was used as the primary piece of information to obtain a FISA warrants on a Trump campaign associate weeks before the election?",
  "So, clearly, if you were to apply the law, and not just apply the social norms among good friends, both McCabe and Comey I think would be in very serious legal risk at this stage.",
  "How many people can store top-secret classified special access programming information on and on unauthorized server and not be charged with a crime and destroy such information?",
  "No FBI director has the authority to decide that he will now replace her and yet, that's what he did, and in explaining why he had to announce what he did about Hillary Clinton.",
  "Given all that had gone on, the attorney general of the United States could not credibly announce this result and if she did, it would do corrosive damage to the institutions.",
  "Remember, the Grassley-Graham memo which found out that the bulk of the FISA application consisted of this unverified, uncorroborated Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Comey is obsessed, let's see, with the size of the president's hands, his tie length, the color of his skin, the color of his eyes, how tall he is.",
  "Meanwhile, on a clip from last night's interview that was on air, Comey also took a shot at President Obama for publicly dismissing claims in Clinton's ongoing investigation.",
  "And it is quite obvious that the dossier was a fake document, that it was absolutely purposefully used illegally by senior officials of the FBI and the Department of Justice.",
  "Joe, I want to start with you tonight, not the least of which I think we got to go to the dossier issue, in large part, because when you look at the dossier, what do we see?",
  "HANNITY: Joe, if I deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, and I acid washed my hard drive, and I beat up devices, again, for subpoenaed material, am I going to get a misdemeanor?",
  "You just want to go off on your own tangents and I won't go there with you except to say once stated Limbaugh and I agree that--\n\nHANNITY: No, except that you can't do that.",
  "HANNITY: You know, David, I brought up the other issues earlier, which is this dossier that he doesn't know to this day is true, and a lot of which has been proven false.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: What did it feel like to be James Comey in the last 10 days of that campaign after you send the letter?",
  "And if you look at the fact that in his interview yesterday, he is propagating the narrative of the president potentially being a pawn of the Russians, what is he doing?",
  "Well, you know, but the idea that he would say it's possible that Trump obstructed justice, that is clearly inflammatory and he knows better and he ought to be ashamed.",
  "Once again, without any evidence to back up his claims, Comey also entertained the idea that Donald Trump, the sitting U.S. president, had been compromised by Russia.",
  "It always struck me, it still strikes me as unlikely, and I would have been able to say with high confidence about any other president I dealt with, but I can't.",
  "(BEGI8N VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: January 21st, 2017, one day after President Trump was sworn in, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets.",
  "After the discussion ended, and again, a key point and that is that there was a lot of questions back and forth, which Director Comey suggest did not occur.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now, FOX News contributor, former speaker of the House, and the creator of Defending America course, on his Website.",
  "You would think as a former FBI director, you know, how can Comey make such a serious claim about a sitting U.S. president without anything to back it up?",
  "Predictably, instead of taking the high road, discussing important topics - - well, Comey liked getting a little personal, and extremely -- well, a penny.",
  "But instead, what I'm talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration.",
  "These two taken together, it is very sobering --\n\nHANNITY: Let me --\n\nGINGRICH: -- to think you had that depth of corruption on the very top of the FBI.",
  "It is inconceivable to me that anyone can now think that he performed a legitimate law enforcement function during the investigation of Hillary Clinton.",
  "And to be absolutely clear, they never involved any matter, any -- sorry to disappoint so many -- matter between me or third party, third group at all.",
  "Why not ask Comey to explain how private communications between a sitting president and an FBI director are not confidential, privileged, classified?",
  "And Comey told Stephanopoulos, quote: 'he's a very smart man and a lawyer and so, it surprised me, he shouldn't have done it, it was inappropriate.'",
  "James Comey drove the criminal process against some people like General Flynn and Manafort and took it away from other people, like Hillary Clinton.",
  "And the author of the bestseller \"Trumped Up: How the Criminalization of Political Differences Engenders Democracy,\" there's some important things.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: This exclusive interview with George Stephanopoulos, there was one man who loomed large, and that James Comey himself.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Loretta Lynch, she released a statement claiming that her actions were pursuant to long time Justice Department policy.",
  "SEAN SPICER, FORMER UNITED STATES WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: No, I think the account that director Comey has in his book is at best misleading.",
  "You can make crimes out of almost anything if you take any complicated issue --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Professor, I don't want to interrupt you.",
  "COMEY: I decided I have to step -- as much as I like her -- I have to step away from her and show the American people the FBI's work separately.",
  "Plus, we'll show you the questions that Clinton sycophant George Stephanopoulos should have asked last night in his softball sit-down interview.",
  "How could you possibly know the likely outcome of a criminal investigation without even interviewing the main suspect or the 17 key witnesses?",
  "HANNITY: My favorite was, I think he is 6'8\", the former FBI director, hiding -- trying to hide with the blue curtains to avoid the president.",
  "HANNITY: You know, Lanny, I got to believe on your side of the aisle, you have a civil libertarian streak in you and I think you feel as I do.",
  "HANNITY: Then, look at all the people who have either been demoted or McCabe fired or people that will be fired I'm sure as a result of this.",
  "The media, while they continue to play up his multiple appearances, this nationwide tour for fame and fortune, it is much ado about nothing.",
  "LANNY DAVIS, AUTHOR, THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016: I've never been your attorney because you don't trust me enough to give you advice.",
  "Further, as Comey himself says in his reporting here, he verbally briefed the president on some of the salacious and unproven allegations.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He made a controversial decision to leak his memos to a friend, who read them to 'The New York Times.'",
  "To go out there and profess loyalty and concern for these institutions and then openly speculate with no evidence is highly irresponsible.",
  "The moment you've been waiting for, when we come back my reaction to all the Michael Cohen hysteria in court today as it relates to me.",
  "And yet, to seek a warrant based on something that even after years, months, you don't have confidence, and raises a serious questions.",
  "Let us remember that James Comey's job was to charge people with crimes after he investigated them and recommended they be prosecuted.",
  "I can't imagine James Comey saying, well, it could be true at this late date, meaning the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier.",
  "This is a desperate attempt to just sell books and suck up to all his liberal friends in the media and trash someone he clearly hates.",
  "Now, was it -- did you ever mention it, that Trump's political opponent in an election year paid for this thing, full of Russian lies?",
  "Comey also speculated about the untrue, unverified, uncorroborated claims that were made in the Clinton bought and paid for a dossier.",
  "By the way, if you don't know if it's true, how does it get presented in a FISA court to get a warrant to spy to an American citizen?",
  "I cannot believe that this guy -- and I think it's an overused the term, 'narcissist,' So let's just call this guy a publicity hound.",
  "But with this strike, the president is sending a clear message to the Assad regime -- you don't use these evil, insidious weapons.",
  "All right, you dislike Lanny -- you dislike Comey for a bunch of other reasons and it's funny because every liberal hated Comey.",
  "And I have to say, I don't think when this book came out and the book tour began, I didn't really expect the level of shrinkage.",
  "COMEY: I drink red wine from a paper coffee cup and just looked out at the lights of the country I love so much as we flew home.",
  "I mean, liberals are attacking him, the members of the Obama administration are attacking him, conservatives are attacking him.",
  "But as an experienced criminal lawyer, I think Joe would back me up on this, applications for warrants are often pretty sloppy.",
  "I actually thought, as bad as this will be for me personally, this is my obligation to protect the FBI and Justice Department.",
  "We should leave it to the public to decide whether to read his book, whether to be critical of him, and the public can judge.",
  "It gave me an uncomfortable feeling because the Clinton campaign had been trying to come up with other words to describe it.",
  "And I'm not trying to by that, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and shaking down shopkeepers.",
  "And that's because I think he has -- it's become brought him, his image, and his attempts to sell books and not the truth.",
  "Watch this, Comey also answered this question about who paid for that salacious dossier with Russian lies and propaganda.",
  "HANNITY: -- and you never verify that information as being true, and it's to get a warrant to spy on an American citizen?",
  "What he did in this particular case was knowingly and willfully abused the criminal process against an American citizen.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell him that the Steele dossier had been financed by his little opponents?",
  "MSNBC today, but on Friday, the U.S. and our allies launched a large- scale aerial attack on multiple targets in Syria.",
  "My discussions with Michael Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions.",
  "He looked slightly orange up close with small white half-moons under his eyes which I assume are from tanning goggles.",
  "Finally, could Comey's special treatment of Hillary Clinton, well, could that be tied to pressure from his own family?",
  "We'll check in with him and Dr. Gorka and my response about being named in court today as it relates to Michael Cohen.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell him the Steele dossier had been financed by his political opponents?",
  "And then they exonerated Hillary after Peter Strzok interviewed her and they brought the exoneration months earlier.",
  "Lanny, I think I might be wrong, I think I once gave you in a restaurant $5, and we have attorney-client privilege.",
  "HANNITY: -- if you went into court and you brought information and you presented it to a judge --\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Yes.",
  "GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: How strange is it to you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss?",
  "We got up, the rest of us exited the room, the secure room where we'd receive the briefing and then went outside.",

  "LIMBAUGH: You know, he started off, I gave him the benefit of that outcome I think he might be an honorable guy.",
  "They can't tell, they can't omit that one candidate paid for the Russian lies that came from a foreign national.",
  "So, he is saying they never corroborated it and they brought that before a FISA court judge and an application?",
  "He lied when he said he had to sent his letter to Congress because he was obligated, because he promised them.",
  "It's an act of stunning arrogance to believe that he was the only perfect person in an otherwise flawed world.",
  "James Comey deserves credit--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: She didn't delete -- she didn't 33,000 emails or she did?",
  "Then at that point, Director Comey said to the president-elect, may I see privately in the back of the room?",
  "But in a few minutes, we'll address all the rampant speculation that couldn't be more wrong in so many ways.",
  "In a few minutes, we will address all of the rumors and speculation and you don't want to miss that at all.",
  "And former deputy assistant to President Trump, Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.",
  "We're not done exposing James Comey and his self-righteousness and frankly, outright lies and misbehavior.",
  "A, you had to talk about Cohen and, B, you didn't want the fact that you had spoken to him to be revealed.",
  "We know that his entire family apparently attended the Women's March on Washington after his inauguration.",
  "These are more words I never thought I'd utter about a president of the United States, but it's possible.",
  "But, first, we have a lot more important news to cover, including the ongoing situation in Syria tonight.",
  "I do agree, too, that he said on television yesterday, that even today, he doesn't have confidence in it.",
  "So, you know, the big issue for the media, for over a year, has been, Russian influence in the election.",
  "I confess I stared at it pretty closely, and my reaction was, it must take a lot of time in the morning.",
  "There is a reason I think that the director's book, and his account, and appearance are getting panned.",
  "STEPHANOPOULOS: And the final straw, Lynch's meeting on an airport tarmac with President Bill Clinton.",
  "All right, Sean you were in the room, you don't see it the same way, you don't recall it the same way?",
  "Full disclosure, David has been my career attorney and has negotiated every contract in radio and TV.",
  "And then I look at James Comey and the pettiness and the bitterness that he had towards Donald Trump.",
  "DAVIS: Look, until yesterday, I've never used the L word about James Comey, which is the 'lie' word.",
  "HANNITY: Alan Dershowitz, professor, I know you don't like criminalization of political differences.",
  "Now predictably, without knowing all or frankly, any of the facts, the media went absolutely insane.",
  "He's managed to have a range of people described him as dishonest that is really pretty remarkable.",
  "So both Director Comey's account of it is misleading and CNN's reporting of that meeting are false.",
  "Of course, this was not the first extremely shaky excuse that he had to go completely unchallenged.",
  "Tonight, we're going to break down some of the most egregious moments from last night's interview.",
  "President Trump says you were writing the conclusion even before you interviewed Hillary Clinton.",
  "Did he withhold the sensitive nature that this document was in fact unverified, not corroborated?",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Here with reaction is former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer.",
  "You don't lie before a judge, nor do you write exonerations before you even interview the person.",
  "He was actually in a meeting when Comey did brief then President- elect Trump about the dossier.",
  "DAVIS: -- the way everybody else did, and you just changed the topic so I return to James Comey.",
  "LIMBAUGH: If he in fact did that, I can't imagine that not incriminating or putting him in jail.",

  "You may not alter or remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from copies of the content.",
  "You can say for certain that the president of United States is not compromised by the Russians?",
  "DAVIS: You praise what Comey did with the letter and so did Donald Trump and that is hypocrisy.",
  "Wasn't this the same march where Madonna talked about dreaming to blowing up the White House?",
  "GORKA: I will just tell you what I received recently, a text from an FBI agent, a senior one.",
  "And we'll have that and so much more in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue.",
  "It's certainly possible that he was involve--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Everything is possible.",

  "DERSHOWITZ: Look, every single libertarian should be concerned about --\n\nHANNITY: I agree.",
  "I would never have charged Hillary Clinton with anything beyond a misdemeanor in her case.",
  "And you're not likely to see any pressing questions about how we let Clinton off the hook.",
