  "These types of rulings are not uncommon – Caesars Entertainment has managed to protect its non-bankrupt parent and private equity sponsor Apollo Global Management from billions of dollars in bondholder litigation using this method – but they can only provide refuge for so long.",
  "By Maria Chutchian\n\nGawker Media’s last-ditch effort to protect itself from a debilitating $140 million judgment using Chapter 11 may be a novel strategy to the media world but pharmaceutical and casino companies alike have recently used it with varying degrees of success.",
  "But this tactic likely won’t be enough to force a settlement in the Gawker case, which at its core is about a personal vendetta, as opposed to complicated business dealings that are typically at the center of corporate bankruptcy disputes.",
  "That case wrapped up in April with the company agreeing to either settle with PharmAthene, find an investor that would cover the damages, or hand over SIGA’s equity to PharmAthene if neither of those options pan out.",
  "The divisive New York media giant announced Friday that it had lined up a $90 million offer from Ziff Davis – which itself went through bankruptcy in 2008 – that will serve as the baseline bid for an auction.",
  "Like many bankruptcy judges, Bernstein often urges creditors and debtors to work toward a negotiated solution, rather than handing down orders that unilaterally force one side or another to concede.",
  "Hogan, whose given name is Terry Bollea, is barred from executing the award against Gawker for now thanks to the “automatic stay” that protects Chapter 11 debtors from creditors demanding payment.",
  "Cerberus Business Finance has offered a $22 million loan that will keep the company afloat – meaning the lights will stay on and employees who remain will be paid – for the next few months.",
  "What that means is once Gawker reaches the stage in which it presents a bankruptcy exit plan to the court, it will have to seek the release of legal claims against Denton to keep him safe.",
  "SIGA Technologies, the pharmaceutical company behind the smallpox drug Tecovirimat, recently used this strategy to fend off a $195 million judgment in favor of competitor PharmAthene.",
  "But Gawker founder Nick Denton, who is jointly liable for $115 million of that judgment plus another $10 million in punitive damages, doesn’t have the same protection.",
  "A Florida jury recently awarded pro wrestler Hulk Hogan the damages in a privacy lawsuit stemming from Gawker’s publication of a Hogan sex tape in 2012.",
  "On top of Ziff’s offer, Gawker has found a lender to fund operations and pay off some of its senior debt while it’s in bankruptcy.",
  "Neither does billionaire Peter Thiel, who bankrolled Hogan’s suit due to his own personal beef with the publication.",
  "It is not out of the ordinary for companies facing insurmountable monetary judgments to use bankruptcy as a shield.",
  "Gawker does have one advantage over SIGA in this situation – it has at least one interested outside buyer already.",
  "The Ziff deal is intended to help fund an appeal of the judgment, which Gawker “feels strongly” that it will win.",
  "SIGA, like Gawker, appealed the judgment during its bankruptcy, but a Delaware appeals court upheld the ruling.",
  "Bernstein will rule Wednesday on whether the bankruptcy court’s protection of Gawker extends to Denton as well.",
  "These kinds of releases are frequently contested by creditors and the federal government’s bankruptcy overseer.",
  "That judge is Stuart Bernstein of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.",
  "But Gawker has more than enough on its plate right now, and that’s a matter for another day.",
  "Gawker must convince a judge that the stay should be extended to cover Denton himself.",
  "Maria Chutchian is a reporter for Debtwire covering bankruptcy.",
  "Hogan clearly has no interest in taking over Gawker.",
  "She can be reached at maria.chutchian@debtwire.com",
  "In fact, Caesars may lose that shield this week."
