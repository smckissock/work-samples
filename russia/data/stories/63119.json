  "BOLTING FROM AN UBER RIDE\n\nThen, after leaving his committee colleagues and the press head-scratching, we got some insight into what inspired Mr. Nunes flight to the Oval Office when Tim Mak filed a piece for The Daily Beast Friday night under the cloak and dagger headline, “Devin Nunes Vanished the Night Before He Made Trump Surveillance Claims.”\n\nCiting “three committee officials and a former national security official with ties to the committee,” Mak reported that Mr. Nunes “was traveling with a senior committee staffer in an Uber on Tuesday evening when he received a communication on his phone,” then, after reading the message, left “the car abruptly, leaving his own staffer in the dark.”\n\nThe next morning he convened the first press conference in a stairwell of the House and issued a Committee press release declaring that, “…on numerous occasions, the Intelligence Community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition” and that “additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.”\n\nMaybe he was upset because he saw his own name in the files.",
  "Those are the questions reporters should be asking as the Intelligence Committee room goes dark this week following his abrupt cancellation of a hearing that could have shed so much more light on the extraordinary number of links between the president, his surrogates and Vladimir Putin, the man Donald Trump fawns over and John McCain calls “a murderer” and “a thug.”\n\nIn 2013 Nunes wrote a blog on the Benghazi attack, insisting that “the American people deserve to know exactly what happened there and why they were not told the truth.”\n\nThey certainly deserve no less than that now; particularly in the face of mounting evidence that Donald Trump’s victory was a Russian cyber coup d’etat — the installation in the White House of what ex-KGB Lt.",
  "That’s us.’”\n\nThe Post noted that the film ended “with the foreign exchange student passed out drunk on a lawn after crashing his wealthy suburban Chicago host family’s car.”\n\nDevin Nunes might have made it on Madison Avenue writing ad copy or penning movie reviews for Rotten Tomatoes, but again, what qualifies him to get briefed on some of the nation’s most protected secrets as one of “The Gang of Eight?”\n\nMOVING AN INTEL HUB TO THE AZORES\n\nUntil this week’s latest blowback, the congressman’s principal claim to intelligence-related fame was his membership on the House Permanent Select Committee that tortuously explored Hillary Clinton’s role surrounding the Benghazi Attack.",
  "All of us are essentially in the dark.” Worse, said Schiff, “The chairman also shared this information with The White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given that the matter is currently under investigation.”\n\nThen, after throwing out the rulebook for intelligence oversight protocol, Devin Nunes abruptly announced the cancellation of a public hearing that had been scheduled for Tuesday in which the former directors of CIA and National Intelligence were due to testify.",
  "Still, at the very infancy of the House probe, Chairman Nunes had already concluded that, “We don’t have any evidence …Trump administration or White House Officials coordinated with the Russian intelligence services.”\n\nThat was a slightly more circumspect declaration than the one he made a month ago when asked about Russian links to the Trump campaign and he said, “there’s no evidence of anything there.” That was February 27, the same day he announced he wouldn’t subpoena the president’s tax returns.",
  "They were so incensed that he’d disappeared, they took to holding candlelight vigils and papering light poles with Nunes MISSING POSTERS that read “JOIN our SEARCH PARTY to make sure he is making health care and PROTECTING vulnerable communities his top priority.”\n\nHow did a lawmaker, so blind to public accountability and clueless to key figures in an investigation of potential treason become the boss of one of the most important oversight committees on Capitol Hill?",
  "Celebrated in 2014 by right-wing talk show host Hugh Hewitt as “one of our rising young stars,” Rep. Nunes confessed that he’d “been working closely with the speaker for a long time” on the Benghazi investigation “behind the scenes.”\n\nBut after a partisan two-year $6.77 million probe, the committee issued an 800 page report which never directly blamed Mrs. Clinton who was secretary of State at the time of the raid.",
  "“I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,” he told reporters, adding that he felt “somewhat” vindicated, even though at this point none of the committee members seems to have a clue just what “they” found, other than routine incidental intel swept up 24/7 by agencies like NSA that wouldn’t merit a visit to the House Commissary; much less two trips to the microphones on the same day.",
  "Even the conservative National Review, described his pork barrel initiative, which would cost an extra $1.2 billion, as a “One-Man War On The Pentagon.”\n\nSo we have to ask: apart from his talent for cattle raising, incendiary phrase making and ethnic loyalty, how in the world did this man get “the gavel” on one of the most important and sensitive oversight committees in Washington?",
  "Whatever the chairman’s motive, Adam Schiff (D-CA) the ranking member on the committee, later blasted him for what he described as “a dead of night excursion” in which Mr. Nunes apparently obtained or reviewed “some documents.”\n\n“And it’s not just that he hasn’t shared them with Democrats,” said Mr. Schiff, “he hasn’t shared them with Republicans on the committee.",
  "But he got one thing right: he provided a forum for FBI Director James Comey to confirm that there was “no information” to back up President Trump’s allegations he was wiretapped by Barack Obama and that the Bureau was, in fact, investigating possible Kremlin contacts with various Trump associates at the time Putin’s apparatchik’s were busy hacking the election.",
  "In what seemed like a bold-faced move to provide cover for Mr. Trump, on whose transition team, he himself had served, Nunes later apologized to his committee members for blindsiding both the Democrats and his own staff, then backed down from the implication that his revelations somehow gave gravitas to Mr. Trump’s March 4th Saturday morning Twitter storm.",
  "Two days later, breaking with all precedent for an intelligence oversight chairman, he held two press conferences that book-ended his unilateral end-run down Pennsylvania Avenue to brief Mr. Trump on what he called possible “incidental” coverage of the Trump transition team during a legal surveillance operation at Trump Tower.",
  "Since then, Devin Nunes’ principal intelligence obsession has been a pet project aimed at relocating The Africa and European Command centers, currently in Stuttgart, Germany to Lajes Air Base on the island of Terceira in The Azores, a volcanic archipelago in the North Atlantic 1,021 miles West of Lisbon.",
  "In fact, during his second press conference Wednesday – the one outside the WH after his ex-parte meeting with POTUS – Nunes confessed that he’d briefed Ryan before his mad dash to the West Wing and the Wisconsin Republican later professed his “full confidence” in the Intel chair.",
  "In 2013, demonstrating his loyalty, Nunes defended the well-tanned Speaker after he was collaterally attacked by the House Freedom Caucus – the same group of ex-Tea Party Members who scuttled Donald Trump’s “repeal and replace” Obamacare initiative this past week.",

  "How did he come to serve on the Trump transition team and how did he go from milking cows in Tulare to a coveted chairmanship on Capitol Hill?",
  "Or, has he been compromised in some way, such that he’d risk the very credibility of his committee in his off-the-books run to the president?",
  "Because, as he put it, he wanted to avoid “witch hunts” and “McCarthyism” in using the committee to probe possible Moscow-campaign ties.",
  "As chronicled at the time in the Washington Post:\n\n“’You guys ever watch 16 Candles?’ the congressman asked a small group of reporters.",
