  "More from The New York Times:\n\nFacebook's Zuckerberg said to agree to testify before Congress over data privacy\n\nFacebook introduces central page for privacy and security settings\n\nWaymo, a Google spinoff, ramps up its driverless-car effort\n\nCambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm’s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.",
  "The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up — “weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there’s a Ping-Pong table.”\n\nMr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built.",
  "The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named “Big Daddy.”\n\nA former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.",
  "It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.",
  "In an initial statement, Palantir said it had “never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.",
  "As a start-up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014, the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon.",
  "The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.",
  "The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016.",
  "Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump’s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.",
  "“What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?” Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, “could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.”\n\nThose negotiations failed.",
  "A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work.",
  "“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.",
  "Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.",
  "“We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”\n\nThe company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort.",
  "At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year.",
  "In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.",
  "But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook.",
  "“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,” the company said.",
  "In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics.",
  "Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge’s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world’s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times.",
  "In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship.",
  "Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account.",
  "Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.",
  "The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.",
  "One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes.",
  "And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir’s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.",
  "“And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.” He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.",
  "By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app.",
  "The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page.",
  "The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie’s testimony on Tuesday.",
  "Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan’s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.",
  "“There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Mr. Wylie told lawmakers.",
  "Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.",
  "But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge’s psychographic models.",
  "Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir’s London office on Soho Square.",
  "Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.",
  "Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.",
  "Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.",
  "“I had left field idea,” Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014.",
  "Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach.",
  "Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.",
  "“Ever come across Palantir."
