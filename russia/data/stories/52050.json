  "Palo Alto Networks founder and CTO Nir Zuk went so far as to imply NSS charged the vendors who are tested a lot of money and gave them undue influence in how the tests were set up so that their products would shine, while products from their peers (the ones who didn't pay) would not.",
  "Zuk later apologized and formally retracted his accusations and then praised the company, \"My statements are untrue and I feel that the nature of their testing is indeed unbiased and invaluable to both us and our customers.",
  "Crowdstrike founder CEO George Kurtz Crowdstrike For many years a company called NSS Labs has tested a wide range of enterprise software products in order to help IT professionals decide which products perform best.",
  "It gained attention as a buzzy startup when it raised $156 million in venture funding, including a huge $100 million round in 2015 from Capital G, the growth investment fund from Google's parent company Alphabet.",
  "CrowdStrike tried, and failed, to get a temporary restraining order and injunction to stop NSS Labs from publishing results of a test that includes CrowdStrike's software and several competitors.",
  "It says it chooses which vendors to test based on requests from IT professionals wanting to buy its reports, and if a vendor refuses to participate, it will buy the product and test it that way.",
  "Google was not pleased, disputed the methodology, accused the tests of being paid for by Microsoft (which NSS denied) and said that the tests didn't even use the latest version of Chrome.",
  "In addition to the Microsoft/Google browser hullabaloo, NSS was criticized by Palo Alto Networks and FireEye in 2014, when they questioned its testing methodology and its ethics.",
  "The upshot is, if you are an independent software tester and you are doing it right, you are going to anger a lot of vendors who will try to discredit your results.",
  "When NSS wanted to include CrowdStrike in one of the tests it would sell in a public report, and announce the results at a major conference, CrowdStrike said no.",
  "CrowdStrike said in a blog post that it initially hired NSS to test its software and issue a private report to be seen only by the peeps at CrowdStrike.",
  "But since the judge ruled against CrowdStrike, IT buyers will be free to see the latest test results, examine the methodology and judge for themselves.",
  "NSS was not deterred, and according to CrowdStrike's blog post, obtained software provided by one of CrowdStrike's resellers and did the tests anyway.",
  "And if you are an independent software tester who is doing it wrong, you are going to anger a lot of vendors who will try to discredit your results.",

  "The company asked a judge to block the release of the report alleging everything from breach of contract to stolen trade secrets.",
  "NSS came to fame years ago for its tests on browser security which found Internet Explorer to be more secure than Google Chrome.",
  "My company, Palo Alto Networks, is working with NSS Labs and we have found them to be completely transparent and honest.\"",
  "The judge in Delaware district court wasn't buying those allegations, and on Monday issued a ruling siding with NSS.",
  "\"It colluded with a reseller and engaged in a sham transaction to access our software,\" the company accused.",
  "In those years it's developed a reputation as one of the most hated independent testing companies around.",
  "Previous challenges\n\nThis is not the first time NSS has raised the ire of the software vendors it tests.",
  "CrowdStrike makes cloud security software that protects PCs and networks from hackers and malware.",
  "And it just had a pretty ugly public spat with security software vendor CrowdStrike.",
  "That round valued the startup at about $667 million, according to Pitchbook.",
  "It said it disputed NSS's testing methodology (calling it \"deeply flawed\").",
  "Neither CrowdStrike or NSS immediately responded to requests for comment.",
  "So the results will be published.",
  "CrowdStrike was not pleased."
