  "In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported (and Facebook subsequently confessed) that the company had been seriously miscalculating multiple key metrics, including “Average Duration of Video Viewed.” The error: Facebook was only counting views longer than three seconds in its “average,” and thus completely ignoring the vast majority of people who were scrolling right past them.",
  "Internal Facebook documents cited in the suit show Facebook employees discussing a “no-PR” strategy to temporarily hide the mistake, and looked for ways to downplay its scope and “obfuscate the fact that we screwed up the math.” Not a good look!",
  "everyone fired over a pivot-to-video should class action sue facebook into a grave https://t.co/nVA8kgwvKI — Rebecca Fishbein (@bfishbfish) October 17, 2018\n\nFacebook is one of the single worst things to happen in the 21st century.",
  "We told our customers about the error when we discovered it — and updated our help center to explain the issue.” Facebook maintains that the seemingly incriminating quotes by its employees have been taken out of context.",
  "The lie persisted not only in the face of conventional wisdom, but ever-mounting evidence that supported the obvious conclusion: No one wants a video to start playing every time they try to read something online.",
  "Online video represented a new hope—the hope that pre-roll, mid-roll, and maybe even post-roll ads would interrupt editorial content so dramatically and unavoidably that people would have no choice but to watch.",
  "Publications such as Mic, Vice, Mashable, and many others laid off writers and editors and cut back on text stories to focus on producing short, snappy videos for people to watch in their Facebook feeds.",
  "But media companies were never the subject nor the main target of Facebook’s inflated numbers, and there’s no evidence that Facebook misled publishers as to how many people were watching their videos.",
  "To back up its claims, Facebook touted impressive statistics that showed vast numbers of people were not only seeing video in their feeds, but pausing to watch videos for extended periods of time.",
  "So much for Zuckerberg’s “golden age of online video.”\n\nSome media companies pivoted back away from video, laying off a lot of the same folks they’d hired in their previous reorganizations.",
  "(There are exceptions, of course: Videos are ideal for conveying inherently visual content, including breaking news events, and can add an extra dimension to a story when used judiciously.",
  "The metrics Facebook presented to video advertisers, coupled with Zuckerberg and co.’s endorsement of video as the future of online media, probably influenced media companies’ decisions.",
  "If there’s a lesson here beyond “don’t trust Facebook,” it’s that media companies are supposed to try to align their business models with their editorial goals—not the other way around.",
  "That kind of data is catnip to online advertisers, who pursue mostly in vain any morsel of evidence that people are actually paying attention to the ads they spend so much money on.",
  "It also argues the error didn’t really affect advertisers all that much anyway because Facebook wasn’t using the mistaken figures in its calculations of how much to charge them.",
  "— Chris Conroy (@dyfl) October 17, 2018\n\nTo grasp that, you have to recall the way Facebook’s rosy claims about video viewership influenced not only advertisers, but publishers.",
  "There’s a reason the phrase “pivot to video” still causes reporters to shudder: The staffing changes inspired by Facebook’s emphasis on video cost good journalists their jobs.",
  "In 2016, the fact that Facebook had been misrepresenting the viewership of video ads to advertisers didn’t necessarily seem like a huge deal to anyone other than advertisers.",
  "Specifically, they will erode advertisers’ trust in Facebook—which could have a more direct impact on the company’s bottom line than more generalized user or public mistrust.",
  "Once again, the media is righteously furious with Facebook—this time, for allegedly misleading advertisers as to how many people were watching videos on the social network.",
  "It was Facebook’s lie, but it was also the lie of every media company that pivoted to video on the pretense that it was somehow a better way to deliver their content.",
  "But as a few timidly pointed out in the wake of the backlash, it also undersells the complicity of media companies and their backers in the misguided video pivot.",
  "If substantiated, they will further erode trust in Facebook, which already has a reputation for hiding major screw-ups such as the Cambridge Analytica data leak.",
  "Facebook’s autoplay video feature (which Twitter copied) made this explicit: You literally couldn’t avoid watching video in your feed, even if you wanted to.",
  "The notion is so patently disingenuous that it’s the subject of a famous Onion parody—which, by the way, predated Facebook’s measurement error.",
  "But that doesn’t quite explain the level of outrage from members of the media when the Wall Street Journal reported on the lawsuit Wednesday.",
  "And it doesn’t explain why people seem so much angrier about this now than they did in 2016, when the measurement error first came to light.",
  "Since the dawn of the ad-supported internet, advertisers have suspected, known, secretly feared that no one was looking at their banner ads.",
  "As advertising budgets shunted toward video to tap the apparent Facebook viewership goldmine, publishers’ editorial budgets followed.",
  "Because, this week, a group of advertisers filed a lawsuit claiming that the measurement error was much worse than Facebook let on.",
  "The outrage centers on Facebook’s alleged deception of advertisers about a particular statistic having to do with video viewership.",
  "The shift from text to video was never about what normal people wanted, for Facebook or the media companies that followed its lead.",
  "Brands were ruined, livelihoods lost, careers destroyed in pursuit of a geyser of video viewership that turned out to be a mirage.",
  "That’s when Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, were going around the world preaching the gospel of online video.",
  "It turned out most people weren’t much more interested in watching editorial video content than they were in watching video ads.",
  "“This lawsuit is without merit, and we’ve filed a motion to dismiss these claims of fraud,” the company said in a statement.",
  "Add to that the allegation that Facebook knew all along it was a lie, and you’ve got some seriously pissed off journalists.",
  "There was a big lie beneath the whole push to online video, but it wasn’t the one about average duration of videos viewed.",
  "(For perhaps the best overview of the lawsuit and its implications, read Laura Hazard Owen’s story in Nieman Lab.)",
  "Earlier this year, Facebook itself announced that users will be seeing less video in their feeds.",
  "Worse, they allege, Facebook knew of the error way back in 2015—and intentionally covered it up.",
  "(Slate recently stopped producing original videos, though it did not lay off any staffers.)",
  "“Suggestions that we in any way tried to hide this issue from our partners are false.",
  "That ad blockers were rendering their messages invisible on more and more screens.",
  "It was always about what advertisers wanted: the captive attention of consumers.",
  "(Facebook admits it screwed up, but denies that it intentionally misled people.)",
  "But that tiff masks a deeper lie on the part of Facebook and publishers alike.",
  "Fast forward to today and it’s clear the problems with online video ran deep.",
  "That company should be shattered and the Earth should be salted in its wake.",
  "Within five years, they said, Facebook’s news feed might be mostly video.",
  "It was the one that said the push to video was about what people wanted.",
  "The real lie was one in which both Facebook and the media participated.",
  "Video, they said, was the future of Facebook and the future of media.",
  "To understand why any of this matters, you have to rewind to 2015.",
  "No doubt Zuckerberg’s grand claims forced publishers to take note.",
  "The fury may well be warranted, the righteousness not so much.",
  "One can understand why advertisers feel wronged, regardless.",
  "Facebook denies any such cover-up of the measurement error.",
  "One problem: Facebook’s numbers turned out to be all wrong.",
  "So forget the metrics misguidance for a moment.",
  "People also really like watching food videos.)",
  "So why are people mad about it again in 2018?",
  "That everyone was blocking their pop-ups.",
  "The claims in the lawsuit are explosive.",
  "Photo by John Thys/AFP/Getty Images.",
  "Text and pictures were on the outs.",
  "Photo illustration by Slate.",
  "Some folded altogether.",
  "That’s understandable.",
  "That was 2016."
