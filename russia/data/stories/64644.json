  "You have a whole generation trained in Washington, DC to think of China as at least a friend and partner, if not an ally, and you throw into that what the book is really about is our secret cooperation with China, through CIA and the Pentagon, a lot of things we did together during the Cold War, that in many ways taught our intelligence community and our military not to see China as an enemy, and they've exploited that wishful thinking as well even as they do things that only an enemy would do, they keep denying it, and we keep believing them.",
  "So I think this was behind President Obama's pivot towards Asia, even though it wasn't as much of a pivot as it should have been and as part of the new national security strategy of President Trump to take the military balance of power in Asia seriously, that we are slowly falling behind, and these Chinese production figures, submarines, jet fighters, even tanks, they're still up, so they're continuing to keep their nuclear forces low, nothing like us or the Russians, but now they're even talking about increasing their nuclear forces.",
  "The defectors themselves are worried about this, and as you mentioned I give them pseudonyms but tried to describe what each one had to say; and one of the most dramatic is they have something called the communist party school in Beijing where they teach the marathon strategy, and part of it is to get market share and high tech and they claim this is how the Americans after the Civil War in many decades, this is how the Americans became the number one power in the world, and that we then dominated the United Nations process in 1945.",
  "There's some level of alarm, but the divisiveness still is there, that the Chinese helped us so much in the Cold War, particularly President Reagan, with the Afghanistan program where they sold us $2 billion secretly of weapons, that we then transferred to the Afghan rebels and forced the Soviet Union into a humiliating defeat to withdraw from Afghanistan, whereas the Soviets themselves undercut them in Eastern Europe.",
  "Sometimes, they focus on an individual in the company who has the trade secrets of the company and they will, in some sense recruit him not necessarily as an espionage asset, but as somebody who they simply offer a salary of $2 million, that you leave, in this case, I'm of thinking General Motors, \"You leave your company and come to work to for us and show us how to make cars.\"",
  "But the other goal is what I would call sort of the soft underbelly of our academic establishment, that they need visas to have access to China, so it's been very well understood for at least 20 years, if you say the right things about China, you'll have no problem getting your visa for your research into the Chinese Social Security System or whatever you want to study.",
  "PILLSBURY: I think our presidents, and including myself at the time as an adviser to these presidents, we did not understand the scale of China's ambitions, so any particular example that would be detected, the FBI would just arrest the person committing economic espionage, we put them in jail for six months or a year, and assume this was a one-off thing.",
  "I hate to use the word \"insinuate,\" but they got into our companies in pretty much the same way, that we have a market of 600 million in the world in the bourgeois middle class, you can market your products to that class, but you're going to have to have some sharing attitudes towards your technology ...\n\nLEVIN: In other words hours, we are towards them.",
  "In our own system, we had a lot of detente advocates, Dr. Kissinger and President Nixon were deep believers in detente, somehow working out a balance of power with the Soviet Union, and we discovered that the Chinese were willing to use force and fairly aggressive efforts including sniper rifles being provided and commando raids inside the Soviet Union.",
  "And frankly, one of the first things they did is wake up Jimmy Carter at 3:00 in the morning, his science adviser was in Beijing, and the Chinese made clear, \"We want an agreement, that all of our students who want to go America in science can go, and the National Science Foundation will share all American scientific discoveries quickly with China.\"",
  "And in many ways, they can't believe that America puts up with this and has not discovered it over such a long period of time, and the defectors to some degree have warned me that they believe China is entering a period of maximum danger over the next five to ten years, that this is the period where they will pull ahead in economic strength.",
  "Many departments of government are still following Jimmy Carter's orders from 1979 that every department of the government must have a joint commission or a partnership with China and find some way to help Chinese economic growth, even in nuclear reactor safety, for example, we provide them knowledge of nuclear reactor safety.",
  "Then they found out there were strings attached that if you wanted a particular human rights dissident from China to speak, or if you wanted the Chinese defector who had the high-level knowledge of the Chinese strategy to speak, no, you couldn't do this because you place in jeopardy your contract with the Confucius Institute.",
  "Some were staying in the west, perhaps because they love liberty and feared going home to a nation of tyranny, and this team gave them all the incentives -- very high salaries, special living areas, their own laboratories to work on their new scientific projects and more and more of these people are going home.",
  "They also helped us in Cambodia, as you recall the Vietnamese Army had invaded Cambodia, and the US and several other countries, I tell the story in \"Hundred-Year Marathon,\" got together with the Chinese intelligence service and provided weapons to the Cambodian resistance to kick the Vietnamese Army out.",
  "They don't have any nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at all, but in the war games, I have been involved in against China, when I'd been there, sometimes on the China team, so-called red team, I would always find if I fight with an American style, then the American team would win that particular war game.",
  "The question for me is, given the nature of our government, and particularly given the nature of one political party that has us focused on Russia, Russia, Russia, you look at the media, we're focused on Stormy Daniels and things of that sort, maybe there's a story now and that slips through about China.",
  "This is how they see President Trump, as the first American president who has awakened to this danger, but they're still gambling that there's enough opposition to President Trump in the Congress and in the media, that he will not be able to turn things around in terms of the China challenge.",
  "So I would say the main challenge from China remains economics, trade, technology, politics, influencing the next generation, but the military challenge is there too, and I was very just delighted that Secretary of Defense Mattis recently made his first visit to Beijing in his entire career.",
  "And as I say, we mostly help them, our government did, through the front door, and our companies did as well under the illusion that someday the Chinese market would open up and these companies would enjoy massive profits, only a few companies have succeeded at that, most have not.",
  "And they realized it was not through hostility or demonizing other countries, it was going to be by getting inside the government of these other countries to extract what you might call the way to become the number one power in the world, and they've succeeded in doing that.",
  "That goodwill translates into massive foreign investment, the acceptance of Chinese exports, indulgences when the government or state affiliated organizations are caught stealing technology or violating WTO rules, and looking the other way on human rights abuses.",
  "Even I who have -- and I have great admiration for Chinese strategy, as you can tell, even I didn't think they would be that dramatic to say we are protecting the world against President Trump in terms of free trade, and this has a lot of love people believing.",
  "PILLSBURY: Chinese says no, these are just Chinese that wanted to live in ...\n\nLEVIN: Live in the paradise of Russia ...\n\nPILLSBURY: ... live in Siberia, but there's a number of Chinese efforts to get control of energy resources, minerals by Russian companies.",
  "LEVIN: When we come back, I want to ask but the way the Chinese government has insinuated itself into academia in this country to affect how younger people think about China, the types of scholarship that come out of these colleges and universities.",
  "He has the concept that they are a challenge to our global leadership, and he also has the concept that they're really in some sense businessmen, so that the tariffs present a kind of effect on China all out of proportion to what they actually are.",
  "They've not only got their own space station, because we wouldn't let them mate with ours, but they're talking about men, people on mars and they're still dangling the idea of joint space missions and they've been very pleased with three movies.",

  "LEVIN: Now, back to the United States, you've said that unlike really any enemy, and I do consider them an enemy, that we faced, they have secreted themselves, that is government entities, individuals, in our country, in our government?",
  "During the Reagan administration, you were the Assistant Undersecretary for Defense for policy planning and responsible for implementation the program of covert aid known as the Reagan Doctrine, but you worked for Nixon, George H.W.",

  "Western countries offer such concessions, primarily because their leaders are convinced that overall, China is moving in the right direction toward freer markets, productive international cooperation and political liberalization.\"",
  "If they had not had our market for their exports over the last 40 years, if they had not had our direct investment, and our scientific exchange programs, the help of our companies, they wouldn't be the great power they are today.",
  "There's still the community that says, \"They just want to be our partner in the world,\" but as they ignore United Nations resolutions, as they're caught with more and more technology theft, it becomes harder to explain this away.",

  "The Pentagon began to realize that the Chinese were going upstream ahead of our current technology and trying to purchase -- succeeding in purchasing the technology to produce weapons and win wars 10 or 15 years from now.",
  "PILLSBURY: And over time the Pentagon learned more and more, no matter who -- they can shift to someone else to play the Chinese team, but as long as the Chinese team used Chinese strategy, the American team would lose.",
  "Tariffs themselves are not bringing China to its knees, but the fact that an American president is talking about them as a challenge is something new, and because of his success so far, I have lost some of my pessimism.",

  "That base of hard currency paying students is important to them, that they not be challenged or investigated by the FBI, which the FBI director has already raised in public his concern about these students.",
  "That at that time, the Soviets were their enemy as well as ours, so they would help us take them out, but who would have thought later they would see us as a rival for global leadership and turn on us.",
  "So I think we're in a period now, which I think will go on for many more years of waking up, but being a little uncertain what to do when China and China's friends are already deep inside our system.",
  "To some degree, the Commerce Department and the US Trade representative have gotten more concerned about the ripping off of our trade and our market share of world production in almost everything.",
  "I'd say yes, but actually the defectors are still alive and their view is the cynicism of the Chinese strategy that the things that took me so long to discover, the defectors can confirm all this.",
  "Now you wrote an amazing book, \"The Hundred Year Marathon,\" that grabbed my attention because of its incredible relevance -- China's Secret Strategy To Replace America as the Global Superpower.\"",
