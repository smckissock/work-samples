  "Solving this requires more than just transforming and delivering data but also automated tools that make it easy to discover relevant datasets, track and version machine learning data models, manage data preparation and cleansing, and share analytics queries.",
  "But despite the advances in DevOps and cloud that have accelerated software delivery, time to market and ability to deliver innovation to the business remains hampered by bottlenecks associated with manual, ad hoc mechanisms to secure, copy and move data.",
  "DataOps helps facilitate the automated delivery of realistic data anywhere it’s needed, creating readily accessible catalogs of test and production data to be used wherever it’s needed during development, resulting in greater velocity and higher quality.",
  "Comprehensive DataOps helps identify risk as data flows into, across and out of companies and leverages technology approaches like data masking, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to mitigate risk without losing business value.",
  "Here's how Gartner defines the term:\n\n\"DataOps is a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration, and automation of data flows between data managers and consumers across an organization.",
  "Through organizational and technological change, DataOps promises to accelerate innovation by providing everyone ready access to quality data where they need it while maintaining appropriate security and privacy controls.",
  "Applications are becoming more intelligent and more data-intensive, processing ever-increasing amounts of data, incorporating machine learning and predictive engines and creating highly personalized consumer experiences.",
  "A year ago, I wrote about the different areas of friction that DataOps can address, a sentiment echoed in Gartner’s conclusion that makes no mention of any specific persona, domain or application of DataOps principles.",
  "Over the next year, we’ll likely continue to see the expansion of DataOps principles and approaches that further blur the term, ultimately starting to coalesce as proven practices emerge in the industry.",
