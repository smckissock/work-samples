  "Singer: In a new consumer class action complaint, lawyers for a proposed class of Facebook users claim that “As a result of the aforesaid breaches of Facebook’s agreements with Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class, those Facebook users have been harmed and have suffered damages, both by way of dissemination of their personal information and by losing the sales value of that information, in amounts to be proven at trial.” Rob, as my token economic expert, how would one go about estimating the sales value of an individual Facebook users’ data?",
  "Singer: A recent op-ed in the Washington Post by Staci Kramer explained that her father, who recently joined Facebook, had no clue that they allowed friends to share the following data with third-party apps: “his bio; his birthday; his family and relationships; whether he was online; his timeline; his home town and current city; his education and work histories; his activities, interests and likes; and his activity in apps.” Do you think her father is representative of the typical Facebook user or an anomaly?",
  "On May 25, 2018, the European Union will enact its General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”), in which consumers will “gain the right to access data companies store about them, the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to limit the use of decisions made by algorithms.” In light of the L’Affaire Cambridge, the United States appears poised to replicate a large portion if not all of the European privacy model.",
  "For example, The Economist called for an independent tribunal called the “Data Rights Board” to regulate Facebook and other platforms, tasked with setting and enforcing “the rules by which accredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening users’ privacy.” The Data Rights Board also would serve as a “referee of complaints” from end users, awarding injunctive or monetary relief where justified.",
  "Singer: In the same FTC Watch story, David Vladeck, who was director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection when the decree was struck, noted that one “problem that the agency faces is that part of this depends on the ability of the clients, the willingness of clients to, basically, come clean when there are problems.” By “clients,” I presume he means the target of the investigation, or in this case, Facebook.",
  "Singer: Some like Rajshree Agarwal in Washington Bytes have argued that Facebook users fully understand and internalize the tradeoffs between sharing their private information and enjoying a platform like Facebook’s, and thus we should infer from their acceptance of the terms in Facebook’s user agreement that they value the platform more dearly than whatever they are giving up in terms of privacy.",
  "Larry Downes: Measuring harm has always been a weakness in the FTC’s enforcement of company privacy policies, in part due to the fact that the agency doesn’t have specific authority but uses its general jurisdiction over false and deceptive practices—in this case, failing to abide by a company’s own disclosed policies for handling user-collected information.",
  "Downes: In the Cambridge case, we still don’t know what information was used, how it was used, and to what extent Facebook should be held responsible for a third party’s actions—whether or not Facebook was even in contract with Cambridge, for example, or whether any of the data disclosed violated the company’s published policies or existing consent decree.",
  "It is asking us to consider the difference in value between an individual’s personal information when that information is used as specified in Facebook’s terms and conditions and when that information is allowed to “leak” to additional parties via lax enforcement of Facebook’s rules (i.e., when not used as specified in Facebook’s terms and conditions).",
  "These are expensive and probably of little value, but I don’t know what Tim is referring to when he says the “problems we are dealing with now.” Again, so much is being made of Cambridge without any of the relevant facts being clear—it’s a red herring, and a convenient rhetorical device, but not a basis for sound policymaking, at least not yet.",
  "For example, it has called for the elimination of antiquated immunities (like the immunity for common carriers and non-profits), asked that its privacy and data security authority be clarified, asked for regulatory and civil penalty authority, called for legislation to improve transparency and accountability for data brokers.",
  "McSweeny: For practices that are inconsistent with such expectations, the FTC has advocated that companies provide meaningful opt-in choices particularly for the collection of sensitive information (content of communications; health, financial and children’s information; precise TV viewing; geolocation).",
  "Singer: Some like David Dayen in the New Republic have called for banning targeted advertising generally, arguing that “[t]his manner of advertising doesn’t serve the public and it’s not even clear it serves advertisers.” He and others might consider the end of “customizing the experience” a good thing.",
  "Downes: To be clear, the Obama restrictions were never implemented—Congress reversed the FCC’s last-minute rulemaking before anything actually happened, so it’s not as if we have any basis to test the effectiveness or otherwise of the two different regimes implemented by two different agencies.",
  "But it’s clear that consumers don’t distinguish between different actors in the Internet ecosystem, and there was no reason for two different standards, other than the fact that the FCC claimed it couldn’t apply its opt-in regime to anyone other than ISPs—hardly a strong basis for policymaking.",
  "I just don’t know which half.” So with higher information costs for collecting user data and the risks of existential fines, content providers will collect less or perhaps no personal information, which will make advertising less effective and therefore play a lesser role in the cost equation.",
  "Likewise, there was no reason for having two different agencies with different standards, other than the fact that the FCC’s reclassification of ISPs as public utilities explicitly cut off the FTC’s authority—which had been actively on the job all along until the 2015 FCC action.",
  "Facebook now suffers from the TMI (too much information) of options—in response to advocate demands, the amount of granularity on privacy controls is so detailed that most users can’t figure out what’s important to them and very likely haven’t bothered to penetrate the choices.",
  "McSweeny: The prescription—the institutional structure (e.g., a data rights board, FTC, Robots commission)—probably matters less than properly scoping “the privacy problem.” For example, not much is actually known about the effects of the latest targeting technology at scale.",
  "So by cutting off (without any rigorous evidence of harm) the option of cheaper alternatives subsidized by information collection and use, regulators are taking away the Internet that most consumers enjoy and forcing them to a paid model that many won’t be able to afford.",
  "So, for example, the FTC has alleged both economic harms (e.g., direct financial harm, forms identity theft, legal expenses, reputational injury) and emotional harms (e.g., unwarranted privacy invasion resulting in injury in the form of depression, anxiety, safety fears).",
  "Doesn’t this imply that the dislocations and higher subscription fees you envision will be limited to a particular class of online models—namely, just those firms that license data out to third parties, and let them do their own processing for research and advertising?",
  "Singer: Speaking of a Data Rights Board—an idea I happen to like—based on my experience on the antitrust side of the FTC, I’ve concluded there is no forum in which a complainant (competitor or consumer) can initiate a proceeding against a dominant tech platform.",
  "Eduardo cited a study by three economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimating that the “free” digital economy powered by advertising that drives Facebook’s and Google’s business added 0.11 percentage points to the U.S. economy from 2005 through 2015.",
  "Indeed, Senators Markey and Blumenthal introduced the CONSENT Act on the heels of Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony, which would require the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish privacy protections for people who use online platforms like Facebook and Google.",
  "The Chat covered a range of topics, from revenge porn to online scams, and was organized around three major questions: (1) why should we be doing privacy protection; (2) who should be doing privacy protection; and (3) how much privacy protection is needed?",
  "Perhaps that’s not as stark a problem in the expert agencies, but who would trust Congress to write laws to regulate technologies they don’t understand and don’t seem the least bit concerned in revealing publically just how uninterested they are?",
  "She was joined by Rob Seamans, Associate Professor of Management and Organizations at the Stern School of Business at NYU, and Larry Downes, fellow Forbes contributor and project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.",
  "One way to do that is for the FTC to create a forum, overseen by an independent factfinder/ALJ/tribunal, to adjudicate disputes relating to online privacy (by any firm) or online discrimination (by any vertically integrated platform) or both.",
  "I limited the respondents to dominant tech platforms in my question because it was based on my antitrust experience—and we wouldn’t want to expose a non-dominant (or non-vertically integrated) platform to, say, a nondiscrimination standard.",
  "None of those proposing these “remedies” have any experience actually working with regulatory agencies tasked with overseeing complex industries, let alone emerging innovations and technologies for which there is no expertise to be had.",
  "As has been the case since the original media models on which the Internet’s grand bargain was based, advertisers subsidize the costs of content creation and distribution, whether it’s newspapers, radio, television, or Google searches.",
  "McSweeny: The FTC’s first privacy cases focused mostly on transparency and consent, but over time the FTC has targeted enforcement to address reasonable consumer expectations regarding the collection, use, and protection of their data.",
  "McSweeny: The FTC’s general approach to consumer choice has focused on whether the collection and use of information is consistent with the context of a consumers’ interaction with a company and the consumers’ reasonable expectations.",
  "Note that the Seventh Circuit recently allowed a data-breach class action to proceed against Neiman Marcus despite the lack of current harm to credit card holders, and reinstated the data-breach class action against Barnes and Noble.",
  "Just like it is difficult to describe which platforms to be regulated, it is also difficult to describe which data should be subject to opt-in, especially given how fast these technologies, and the data needed for them, are changing.",
  "Downes: Nearly all of the privacy-related cases were settled, which would be fine and, as Commissioner McSweeny says, more efficient—so long as the agency published analysis of the case that would give future guidance to others.",
  "But its incremental, harms-based approach is reactive and remains heavily rooted in the rational choice theory which is based on the idea that properly informed individuals will make reasonable decisions regarding their data.",
  "Firms will have less data than before, so it is likely that algorithms which rely on less data (e.g., using Bayesian approaches) will become more popular, and you’ll start to see a whole lot of startups focus on this space.",
  "Rob Seamans: The biggest potential harm to consumers is fraud—i.e., the risk that someone uses your personally identifiable information to pretend to be you, and open credit cards in your name or deplete your bank account.",
  "But, I don’t think it bears directly on privacy, unless the portability also requires the platform to remove all traces of the customer (this would mean there are fewer copies of a person’s PII floating around out there).",
  "(And the Times article, which ran alongside a nearly identical piece in the Wall Street Journal, was about how Google and Facebook could integrate into ad-serving functionality, displacing third-party ad tech firms.",
  "Downes: Most of your examples are certainly covered by the GDPR—and the fines for breaches by criminal third parties to the data collector will prove a strong disincentive to do anything customized or personalized.",
  "There was an interesting article this week in the New York Times that notes the big platforms will likely benefit from more regulation, because they can afford to game the system, while smaller competitors can’t.",
  "McSweeny: My view is that policies that introduce a little restraint in the mass-data extraction/exploitation system may be both pro-consumer and pro-competitive given the current incentives in the market.",
  "Writing in The Atlantic, Ethan Zuckerman argued that “We need to treat personally identifiable information less like a resource to be exploited and more like toxic waste, which must be carefully managed.",
  "Probably the worst sin of limiting data collection would be that the decisions of what data to limit and how limits would be policed would slow the pace of the Internet ecosystem to that of regulators.",
  "And there are models where for a fee to third parties, they will also promote third-party products and services, using their targeting data but the information remains internal to the initial retailer.",
  "It’s true that Apple has been wildly successful offering a largely impersonal, premium set of products and services that are available elsewhere for less money with information-subsidized alternatives.",
  "There is also little evidence that consumers understand how their data are being used and some evidence to suggest they may be relatively easy to manipulate depending on the choices they are offered.",
  "The FTC has challenged situations where defaults were set to public sharing—such as in its recent Venmo case—and when default was set to allow data collection and sharing—such as in its Vizio case.",
  "Congress recently nullified the FCC’s privacy rules, and with the re-reclassification of ISPs away from common carriers, it appears that the FTC now has the authority to police both sets of actors.",
  "A tribunal that included one or two experts (say, an engineer and an economist or both) could quickly adjudicate disputes on the Internet involving, among other things, alleged privacy violations.",
  "It should have regulatory and civil penalty authority and its jurisdiction must be clarified; it should further elevate the role of technologists in its work; and it needs to be properly funded.",
  "Such torts, including false light, invasion of privacy, and the like, were never really embraced, and the few states that did have largely eliminated them, largely on First Amendment concerns.",
  "Singer: During his testimony, Mark Zuckerberg was willing to embrace GDPR-style opt-in rules, but only for certain data that he considered particularly sensitive, such as facial recognition.",
  "Eduardo Porter asked an important question in his recent privacy piece in the New York Times—namely, “What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect?",
  "Consider the recent lawsuit against Facebook brought by the founder of MoneySavingExpert, over claims that Facebook has published more than 50 fake posts bearing his name in the last year.",
  "It includes protections the FTC has advocated for here in the U.S.—like more transparency and accountability for data brokers and rights for consumers to access, correct, and export data.",
  "They certainly didn’t catch the problems we are dealing with now.” He suggested that the FTC should force itself to do a re-investigation of the target after some period like three years.",
  "Singer: There could a problem with error-cost analysis in the privacy context, in the sense that if you can never repair some errors—say, the leak of a disease or one’s sexual preference.",
  "And Makan Delrahim, the head of DOJ’s Antitrust Division, quoted Foer in a speech at Larry’s alma mater (University of Chicago Law School) last week, which means the analogy must hold.",
  "Downes: Oh no, if we did switch to opt-in we’d quickly realize that it isn’t the panacea that advocates claim, and, indeed, consumers would grow frustrated with so many interruptions.",
  "And because nearly all FTC enforcement actions result in consent decrees, there’s very little common law actually developed that gives companies guidance on what to do and not to do.",
  "Other last-generation tech billionaires are having great fun jumping on the “tech is toxic” bandwagon, but there’s never any actual studies or specificity to the remedies proposed.",
  "They want to be seen as above petty mercantilism and the defenders of expanded human rights, but when the rubber hits the road, it’s a mess that someone else will have to clean up.",
  "Downes: The Europeans didn’t draw the line—they defined personal information extremely broadly (and vaguely too, a source of future problems) and subjected everything to opt-in.",
  "Singer: And you think it’s better to have a different court address these harms each time they arise, relative to a single, expert tribunal, operating inside or outside the FTC?",
  "Under the Obama administration, Internet service providers (ISPs) were subjected to more stringent privacy restrictions than dominant tech platforms such as Facebook and Google.",
  "Singer: It seems like Europe’s embrace of GDPR provides a natural experiment with which to gauge the incremental benefits and costs of tightening the restrictions on user data.",
  "Our framework relies heavily—many would say too heavily—on individuals adequately understanding the potential risks of sharing their data at the time they choose to share it.",
  "Indeed, you characterize Europe’s GDPR regulations as the “End of the Grand Bargain.” Can you explain how we get to higher user prices and whether that is good or bad thing?",
  "Surely, as Coase made clear decades ago, a worse and less efficient solution, one filled with negative unintended consequences, regulatory capture problems, and paternalism.",
  "That may be a slip that tells us everything we need to know about the effectiveness of regulated solutions…\n\nSinger: You mean the FTC considers Facebook to be its client?",
  "There is e-commerce, performed as Apple envisioned it, where the transaction is frictionless, but you pay for everything, much like a brick-and-mortar retail environment.",
  "Singer: The social utility of the automotive industry is far clearer than that of highly targeted advertisements, but I suppose that could be a matter of personal taste.",
  "Seamans: As someone who does economics of innovation, I need to point out another angle here, which is how GDPR will shift the trajectory of innovation in this space.",
  "Seamans: This is similar to the suggestion that the FTC and DOJ be “forced” to check in on the various “behavioral remedies” that may be imposed as part of a merger.",
  "But look, the real risk here isn’t burying users in opt-in demands (which are all differently worded) that will explode with smart phone apps and IoT applications.",
  "Downes: I don’t see what it is about privacy violations that distinguishes them from other torts, or at least that would suggest the need for expedited resolution.",
  "Singer: It sounds like you are arguing that we refrain from regulating the waste dumps and instead regulate what happens to the waste regardless of who touches it.",
  "Which is the real point of any remedy—not so much to punish the wrong-doer as to establish future guidance for others to avoid behaviors we now deem to be harmful.",
  "Many of the FTC’s recent privacy cases have focused on companies’ deceptive failure to clearly disclose their information collection, use, and sharing practices.",
  "Americans have had a lot of confidence in placing trust in technology—I think it is healthy to have a conversation about whether that trust is taken for granted.",
  "McSweeny: It isn’t worth re-litigating this—so I’ll just say that I think Congress’ repeal of the FCC’s broadband privacy rule was a big step back for consumers.",
  "I just got back from two weeks in the EU, and counted 150 times I had to agree to accept cookies from a website, including repeated agreement on the same sites.",
  "Singer: Yes GDPR is more than just opt in, but opt in is a big thrust of GDPR, as well as the new privacy bill being advanced by Senators Markey and Blumenthal.",
  "Downes: Well the digital divide is now much more about older/younger, urban/rural, educated/less educated than it is about income, but I agree with Rob’s point.",
  "I appreciate the question, but I don’t think it is fair to lay our collective failure to enact stronger data rights for U.S. consumers at the feet of the FTC.",
  "As lawmakers continued to demonstrate during the Zuckerberg hearings, there is a high level of ignorance in Congress of what the Internet is and how it works.",
  "But do people, especially when they are first signing up for the service at whatever age one now joins Facebook, understand the implications of their choice?",
  "For example, Tim Wu told FTC Watch in an interview that “The FTC relied on third-party audits, but from what I’ve seen of the audits, they were superficial.",
  "The FTC doesn’t have APA rulemaking authority outside of specific statutes like Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.",
  "Singer: Given the drumbeat for GDPR-type rules in the United States after L’Affaire Cambridge, did the FTC goof by allowing opt-out for the edge providers?",
  "The point of disruptive innovation is that it isn’t predictable—its course, speed and trajectory are left to the whims of fast-changing consumer demands.",
  "As the technology we use in our daily lives becomes stronger and our connections more intimate, retaining that trust is more complex and more important.",
  "This seems to reward companies for having very long privacy policies that are nonetheless eventually clear about not keeping the customers’ data secret.",
  "Public goods economics would have to be considered in a legal action claiming lost value from information dissemination, as in other public goods torts.",
  "There is the Amazon or Target model, where your purchases are tracked internally, so that the retailer can market to you to sell you more of its stuff.",
  "So when an investment expert’s face is misappropriated on Facebook to peddle an investment scam, he should take the matter to a court outside the FTC?",
  "If your face is misappropriated to sell shady investment advice, what is the source of your rights to ask Facebook to remove the fake endorsement?",
  "Singer: You’d think Facebook would have avoided the Cambridge deal on first sight, anticipating the FTC’s likely negative view of the arrangement.",
  "In general, absent measurable financial harm (e.g., identity theft), U.S. tort law doesn’t historically recognize ephemeral or subjective harm.",
  "Singer: If the consumer harm is so ephemeral, as you suggest, then it’s hard to justify more stringent protections under any cost-benefit rule.",
  "While this is interesting, it only gives us an upper bound estimate of the costs associated with eliminating all data via maximal restrictions.",
  "And if anyone says “Lose the innovation race to China,” as Zuckerberg repeated ad nauseam during his testimony, I will cut them off this chat.",
  "The real drawback to the FTC’s approach, as I noted above, is that it doesn’t adjudicate or publish opinions—it just gets the consent decrees.",
  "But I also think that expert regulators need to apply what they know about the industries they regulate to privacy and data security policy.",
  "But other than complicating interactions and raising costs with little to no benefit, opt-in and opt-out don’t seem to make much difference.",
  "Are there process reforms on either the antitrust and consumer protection front (or both) that might bring more effective relief at the FTC?",
  "Before we start quantifying costs and benefits, what is the general nature of the costs of limiting data for these companies at the margin?",
  "In this edition of the #BytesChat, we convened a panel of tech experts to discuss the fast-moving developments on the online privacy front.",
  "The problem with more disclosures is, just like with refinancing a mortgage, you get so much paper that you can't find the important stuff.",
  "Opt-in here is hundreds of decisions with little indication of their importance—thousands when the Internet of Things gets into high gear.",
  "Seamans: You are asking a bunch of questions, and I’ll respond with questions of my own: Can anyone initiate a proceeding against anyone?",
  "That difference is going to be pretty small, but bounded between $0 and $215—i.e., you get less than $215 (especially after lawyer fees).",
  "With that in mind, a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation would be to divide Facebook’s public market valuation by the number of users.",
  "Seamans: Rajshree makes a great point that users of Facebook (or any tech offering) need to be a bit wiser and bear some responsibility.",
  "How we measure that I’m not sure—number of start-ups, IPOs, venture-based investments, number of companies in Mary Meeker’s Top 30, etc.",
  "But I think one consequence is that companies must have a much greater understanding of whose data they have and how they are using it.",
  "Second, there was no limitation in The Economist article for who could be a respondent in a privacy complaint at the Data Rights Board.",
  "What do we stand to gain?” As an economist, I am intrigued by what happens at the margin as we tighten these restrictions on data uses.",
  "Our special guest was Terrell McSweeny, who served as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission from April 2014 though April 2018.",
  "But most of us don’t realize the number of different ways in which our information gets used, traded, and combined once we give it up.",
  "Instead, edge rivals are forced to endlessly knock on doors, hoping to entice a libertarian-leaning economist to take up their plight.",
  "So we’re not establishing any common law of what is acceptable and unacceptable practice, how we measure harm, how we define remedies.",
  "Moreover, the two different standards would be applied by two different agencies: the FCC (for ISPs) and the FTC (for edge providers).",
  "How do we draw the line on what sort of information should be considered sufficiently sensitive such that opt-in rules are preferred?",
  "In some of these cases there is also direct financial injury, like the cost of attorneys fees to remove identifiable intimate images.",
  "I don’t know why he’s taking cheap shots at privacy advocates and academics though—aren’t these his Harvard Business Review readers?",
  "The real question is not whether rational economic actors are a good or bad assumption but rather what better alternative there is.",
  "Singer: How radically do you think users’ choices would change if the default privacy settings were changed from opt out to opt in?",
  "The Internet’s success has been based on network effects—getting more connections of people, devices, and information compounding.",
  "As Nilay Patel commented, “Oh no what will happen if there isn’t enough entrepreneurial activity in European ad tech nooooooooo!)",
  "Terrell McSweeny: I think fraud is a real harm—like Rob says, but there are lot of harms that are also serious—including safety.",
  "Other than that, we as consumers don’t seem to value privacy that much, as recent research by Athey, Catalini and Tucker show.",
  "What is it about the history of the EPA that suggests something similar would help, rather than hurt, the information economy?",
  "It’s not clear how Cambridge got the data, so it’s not clear whether it would have been any different under an opt-in regime.",
  "And you were thinking “Maybe data portability and a Data Rights Board aren’t so bad after all!” Thanks for joining, everyone!",
  "What $ amount of damages have I suffered?” Some tech libertarians quote tweeted it, suggesting that the harms were ephemeral.",
  "Downes: Just because some errors can’t be corrected doesn’t mean you give up the mechanism that might generate such errors.",
  "I’d point out that litigation is time consuming, slow (often outpaced by fast moving tech markets), and resource intensive.",
  "This may require a digital EPA, as Franklin Foer, Paul Ford, and other have argued.” What do you think of these proposals?",
  "Obviously there are information asymmetries here, and the problem of over-disclosure of choices, as well as externalities.",
  "Largely this is about changing the default settings, not the government making the choices for us (socialist paternalism).",
  "Lots of the ideas being peddled by The Economist (and by me) could be done inside the FTC, but with tweaks to the process.",
  "Singer: Larry, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.",
  "I suspect we’ll see a lot of innovative new algorithmic techniques that rely on less data (such as Bayesian techniques).",
  "It’s the kinds of arbitrary and existential fines the GDPR includes—4% of revenue or EU 20 million, whichever is higher.",
  "The alternative is too much discretion for the trier of fact and difficulty for future parties to adjust their behavior.",
  "Generally I think it is worth talking about what consumers understand about the data practices of the services they use.",
  "The FTC has also alleged, for example, that turning cameras on in people's bedrooms is unwarranted invasion of privacy.",
  "Does the FTC have the resources to do this effectively, including not just money and staff, but expertise and training?",
  "Singer: But to be fair, Larry, there are multiple Internet business models that are successful and not touched by GDPR.",
  "Both Republican and Democratic chairs of both agencies have agreed that there should be one standard and one enforcer.",
  "The alternative the EU seems to be moving toward is one where regulators decide for you what bargains are good or bad.",
  "Singer: Other observers believe the nature of the privacy problem defies the FTC, and that a new regulator is needed.",
  "All I’m saying is that the divide will get worse, not better, with aspirational data collection and use restrictions.",
  "Does the FTC need authorization or instructions from Congress to move to a European-like model of privacy protection?",
  "Singer: But Larry, what about the notion of a place for a private party to file a complaint and get its day in court?",
  "Surely we should be looking for a decline in innovation, in which Europe has long been the lagging economy all along.",
  "Per my point above, it will be interesting to see how this affects the types of algorithms that are being developed.",
  "It’s not that the FTC doesn’t adjudicate enough, it’s that they don’t give any guidance in the cases they do pursue.",
  "Larry, you have a new piece in Harvard Business Review that suggests one cost of limiting data use is new user fees.",
  "Or more generally, how would you estimate the marginal revenue product generated by an individual user for Facebook?",
  "There are a range of harms that can follow when consumers’ information is misused or accessed without authorization.",
  "Singer: You don’t envision social media charging the advertisers the same rate, but for slightly less targeted ads?",
  "The FTC has been critical in filling the gaps left by our sectorial approach to consumer privacy and data security.",
  "Something will have to replace declining ad dollars, so we move to more subscription/paywall/micro payment models.",
  "And neither of us figured the value of what Facebook brings to the transaction, namely its otherwise free service.",
  "For the most part, people understand they are giving up their privacy in exchange for access to a social network.",
  "Recall the lesson from Nudge, where participation in 401(k)s skyrocketed after the default settings were changed.",
  "Again, the definitions of personal information are open-ended, and the GDPR’s requirements apply to everything.",
  "Singer: The courts don't provide a forum for discrimination complaints against vertically integrated platforms.",
  "Hal Singer: Professor Randy Picker of University of Chicago had an interesting tweet about L’Affaire Cambridge.",
  "McSweeny: I’m not a behavioral economist but think there is very little evidence that homo economicus exists.",
  "McSweeny: The FTC does advocate for opt-in choices for consumers around collection and use of sensitive info.",
  "I think empowering consumers with more control over their data could inspire competition on privacy settings.",
  "And if Facebook won’t take down those offending posts, you’d want an expedited resolution to your complaint.",
  "See Haynes v. Knopf for a chilling right to be forgotten case I worked on in the Seventh Circuit as a clerk.",
  "Should we expect the same radical shift here, marked via a withdrawal of consent and drying up of user data?",
  "Maybe they don’t understand the implications of doing so, or maybe they don’t care, and maybe they’re right.",
  "Also probably a good moment to say I am giving you my personal views, and not the official views of the FTC.",
  "Singer: No, she wants the default settings to be set so that users must opt into allowing data to be shared.",
  "Seamans: Larry makes some good points about how certain business models may favor those with higher income.",
  "It seems to me that we could fight for years about what constitutes a particularly sensitive piece of data.",
  "What about firms with lots of data but that are not platforms, like banks, insurers and health care firms?",
  "Faced with the risk of such a fine, enterprises at the margins will simply not collect information at all.",
  "Singer: Let’s switch gears from why more privacy protection to who should be doing the privacy protection.",
  "People need to trust their data are being handled consistent with their expectations in order to share it.",
  "For me, the biggest revelation of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica issue is how few people realized this.",
  "As in my cookies experience, most users when asked too often to opt-in simply do it, over and over again.",
  "The name of the bill is the CONSENT Act, as in edge providers would need opt-in consent to use your data.",
  "Given this oddity in privacy economics, is the answer that tightened restrictions have to be the default?",
  "But I agree that opt-in for sensitive information isn’t a bad idea...depending on who defines sensitive.",
  "McSweeny: I think the FTC should always be open to new ideas, but I don’t agree with your criticism Hal.",
  "Retailing pioneer John Wannamker famously said, “I know half the money I spend on advertising is wasted.",
  "In broad strokes, what is the nature of the harm to users from under-enforcement of privacy protections?",
  ":) Also I’d be remiss if I didn't point out that we already have a digital divide that is income-based.",
  "In fact, the FTC advocates for an opt-in regime around the collection and use of sensitive information.",
  "Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Fred Campbell argues that this asymmetric treatment was misplaced.",
  "I was also pretty surprised by how uneducated our representatives in Congress are about these issues.",
  "We’ll have an Internet just for rich people—and a far more insular online dialogue than we have now.",
  "The FTC needs both tools and resources in order to adequately protect consumers in the digital age.",
  "Seamans: Terrell, I agree, but I don’t like the black/white approach to much of this in the media.",
  "And should the FTC be doing anything else with its existing set of tools to better police privacy?",
  "So I favor an approach where expert regulators like FCC, NHTSA, FDA work with FTC on these issues.",
  "What it does have is authority to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive acts and practices.",
  "But I don’t think we have any consensus on the proper metrics by which to judge those tradeoffs.",
  "Singer: Expert in applying whatever privacy (or nondiscrimination) standard Congress gives them.",
