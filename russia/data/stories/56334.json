  "I'm going through Lake's story now, and will try to post something more detailed later, but there are a couple of other discoveries that suggest strongly that Parsi is operating as a lobbyist, including this:\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement experts who reviewed some of the documents... say e-mails between Mr. Parsi and Iran's ambassador to the United Nations at the time, Javad Zarif - and an internal review of the Lobbying Disclosure Act - offer evidence that the group has operated as an undeclared lobby and may be guilty of violating tax laws, the Foreign Agents Registration Act and lobbying disclosure laws....\n\n\n\nE-mail correspondence between Mr. Parsi and Mr. Zarif show Mr. Parsi suggesting that the Iranian diplomat meet with members of Congress.",
  "Eli Lake has come up with some very interesting evidence about Parsi's activities in Washington, including an internal memo from the group's policy director, Patrick Disney, in which he states that NIAC is, in fact, functioning as a lobby:\n\n\n\n(I)n a July 2008 memo obtained by The Times, Mr. Disney quoted the Lobbying Disclosure Act - a law that says even the preparation of materials aimed at influencing legislation or policy must be disclosed to the public - and said he and a colleague should register as lobbyists.",
  "I was trying to suggest, in a not-so artful way, that Parsi is trying to build his organization into an Iranian version of AIPAC, but \"leg-work\" seemed, in retrospect, like too harsh a description for his activities.",
  "Arranging meetings between foreign officials and members of Congress in order to influence legislation -- the point of meeting with members of Congress, of course -- is an essential aspect of lobbying.",
  "The tax code allows nonprofits to devote less than 20 percent of their activities to lobbying if they declare the activity in a special section on their taxes.",
  "When asked about his policy director's memo, Mr. Parsi said that Mr. Disney is not a lawyer and that when he wrote the memo, he was new to the organization.",
  "A couple of weeks ago, I retracted my assertion that Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, did \"leg-work\" for the Iranian regime.",
  "\"Under this expansive view of 'lobbying,' I find it hard to believe Emily, and I devote less than 20 percent of our time to lobbying activity.",
  "There are many more that are interested in a meeting, including many respectable Democrats,\" Mr. Parsi wrote in an Oct. 25, 2006, e-mail.",
  "Parsi is on record as opposing sanctions on Iran, a position the Iranian regime, and its representatives at the U.N., obviously endorse.",
  "I believe we fall under this definition of 'lobbyist,' \" he wrote, referring to NIAC's legislative director at the time, Emily Blout.",
  "NIAC's latest tax form shows that the group has declared that it spends none of its time lobbying.",
  "\"Happy to hear that you will meet with [Rep. Wayne] Gilchrest and potentially [Rep. James] Leach.",
  "But now I may have to retract my retraction."
