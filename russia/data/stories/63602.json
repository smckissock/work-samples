  "In response to the Journal’s story, Stone sent a text message claiming that Credico and WikiLeaks had “provided nothing” to him and that his testimony before the House intelligence committee was “complete and accurate.”\n\nInvestigators have scrutinized Stone for his claims that he communicated with both Assange and Guccifer 2.0, the Kremlin operative identified by U.S. officials as responsible for the DNC hack.",
  "The day before WikiLeaks published hacked emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone said Assange was going to deliver “a devastating expose of Hillary.” The emails were published the day the “Access Hollywood” tape was released of Trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.",
  "In September 2016, he apparently badgered radio personality Randy Credico to press Assange for emails related to Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal while she was secretary of state.",

  "Stone has long denied any involvement with the trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published during the 2016 campaign.",
  "Credico said he didn’t even pass along Stone’s message to Assange, whom he had interviewed for his radio program, but still told Stone that he had.",
  "But according to a series of emails The Wall Street Journal reviewed for its Thursday article, Stone did more than ask for confirmation.",
  "According to the Journal, Stone responded: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have??",
  "Stone tweeted during the election that he had a “back channel” to Assange, which could have meant Credico.",
  "The Mueller team may “conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business,” Stone said.",
  "“I can’t ask them favors every other day,” Credico complained, according to the Journal.",
  "Stone also appeared to know about WikiLeaks’ actions in advance.",
