  "The survey of 600 American Muslims, culled from those who had previously agreed to respond to such surveys, found that 29% agreed that “violence against those that insult the prophet Muhammad, the Qur’an, or Islamic faith is sometimes acceptable.” Also, 25% agreed that “violence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad.”\n\nExperts warn that an opt-in Internet survey is notoriously unreliable, and the Center for Security Policy itself cautions that the survey can’t be used to represent the American Muslim population at large, but rather “the results are of those individual Muslims polled.” TheWashington Post noted that the president and founder of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, is identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim extremist.",
  "“We can look around and say: Yes, terrorism is a real problem but do we actually see millions of Muslims — or in Trump’s telling hundreds of millions Muslims — either waging war against the U.S. or saying they would?”\n\nWhile we could find no Pew Research Center survey to back up Trump’s claim about the percentage of the world’s Muslims who want to go to war with the U.S., we did find recent Pew research that asked voters how the next president should talk about extremism and Islam.",
  "According to Pew research published in February, “about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65) – including seven-in-ten conservative Republicans (70 percent) – want the next president to speak bluntly about extremism even if it means being critical of Islam.” By contrast, 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents “say the next president should be careful not to criticize Islam as a whole.”\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pwXKSo",
  "Pew Research Center also found that “most people in several countries with significant Muslim populations have an unfavorable view of the terrorist group ISIS, including virtually all respondents in Lebanon and 94 percent in Jordan.” This refers to the terrorist group Islamic State — also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).",
  "One expert we talked to called Trump’s claim “nonsense.” Another told us it had “no scientific basis.”\n\nTrump’s statement came when Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Trump about his blanket statement during a March 9 interview on CNN that “Islam hates us.” (Trump doubled down on that statement during the Republican debate the following night.)",
  "“As far as I know there is no scientific basis for that statement.”\n\nWe also reached out to Shadi Hamid, senior fellow for the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, and asked him about Trump’s claim.",
  "Trump: \"Why don’t you take a look at the Pew poll that came out very recently or fairly recently, where I think the number — I mean, I could be corrected, it’s whatever it is — but it’s something like 27% are, you know, really very militant about going after things.",
  "However, in December, Trump released a statement that called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,” and cited Pew Research and one other survey.",
  "“I don’t know where Mr. Trump got the figure of 27 or 35 percent of Muslims that want to go to war with the U.S.,” Angel Rabasa, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation who has written extensively about extremism, told us via email.",
  "“The Center has not issued a survey saying that 27 percent of Muslims would go to war with the US, nor has the Center asked a question of Muslims about ‘going to war,’ ” Dana Page, a spokeswoman for the Pew Research Center, told us in an email.",
  "For example, more than a quarter of Muslims in a few countries responded that violence against civilians is at least sometimes justified in defense of Islam, including the Palestinian territories (46%), Lebanon (29%) and Bangladesh (47%).",
  "We reached out to the Pew Research Center — a nonpartisan group that conducts public opinion polling but does not take policy positions — and a spokeswoman told us it has not conducted any survey that fits Trump’s description.",
  "“The short answer is: It’s nonsense,” said Hamid, author of “Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle Over Islam Is Reshaping the World.” “Either Trump imagined the poll or misunderstood whatever the poll was saying.",
  "In any case, none of these results speaks to Trump’s claim that 27% or more “would go to war” with the U.S. And experts we spoke with said they knew of no other surveys that found — or even asked — such a thing.",
  "Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing '25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad.'",
  "On Fox News Sunday, Wallace said that among the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, “according to the best experts, think tanks around the world, they say at most, 100,000 people are fighting for jihadist causes.",
  "Pew did publish a report in 2014 that generally found concern about Islamic extremism is high among countries with substantial Muslim populations, and that the concern was growing in the Middle East.",
  "The survey doesn’t represent all Muslims living in the United States — only those surveyed who purported to be Muslim — let alone the world’s Muslims, which was Trump’s claim on Fox News Sunday.",
  "For example, in Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, 89% said suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are rarely or never justified.",
  "That’s less than — it’s a tiny fraction of 1%.”\n\nTrump said Wallace’s figure was “about as wrong as you can get” and that “27%, could be 35%, would go to war.” Trump cited Pew as his source.",
  "(Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)\n\nTrump wrongly claimed that a Pew Research Center survey found that among the world’s Muslims, “27%, could be 35%, would go to war” against the U.S.",
  "It found that overall, few Muslims endorse “suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian targets as a means of defending Islam against its enemies,” Page said.",
  "Page noted that the question on whether violence against civilians is ever justified does not specify a particular country (such as the U.S.) or group (such as Christians).",
  "But those who expressed support for violence to defend Islam from its enemies didn’t say, nor were they asked, if they “would go to war” with the U.S., as Trump claims.",
  "And strong majorities in most countries with substantial Muslim populations have unfavorable opinions of al Qaeda, the group responsible for the 9/11 attacks.",
  "Trump, March 13: \"You’re saying that out of 1.5 billion, 100,000, right — let me tell you, whoever did that survey was about as wrong as you can get.",
  "However, there were a few countries where “substantial minorities believe suicide bombing can be often justified or sometimes justified,” Page said.",
  "Trump, Dec. 7, 2015: \"According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.",
  "...\"\n\nThe other survey referenced by Trump was an unscientific, opt-in online poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy in June 2015.",
  "The Pew Research Center says it has conducted no survey that asks such a question, nor did experts we consulted know of any such survey.",
  "Wallace: \"… Wait, wait, you’re saying 250 — you’re saying 250 — 300 million Muslims would go to war against us?\"",
  "“Luckily, we don’t even have to pretend to take the claim seriously, since it’s absurd on its face,” Hamid said.",
  "We emailed Trump’s campaign to ask what survey Trump may have been referring to, but we did not hear back.",
  "It’s 27%, could be 35%, would go to war, would — the hatred is tremendous, Chris.\"",
  "Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Tampa, Fla., on March 14, 2016.",
  "\"But, look, there’s something going on, Chris, whether you like it or not.",
  "And radical Islamic terrorism is taking place all over the world.\"",
  "It would be easier for me to say, 'Oh, no, everybody loves us.'",
  "But those countries were the exception rather than the rule.",
  "It’s not 100,000 people, I can tell you that.",
  "But it’s a very significant number.",
  "\"And you’ll have to look at it.",
  "But there’s something going on.",
  "They did a very strong study.",
  "And let’s see what it says.",
  "It’s a ridiculous number.",
  "There’s a big problem."
