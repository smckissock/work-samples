  "In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Fiorina remarked that “of course” Clinton’s emails were “compromised,” adding that Clinton simply “doesn’t understand technology very well.”\n\nHEWITT: You are a technology executive, first woman ever to be a Fortune 20 CEO, and it was at Hewlett-Packard, a technology company.",
  "My second reaction was that she clearly doesn’t understand technology very well, because when she starts talking about it’s safe, it’s safe, we have two Secret Service agents guarding it, you know, as I think I’ve said to you before, no one’s worried about it getting stolen.",
  "There is no doubt, there is no doubt that nations like Russia, China, North Korea, have been engaged in a long-standing plan to attack various systems and databases in this country, beginning with, but not ending with, the federal government.",
  "If the White House is, if that’s even possible, then we know, because Sidney Blumenthal, who was writing to the former secretary of state’s emails ended up with Guccifer putting them out, that her emails were compromised.",
  "Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina kept up the heat on Hillary Clinton Tuesday, slamming her for not properly storing her emails in the wake of a report that Russia hacked the White House.",
  "There’s no other reason that you would put a server in your basement for the kind of classified, sensitive information that she would be sharing and transmitting as secretary of state.",
  "And when we have Sony, J.P. Morgan/Chase, Home Depot, Target, all of these companies being systemically hacked, they certainly can get into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server.",
  "What was your reaction upon learning of that as a technology executive aware of the security challenges of maintaining privacy and security?",
  "There’s no doubt it’s been going on, which is why you see even in this White House, alarm now about cyberwarfare.",
  "HEWITT: You know, Carly Fiorina, I don’t know that you’ve seen the headline, because it happened today.",
  "Yes, and by the way, I chaired the advisory board at the Central Intelligence Agency for several years.",
  "One was that clearly, she had a plan to shield her communications from prying eyes.",
  "There is a report that the White House was hacked by Russia.",
  "The former secretary of state installed a home brew server.",
  "So of course, her emails were compromised.",
  "They’re worried about it getting hacked.",
  "FIORINA: Well, I had two reactions.",
  "We know, don’t you assume that?",
  "FIORINA: Yes."
