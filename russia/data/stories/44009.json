  "But while some tech innovations might appear as inscrutable as magic, they tend not to work nearly as well, says Meredith Broussard, whose new book, “Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World” (MIT Press, $24.95) warns against the blind optimism toward technology — an attitude she calls “technochauvinism” — that she argues has dominated our culture for far too long.",
  "If I can’t understand it, there are a lot of other people out there who also can’t understand it and are probably not going on the record to say, “I can’t understand this.” If you’re a classroom teacher, and you don’t understand the Common Core standards, who are you going to talk to?",
  "“I started to question the promises of tech culture.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and the first pedestrian death caused by a self-driving car, this line of questioning, it seems, is now on everybody’s mind.",
  "You also need to have a lot of tech support, so that when a student’s computer goes down in the middle of class, there is somebody who will come over immediately to fix the problem, so that the whole lesson doesn’t come crashing to a halt.",
  "In the book, you say that data journalists are often the ones that do \"algorithmic accountability\" reporting –– stories that investigate the social consequences of using technology to make decisions.",

  "Science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously stated 45 years ago that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Today, advanced technology is commonplace.",
  "But you go on to cite the controversy over Common Core as “an example of what happens when engineering solutions are applied to social problems.” Was this an example of technochauvinism?",
  "When the communes failed, they thought, “We have this new thing called cyberspace, and we’re going to take the same ideology and do that in cyberspace.” It didn’t work there, either.",
  "What I’ve realized after being a software developer and being in the high-tech world for many years is that we can’t automatically assume the technological solution is the best one.",

  "If you look at something like the Follower Factory project [at the New York Times] or one of Julia Angwin’s projects, there are a lot of people who work on those investigations.",
  "You write that “Computer systems are proxies for the people who made them.” A lot of these people, you say, were naive about how their technological creations would be used.",
  "For example, when you’re teaching a kid to read, a board book is very helpful, because kids don’t have the manual dexterity to use a mouse until elementary school.",
  "[Note: A day after this interview, Angwin announced she was starting a news organization focused on tech investigations with her ProPublica colleague Jeff Larson.",
  "The whole Common Core situation is a mess for a lot of complicated reasons, not just that there was an element of technochauvinism in some of the microdecisions.",
  "[In the leaked internal message, Facebook Vice President Andrew “Boz” Bosworth provocatively defended the company’s growth, no matter the cost.]",
  "I think you have to look at the people who are making these systems: their total disdain for the rule of law and their aversion to regulation.",

  "In the chapter about schools, you write about gaining appreciation for the Gates Foundation’s support for the Common Core State Standards.",
  "There’s a techno-libertarian thing that is really popular in Silicon Valley that has become the default political position [in tech].",
  "Doing a very high-level computational investigation takes 10 times as long as a regular investigation, and it takes far more people.",
  "In the One Laptop per Child initiative, they didn't think about all of the things that go along with implementing the technology.",
  "All of these logistical issues that technochauvinists did not think through contributed to the failure of One Laptop per Child.",
  "But there were other challenges, like teachers that weren’t sure how to integrate computer-based education into their lessons.",
  "I needed a term to encompass the kind of bias that says the technological solution is always better than every other solution.",
  "In order to use a mouse, you need to be able to tell your right from your left, which is something kids are not great at.",
  "One of the things about data journalism is that it’s actually far more expensive and time-consuming than anybody expects.",
  "The Follower Factory project was a great project led by Mark Hansen, who runs the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.",
  "There either weren’t lesson plans or the One Laptop per Child people were not shipping lesson plans in local languages.",
  "And every effort to give all the students laptops or iPads and replace something — that is usually technochauvinism.",

  "ICIJ [the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists] had the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers.",
  "As a woman of color in the high-tech industry, I had a very different experience than my white male colleagues.",
  "In the book, I talk about Latanya Sweeney, a Harvard professor who pointed out the racial bias in online ads.",
  "I’m working in a small but growing tradition of women of color critically examining technological systems.",

  "Things that are written to be impenetrable are not actually useful for teachers in the classroom.",
  "There also wasn’t enough individualized tech support, and there’s never enough Wi-Fi in schools.",
  "That was a collaborative project that came out of Mark Hansen’s computational journalism class.",
  "In “Democracy’s Detectives,” James T. Hamilton lays out the economic case for data journalism.",
  "That political position derives from the communalists [who advocated living on communes].",
  "So it’s going to be really hard for journalism organizations to compete or to catch up.",
  "Michael Keller is leading an algorithmic investigations team at the New York Times now.",
  "If you look at the starting salary for AI researchers, it’s around $300,000 [a year].",
  "Something like One Laptop per Child — that initiative is definitely technochauvinism.",
  "But I do not think that portable technology is a total replacement for anything else.",
  "So I don’t know that the Common Core initiative is an example of technochauvinism.",
  "There wasn’t a word that captured this particular kind of bias, so I invented one.",
  "I’m a college professor, and I can’t really understand what these standards mean.",
  "They dealt with that challenge by creating laptops you could charge with a crank.",
  "In newer schools that have wallboard, it’s easier for the signal to get through.",

  "These types of investigations are expensive and time-consuming.",
  "The whole self-regulation thing has not worked out very well.",
  "When you read the standards, they’re absolutely impenetrable.",
  "So I am pro-technology, and I am pro-technology in schools.",
  "I do think there’s a lot of technochauvinism in education.",
  "Your principal is not going to be able to change anything.",
