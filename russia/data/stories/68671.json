  "Trump's decision to weigh in -- telling The Washington Post over the weekend that not only was he nearly done with his own Affordable Care Act replacement plan, but that it would provide \"insurance for everybody\" -- at once riled Capitol Hill Republicans already in a sensitive position on the issue and underscored the fraught and unknown nature of a nascent relationship with Capitol Hill.",

  "Lawmakers are prone to roll their eyes when asked questions about Trump's tweets, pledge not to talk about them at all, as Sen. John McCain has done multiple times, or ignore Trump's latest surprise policy prescription entirely, as Sen. John Barrasso did Tuesday when asked about Trump's latest health care comments.",

  "Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's foray into health policy was perhaps best described by a senior Republican congressional aide with a long history of working through the complexities of the issue as \"not helpful.\"",

  "Even as Trump rattles off his policy goals in media interviews and via Twitter, he's largely left it to his legislative team to craft and execute those priorities on Capitol Hill, according to a transition official.",
  "House Speaker Paul Ryan has a direct line to incoming chief of staff and fellow Wisconsin Republican Reince Priebus, one he uses often, and has said repeatedly that he speaks to Trump by phone a few times per week.",

  "In a series of interviews with GOP lawmakers and staff over the course of the first two weeks of the new Congress, it's clear there is a genuine enthusiasm about the possibilities a Trump presidency presents.",
