  "“Given Brookfield’s experience in successfully redeveloping and repositioning major office assets in New York and other cities around the world, we are well placed to capitalize on that opportunity.” Brookfield Properties says it will manage 666 Fifth Avenue and invest in a “major redevelopment program to upgrade it.”\n\nTerms of the agreement were not made public.",

  "Kushner Cos. — the New York City-based real estate development and lending company controlled by the Kushner family — is nearing an agreement to off-load 666 Fifth Avenue, the 41-story office building it significantly overpaid for over a decade ago, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
  "People who have been involved in the talks have said that the proceeds would give the family enough to pay off the more than $1.1 billion of debt on the building and buy out its partner, Vornado Realty Trust, for $120 million so it can transfer 666 Fifth to Brookfield unencumbered.",
