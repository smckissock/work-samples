  "| Evan Vucci/AP Photo Judge considers whether Trump’s tweets should open up government’s dossier probe\n\nA federal judge is considering whether President Donald Trump’s own tweets could force the federal government to reveal more information about its efforts to verify the claims in the controversial privately compiled dossier about Trump’s alleged ties to Russia.",
  "“It could be based on other things.”\n\nAn attorney for the requesters told Mehta that, while Trump’s statements might have been based on his personal knowledge or media reports, without further clarification from the White House, the court should assume the president was communicating in his official capacity based on official knowledge.",
  "Under the Radar Blog Archives Select Date… November, 2018 October, 2018 September, 2018 August, 2018 July, 2018 June, 2018 May, 2018 April, 2018 March, 2018 February, 2018 January, 2018 December, 2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken to his favorite social media forum to denounce the so-called dossier as “fake.\"",
  "Trump has taken to his favorite social media forum to denounce the so-called dossier as “fake” and “discredited,” while also calling repeatedly for investigators to make public details about who funded creation of the document containing accurate, inaccurate and unverified assertions about the president.",
  "“If the White House or whatever defendant wants to clarify it, that’s their prerogative, but until that, there’s a factual discrepancy.”\n\nMehta responded by venturing into a subject rarely raised publicly in court: Trump’s calls for Hillary Clinton to be investigated and jailed.",
  "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard arguments Friday in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit testing whether Trump’s public statements foreclose the government’s ability to refuse to even confirm that officials attempted to verify the claims in the so-called dossier.",
  "Intelligence officials have acknowledged giving President Barack Obama and then-President-elect Trump a two-page synopsis of the dossier’s allegations, which include salacious claims Trump has denied about his conduct during a visit to Russia.",
  "Much of the 40-minute hearing at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., turned on whether Trump’s statements could or should be read to mean that government agencies had investigated the claims in the dossier and found them wanting.",
  "“When the president says Mr. Comey — former director Comey — brought the dossier to me, isn’t that an acknowledgement that the FBI possesses the dossier?” the judge asked, referring to comments Trump made in a New York Times interview.",
  "When Moss suggested that the court might need to order some sort of fact-finding exercise to figure out whether the president’s statements about the dossier were based on official or unofficial information, Mehta jumped in.",
  "Glass acknowledged that Trump could speak on behalf of federal agencies, but said the law requires agencies changes their approach on disclosure only when he discussed precisely what is sought in the FOIA request.",
  "Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that statements President Barack Obama and top advisers made on the topic essentially foreclosed the CIA’s efforts to refuse to confirm or deny whether it had any records on drones.",
  "“The standard as we perceive it is there has to be an exact match,” the Justice Department lawyer said, noting that some of the requests refer to a two-page synopsis of the dossier and not the dossier itself.",
  "However, Mehta referenced Justice Department policies limiting contacts with the White House and said those might require him to presume that Trump’s statements did not come from official DOJ information.",
  "“He’s also said his opponent did break the law,” the judge observed, asking whether that was Trump relaying an official Justice Department conclusion or just offering his personal opinion.",
  "The judge said the statements from Obama and the other officials were not an “exact match” but led to a logical inference that agencies like the CIA had to have records on the subject.",
  "Asked about that appeals court case, which is binding law for Mehta and other district court judges, Glass replied: “It’s seems to us that was a one-off.”\n\nMoss noted that the D.C.",
  "The so-called dossier was compiled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, at the request of Washington-based private investigation firm Fusion GPS.",
  "Glass also argued that Trump’s calls for the Justice Department and FBI to reveal who paid for the dossier did not mean those agencies actually had such information.",
  "Justice Department lawyer David Glass said the statement was still too vague to force the government to respond in greater detail to the FOIA requests and lawsuit.",
  "But when the judge asked whetherf any similar policy would preclude intelligence agencies from briefing the president on allegations about him, Glass demurred.",
  "Circuit case appeared to presume that Obama and the other officials were speaking based on official knowledge and not other kinds of information.",
  "“As much as I would like that, that is not necessarily something I would think is necessary at this point,” Moss replied.",
  "As he wrapped up the hearing, he simply said: “Lot of food for thought,” before promising to release a ruling soon.",
  "“He is not admitting the FBI or Justice Department necessarily know who’s paying for it,” the DOJ lawyer said.",
  "The lawsuit was filed by this reporter along with a pro-transparency group, the James Madison Project.",
  "Mehta repeatedly pointed out that in a 2013 case involving records about drone strikes, the D.C.",
  "The judge seemed to reject some of the finer distinctions the government was trying to draw.",

  "“None of them said where they got their information from,” the attorney said.",
  "One or more copies eventually ended up in the hands of the FBI last year.",
  "“There’s no inference that is possible,” Glass insisted.",
  "Do you want to depose the president?” the judge asked.",
