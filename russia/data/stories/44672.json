  "Zuckerberg and other executives have been able to use ephemeral messaging features — much like Snapchat, Signal, and other platforms focused on user privacy — which delete Facebook messages from recipients' inboxes after a certain period of time, features revealed Thursday by TechCrunch and confirmed by Facebook.",
  "Getty Images\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has special privacy features on the platform — a revelation that suggests the company has been operating a two-tiered privacy system that favors its leadership over its users.",
  "In the wake of the TechCrunch report, the company said Facebook plans to make the feature available more widely and will pause Zuckerberg and the other executives' use of them.",
  "Finally, it declined to say whether messages will disappear automatically as Zuckerberg’s did or via a user-set timer.",
  "The company also declined to say how long Zuckerberg has had the feature and what other executives had access to it.",
  "When BuzzFeed News asked Facebook when it would roll this out to users, it declined to provide a timeframe.",
  "Nor did Facebook explain just when it decided to roll out the feature more broadly.",
  "“Why does he grant himself more privacy rights than everybody else?”",
  "The second-class public system does not offer that option."
