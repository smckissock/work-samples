  "WILLIAMS: Well, I think their -- by the way, the premise of your question is right on target because at this point it looks to me like really what the Republicans are up against his embarrassment with the Republican base that they are not in position to pass repeal and replace after so many years, so much rhetoric and votes to undo ObamaCare and you have conservative lobbying groups here in town who are pressing hard, incising that they must repeal and replace or they will pay a price in 2018 in the midterms.",
  "You see that inside the White House, you have people, like Steve Bannon saying, yes, this will appeal to our base, to people who feel like they've lost jobs because of these trade deals that are unfair to American workers, but you get ten people on the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn and others saying, you know what, we don't want a trade war, we don't need that kind of static right now, the economy seems to be going along pretty well, we had good numbers this week, why would you want to disrupt that?",
  "WALLACE: Well, let's talk about the plan, because you and Senator Collins, Republican Senator Collins of Maine, who has said at this point that she's against the bill, the -- the Senate bill, with the -- your plan that you’re putting forward, here are some of the highlights, keep most ObamaCare taxes to pay for a replacement, allow states to keep most of ObamaCare if they want, for states that want a new system, auto enroll people in insurance so thy have to opt out, not opt in.",
  "PRIEBUS: No, it doesn't mean they’re off the hook, but what it means is, is that we’re not going to forgo progress simply because we have a disagreement in regards to this meddling in the United States election, what it means is that we need to move forward with things like a cease-fire in Syria, which is going to save a lot of lives, which we are doing I think starting today in southwestern Syria.",
  "And now, what's developing from that meeting, if you look at the article that Circa put out, is that the individual that set up the meeting may have been affiliated with Fusion GPS, which is opposition research firm that is being subpoenaed and talk to by the Senate Judiciary Committee about their role in putting together that phony dossier that people know about in regard to the president.",
  "But if New York and if California decide that they’re going to retain ObamaCare with all of the benefits, most of ObamaCare, with federal taxes, which is what your plan would do, conservative senators say in their states what you’re going to do away with ObamaCare, then the folks in their states are playing so New Yorkers can have bigger, better, richer health care coverage than they can.",
  "Let's start with the breaking news that in June of 2016, there was a previously undisclosed meeting, and let’s up all the players on the screen, Donald Trump, Jr., this was during the campaign, Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior advisor, and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort, met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, Natalia Veselnitskaya.",
  "And the argument against that is that you’re going to get healthy people, they’re going to buy the cheaper plan with less coverage because they’re healthy, and that means that the middle income people, who aren't covered by Medicaid, who have pre-existing conditions or serious problems are going to have these expensive comprehensive plans they won’t be able to afford.",
  "PRIEBUS: Well, look, I think what he may have been referring to is that Barack Obama put a red line in the sand and didn't actually follow through with the threat that he made in Syria and we find ourselves from -- we find ourselves behind the eight ball in Syria because nothing happened for many, many years and now, we are looking -- from the outside looking in.",
  "WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, let me bring you in on this because while there certainly were differences and the European leaders aren't happy about this, and in many cases kind of said, it's one against 19, I’m sure there are a lot of Trump voters who would say playing nice with the world hasn't helped them, particularly in the case of jobs that they’ve lost.",
  "Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov says that after Putin denied meddling in election, he, Trump, this is his quote, said that he had accepts these assertions, and that President Trump said, this is Lavrov quoting Trump, certain circles in the U.S. are still exaggerating, although they cannot prove this, the topic of Russia’s interference with the election.",
  "And so --\n\nHUME: Might I suggest that if the president had had a very tense meeting, centered entirely on the alleged meddling in the election, which appears clearly to have happened, and the meeting broke up in disagreement, with other issues on the backburner, that the president's critics would not have liked that better than what happened.",
  "PRIEBUS: No, actually, I think the American people should look at that as a massive positive about this president, that you have a president that doesn't just show up at the G-20 and sink into his chair and just suddenly agree with all of these European leaders across the table when it comes to issues that he disagrees on.",
  "KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no matter how far away the president travels from Washington, for example, the 4,000 miles to Hamburg, Germany, this White House is never terribly (ph) far away from the Russian meddling story, it was one of the topics heading into the G-20 and it is again coming out of the G-20.",
  "When you look at what President Trump did in Europe and recommitting ourselves to our NATO allies, committing ourselves to our partners in Europe, our partners across the world, committing ourselves to the values of the West, delivering a speech in Poland which many people said are the best speeches since Ronald Reagan.",
  "And on this question of whether or not the Senate is going to be able -- Republicans in the Senate -- to repeal and replace ObamaCare, we got this on Twitter from Ron Powell who writes, \"why, if they had eight years and multiple House votes to repeal did you not have an alternative ready when you took power?",
  "WALLACE: All right, the hot idea right now is Ted Cruz's plan, that he is offering under which each exchange, an insurer would -- could offer what are called skinny plans, cheaper plans with fewer benefits that people could buy but as long as they offer one plan that has all the benefits under ObamaCare.",
  "This -- while it is true that -- that it doesn't cut Medicaid, it slows the rate of growth of Medicaid, some people who now have coverage eventually would lose coverage, and it states that didn't expand Medicaid, there’s a tremendous concern that they’re going to be stuck in an inferior position.",
  "And so we know that there are things that can be done to strengthen the Affordable Care Act that Republicans and Democrats can agree on, things like removing the excise tax, making sure that we provide greater incentives for young people to be in the system so that we have a greater pool.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): There is that position of the United States on the one hand, but I’m very happy that all other G-20 heads of state and governments have agreed that the Paris agreement is irreversible.",
  "My personal bet would be that McConnell will find the votes and I think it's possible, if they get a package that can actually run from the most conservative member to the most moderate member in the Senate, that that will just be passed by the House without a conference.",
  "WALLACE: And then there is the idea that President Trump offered in a tweet a few days ago, and let's put this up on the screen, \"if Republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date.\"",
  "And so I think that now, you know, the Trump administration has done some things to really destabilize the system and I think insurers --\n\nWALLACE: But -- but in fairness, this is the point I was trying to take away from you is --\n\nEDWARDS: Wait, insurers -- I know.",
  "And in the end, remember, he starts the week by going to Warsaw, so between Theresa May in Britain and the Polish government in Warsaw, he’s also reminding the Europeans, the Europeans are split on a lot of issues, we don't happen to be with the chancellor on them.",
  "Many of these countries have been taking advantage of the United States and part of the reason why President Trump is in the White House is because he told the American people that the time is over for the rest of the world to take advantage of the United States.",
  "That's a decisive leader and that's who the G-20 leaders saw in Hamburg, as someone who is decisive, someone who is not afraid, someone who doesn’t kowtow, and stands up for himself when it comes to issues of disagreement like trade and the Paris agreement.",
  "On Trade, and the final communique, which acknowledge America's right to seek more trade equity abroad, Mr. Trump tweeted this Sunday: The G-20 Summit, a great success for the U.S. -- explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made.",
  "This was an extensive portion of the meeting and after going at it with President Putin more than once, two times, maybe even three times, the president at that point, after spending a large part of the meeting on the subject, moved on to other topics.",
  "EDWARDS: So, I want to -- well, I want to hear what moving forward means because the fact is, the Trump administration actually has been engaged in the Congress trying to loosen the sanctions and are not happy with the bill that came out of the Senate.",
  "And so, I think -- if you go back to some what I said, if you end up with two sets of tough guys and one of them has the largest economy, the largest military, the greatest reach in the world, probably that guy ends up winning if he is determined.",
  "Well, Speaker Gingrich, G19 was trending on Twitter this weekend because of the sharp differences between the president and all the other leaders, especially on climate change, but also as you heard my discussion with Reince Priebus on trade.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, how much should we make of what the two men said about Russian meddling, now you’ve got President Trump in a tweet this morning saying I’m going to move forward, Syria, North Korea, all the issues?",
  "I mean, if they actually have a cease-fire that actually works, which also, by the way, involves Israel and Jordan, that's the first time in the Syrian civil war that we will have actually had a joint American-Russian agreement that survived.",

  "I think people really want to get this done and I think McConnell -- I think -- again, you had a -- I think just now a senator who really understands this issue and who I think was able to outline, as a medical doctor, the right direction.",
  "If the Republicans, with control both houses and the White House, cannot do this on this matter, it signals that entitlement (ph) reform, which for budgetary and physical reasons and for the national economy needs to happen, cannot happen.",
  "So, yes, he believes that Russia probably committed all of these acts that we've been told of, but he also believes that other countries also participated in this --\n\nWALLACE: Let's move to the next subject, which is, what is the response?",
  "PRIEBUS: I don't think it's in half as much trouble as the media wanted to be in, just like it wasn't the case when we went through the House bill the second time around, everyone said that it was over and then a few days later it passed.",
  "CASSIDY: The nice thing about Cassidy-Collins, as you said, it’s a conservative, federalist approach which actually gives the state guidelines, gives every state their fair share and allows them to come up with the answer for their state.",
  "And so there are any number of things that can be done on a bipartisan basis and that's where I’d like to see this go, making sure that people like me with pre-existing conditions are able to get affordable health care the end of the day.",
  "If a country loses its ability to produce steel, it loses something in regards to national security, a country cannot find itself importing steel from China subjected to dumping of steel from other countries, and decreasing productivity.",
  "But you’re right, if you (INAUDIBLE) off the older and sicker in their own plan with their own risk pool, then you’ve just re-created the ObamaCare exchanges with federal taxpayers putting billions in to subsidize the expense of a few.",
  "WALLACE: Let me ask you a specific question on trade because the president may decide in the next few days whether or not to impose tough restrictions on steel imports coming into this country, talk about a possible 25 percent tariff.",
  "Ninety percent of the cost to be picked up by the feds for the expanded part of Medicaid, which, by the way, actually discriminates against, for example, Americans with disabilities because they only get 62 percent of federal funding.",
  "Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, author of the best-selling book, \"Understanding Trump.\"",
  "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALSYT: It’s an interesting formulation here, and you're hearing it from Congresswoman Edwards and for many others as well, which is that the president is out of step with the leaders in Europe.",
  "And what is really troubling about this, Chris, is this, that at the heart of these repeal and replace efforts is the -- is the reform of Medicaid, not to cut its spending, but to reduce the spiraling rate of growth of that program.",
  "We also heard from the Trump legal team that the person who took part in that meeting may have misrepresented herself and who she worked for and may, in fact, have had ties with DNC operatives, very interesting twist in that story.",
  "WALLACE (voice-over): In the wake of the G-20 Summit, we’ll discuss where things stand on Syria, Ukraine, Russian meddling in the last election, and the Trump agenda, when we sit down with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.",
  "WALLACE: At least 10 Republican senators have now said -- have come out formally -- you have not, although you’ve expressed doubts about it -- have expressed doubts about the McConnell plan as it was offered the last week in June.",
  "WALLACE: But what about Brit’s question, because that is one of the big concerns, and that President Obama and the Democrats expanded Medicaid, covered people that weren't previously covered, millions of people got it under there.",
  "And the fact of the matter is, I think he's placing America first, but with that, strategically aligning our allies and making sure that our objectives across the world and the objectives of western civilization are being met.",
  "However, what I can tell you is in my communication with our team on the subject, there was nothing to it, it was a 20 minute meeting, it ended after everyone was decidedly sitting there saying there's nothing happening here.",
  "So, Brit, Mitch McConnell didn't want his GOP colleagues to go home for this recess, concerned that spending a lot of time with their voters at home would only weaken support, not strengthen support, for repeal and replace.",
  "How concerned are folks when they read -- and obviously this fellow was aware of it, the CBO report that -- that tens of millions of people could lose their health insurance under the plans Republicans are putting forward?",
  "If they can create a relationship with the Russians understand that we would defend the three Baltic States and that they cannot threaten them, that’s an enormous -- I mean --\n\nWALLACE: Yes, there are a lot of ifs there.",
  "But there were a lot of times, and you just referred to it a couple times, sharp disagreement over climate change, just completely disagree and they kind of papered over the disagreement on trade, which still is there.",
  "So, when you go through a campaign, you’re not just talking to one particular group of people about in this case adoptions in Russia, you have policy teams talking about our place in Asia, talking about trade in China.",
  "It's a disagreement on the Paris agreement itself, and the fact that we don't want to be hamstrung by an agreement that’s going to hurt the American worker across the country that the president has pledged to support.",
  "So, my take on this is, when you talk about American leadership, you have to understand, we have the biggest economy in the world, we have the biggest military in the world, we can set an example for other countries.",
  "WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, you know, I want to ask about this controversy, and a lot of Democrats have been hitting Trump, a lot of your former colleagues in Congress, the idea of talking about moving forward.",
  "Well, again, same thing with NATO, we went out and said to NATO, pay your fair share, including Germany, by the way, all of a sudden, they are shocked that we want to actually have them help defend themselves.",
  "But, going forward, ObamaCare just cannot -- our American people want more freedom to make the decision that matters to them and not have somebody in Washington, D.C., tell them what that decision should be.",
  "And, quite frankly, I don't mean to be negative, but this is the reason it doesn't seem like Cassidy-Collins is going anywhere, is that if New York -- what you’re basically saying is it’s a federal system.",
  "It gives all the power to people who actually don't believe in President Trump’s campaign pledges, who actually don't want to continue to cover and care for pre-existing conditions and to lower premiums.",
  "It's way too early to judge, as the speaker suggests, but I can't help and think that it's probably worth a try, at least, to see if diplomatically some things -- constructive things can be accomplished.",
  "Medicaid has expanded dramatically in the zones it was never designed for and I think the American people would support reforms that had work requirements attached to people who were able-bodied adults.",
  "Second, I would say, look at what Mary Mayhew (ph) did in Maine where they passed reforms that said, if you’re an able-bodied adult, than you ought to be required to work if you have no children.",
  "GINGRICH: Well, they -- they did have a plan and I think what they've learned, painfully, is that the kind of plan you have when everybody assumes it will get vetoed gets one level of scrutiny.",
  "WALLACE: And one last question about the meeting, why would Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort all want to meet with a Russian lawyer about Russian adoption?",
  "However, you know, talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the American people, like adoption, is something that's not unusual.",
  "WALLACE: How do you respond to Democrats like Chuck Schumer who are saying it's disgraceful that the president comes out of this meeting and basically says, oh, we’re going to move forward?",
  "WALLACE: I want to turn to perhaps the highlight of the whole summit and that was the meeting, at least from the U.S. point of view, the meeting between President Trump and President Putin.",
  "VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I’m delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President, and I hope as you have said, our meeting will yield positive results.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia and the United States and for everybody concerned.",
  "Mitch McConnell is acknowledging that you may not pass repeal and replace, you may have to work with the Democrats to prop up ObamaCare, more Republican senators coming out against it.",
  "Secondly, are we serious about keeping Donald Trump’s campaign pledges to cover all, care for pre-existing conditions, eliminate the individual and employer mandate and lower premiums.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned, and it's an honor to be with you.",
  "If you’re serious about changing the Paris accord on economic grounds, which is what Trump said, if you read his speech, it's very clear that he thinks this is a bad deal for America.",
  "That all being said, let me just, because we might be running out of time, I want to make it very clear --\n\nWALLACE: We are running out --\n\nPRIEBUS: -- this was a positive meeting.",
  "That all being said, we need to move forward and actually maybe work with Russia on bringing peace to Syria and I think that's what you're seeing the beginning stages of happening.",
  "But once -- if -- if the president logs in that this is the plain he wishes, or that the leadership says, OK, this is the plan we want, then it will be the plan that goes forward.",
  "Later, the President tweeting on Sunday: Putin and I discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded.",
  "On the other hand, every time they come up with an iteration that becomes more conservative in the sense of giving power back to states, we move a little bit closer to passage.",
  "We don’t -- we disagree in regard to trade a little bit and the fact that this president actually believes that trade should be fair, that we shouldn't be taken advantage of.",
  "WALLACE: Let's talk about exactly that subject, because generally at these G-20 summits, the meetings of the world's leading economies, East and West, the U.S. sets the tone.",
  "And I think, in the end, what you’re going to find in the story, if you read the Circa column, because I think there’s more questions on the Democrat side than anywhere else.",
  "President Trump is back at the White House after the G-20 summit where he seemed to get along better with Russian President Putin than some of our long-time European allies.",
  "Congresswoman Edwards, President Trump, in that opening clip we played, may be overstating it, but you’ve got to agree that ObamaCare, as it currently stands, is in trouble.",
  "WALLACE: Juan, what do you think are the chances that Republicans fail to pass anything on repeal and replace, which I think there's a growing sentiment here in Washington.",
  "Now, that all being said --\n\nWALLACE: What happens when they impose -- what happens when they impose tough restrictions on our exports to them and then Americans lose jobs?",
  "If they think they can get along without the U.S. in the Paris accord, let's talk about six months from now because the truth is Angela Merkel and Germany ain't that big.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, host of the G-20 Summit, acknowledging there were some sharp differences between the U.S. and other countries.",
  "I don't know much about it other than it seems to be on the end of the Trump individuals a big nothing burger but may spin out of control for the DNC and the Democrats.",
  "WALLACE: And it was meaningful, I thought, that Mitch McConnell said, if we can't pass repeal and replace, we’re going to have to work with Democrats to try and fix it.",
  "Another deliverable, the announced agreement with China to conduct joint military exercises in 2018, Beijing’s obvious attempt to mollify U.S. concerns over the North.",
  "We should go back to conservative principles where we devolve power to the states and to the patients allowing them to make the patients -- the best decision for them.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But I’ll tell you what’s rude, taking 22 million people off their health care in this country who you know who cannot afford it.",
  "Look, the president starts from a simple premise, we have a whole series of agreements that are bad for America, while they are good for the guys that got the deals.",
  "He basically says he's going to impose limits on steel and you get the head of the European Commission saying, god, we’ll then impose limits on some of your exports.",

  "I do think we have to do something for market stabilization, otherwise people who are paying premiums of $20,000 $30,000 and $40,000 will pay even that much more.",
  "EDWARDS: Well, I also think that, you know, first of all, the rate of increase is not the rate of increase that we would have seen had we done nothing at all.",
  "This as FOX News confirms that Donald Trump, Jr., arranged a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer with connections to the Kremlin.",

  "It may be that at some point, you say, hey, we are taking more aggressive steps that are being imposed on other countries, so that's not fair to us.",

  "And I think that one of the perceptions coming out of the G-20 is that the United States doesn't seem to be standing in its leadership position.",
  "WALLACE: But I guess what I'm asking is, if you look at a rewritten -- and I understand you haven't seen it all -- but what you've heard about.",
  "So if we continue in that pathway, I do think we come up with both a bill that passes and one that fulfills President Trump’s campaign pledges.",
