  "Yury Martyanov/AP\n\nThe Russian lawyer who catapulted into the spotlight when it emerged that she met with Donald Trump Jr. and top members of the Trump campaign last year after promising them dirt on Hillary Clinton, has been described as a Russian \"patriot\" and has expressed some controversial views, according to The Atlantic.",
  "When former acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered the Department of Justice not to defend President Donald Trump's initial executive order instating the travel ban, Veselnitskaya wrote on Facebook, \"I can't think of a single norm that would allow the attorney general to do something like this.\"",
  "Veselnitskaya is said to be a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and she is also known for waging a harsh campaign against the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which blacklisted Russians suspected of human-rights abuse.",
  "Natalia Veselnitskaya met with Trump Jr. and members of the Trump campaign as part of \"Russia and its government's support\" for Trump's candidacy, according to an email thread Trump Jr. posted on Twitter earlier this week.",
  "Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016, is best known in the US for defending a Russian businessman accused by the US government of laundering millions.",
  "In a separate post, The Atlantic reported, she referred to the women's marches against Trump as \"a p---y strike ... all orchestrated by [Senate minority leader Chuck] Schumer.\"",
  "She slammed many of the protests against President Donald Trump, including the Women's March in Washington that took place the day after Trump assumed office.",
  "According to Veselnitskaya's Facebook posts examined by The Atlantic, she has frequently supported Trump's actions and bashed his critics on social media.",
  "In particular, she pushed the far-right conspiracy theory that the march was organized by Hamas and said that \"liberalism is a f--king mental disorder.\"",
  "Putin, who cut off a program allowing Americans to adopt Russian children in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, previously called the law \"outrageous.\"",
  "In another post, Veselnitskaya called the American media immature and said journalists failed to understand \"what happens in masses.\"",
  "\"'My body, my choice' is all about abortion, homosexuality, illegal migration and two presidents,\" she said on Facebook.",
  "But for those who didn't get what this is about, this is now called 'human rights.'\"",
  "She has also played off of Trump's frequent criticisms of the free press.",
  "This is reminiscent of the games of Obama's last days in office.\"",
  "She continued, \"In such instances the general has to resign.",
  "She also blasted pro-choice ideals.",
  "\"Anything goes."
