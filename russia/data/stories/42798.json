  "The number of Facebook users affected by the recent data sharing scandal could exceed 87 million and records could be stored in Russia, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie said on Sunday.",
  "An organization run by Kogan, called Global Science Research (GSR), shared the data with controversial political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica without their permission.",
  "\"I couldn't tell you how many people had access to it, that's a question better answered by Cambridge Analytica, but I can say that various people had access to it.\"",
  "Wylie said that Aleksandr Kogan, whose quiz app harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users, could have allowed that data to be stored in Russia.",
  "Wylie believes the total number of Facebook users whose data was shared could be even more than the 87 million admitted by Facebook last week.",
  "CNBC also contacted Kogan's Cambridge University email address, but the academic was not available at the time of publication.",
  "Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.",
  "Cambridge Analytica has said that it licensed no more than 30 million Facebook users from GSR.",
  "Initial reports by the Observer and New York Times newspapers put the figure at 50 million.",
