  "With him died the old legend of the Young Reformers, of the leaders of the Bolotnaya [Square] protests and so on.”\n\nAfter military parades marking the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, Putin gravely told Russian TV’s Channel One he had considered authorizing the use of tactical nukes in the peninsula against “the NATO threat.” On the same day, leading journalist and opposition activist Ksenia Sobchak announced she was thinking of leaving Russia after she learned her name was on a Chechen hit list of liberal “traitors.”\n\n“It would be in some way less worrying if Putin had ordered Nemtsov's killing,” blogged Sobchak, who has known Putin since childhood because her father was the first mayor of post-Soviet Leningrad—and Putin’s boss and patron.",
  "Following Dadayev’s arrest, Kadyrov—using Instagram, his favored means of sharing pictures of himself in his private zoo and communicating his political views to the outside world—called the suspect \"a true Russian patriot.” He also suggested that Dadayev had been offended by Nemtsov’s support of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists murdered by Islamist gunmen in Paris.",
  "Today, the same streets are filled with patriotic crowds waving banners saying, “Crimea is ours—Obama don’t envy us,” “America, keep your hands off” and “I am proud of my country.” (Photos later surfaced on Russian social media of queues of these patriots, hiding their faces from the camera and apparently lining up to be paid for their attendance.)",
  "Killing somebody this prominent, and certainly doing the deed blocks from Red Square, was against the rules.”\n\nSergey Bobylev/Kommersant/Getty Whitmore and many leading Kremlin watchers see the Nemtsov assassination as part of an unfolding war among Russia's siloviki—the military, police and KGB men who control the security services.",
  "“The Russian president can neither punish nor remove him, because Chechnya is so difficult to control.”\n\nThe deeper problem is that Putin has created a system in which he has “monopolized not only the decision-making process in Russia but also the very ability to make decisions,” says Putin biographer and critic Masha Gessen.",
  "After evidence leaked in a Moscow newspaper indicating Dadayev had been surveilling Nemtsov’s apartment long before the Paris attacks, Kadyrov began saying his lieutenant was innocent and accused the Russian media of concocting a “conspiracy” to undermine both Dadayev and himself.",
  "Politkovskaya was murdered outside her Moscow apartment in 2006, shortly after calling Kadyrov the “Stalin of our times.” Estemirova was kidnapped and shot in Grozny in 2009 after writing about Kadyrov’s alleged involvement in torture and extrajudicial executions, which he denied.",
  "There is no one controlling the process any more—there is chaotic hatred that is fueled every day by the federal mass media.”\n\nThe more disturbing story behind Nemtsov’s murder is that the Kremlin has opened a Pandora’s box of paranoia and violence that it can no longer control.",
  "When you have people running around the streets of Moscow choosing who lives and who dies—that’s not OK.” According to the newspaperman, who until his recent retirement attended regular meetings with Putin and his top lieutenants, “this was a kind of ‘screw you!’ to Putin.",
  "A ‘Screw You!’ to Putin\n\nDadayev—who confessed but later withdrew his statement, claiming he was tortured—served as the deputy commander of an Interior Ministry paramilitary unit known as Battalion Sever, which has long been the Chechen leader’s Praetorian Guard.",
  "Even if the Kremlin leader agrees that Nemtsov was a traitor, “that doesn’t necessarily make it OK to murder him,” says the long-serving editor-in-chief of one of Russia’s most prominent newspapers, who asked for anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.",
  "But we get to execute them how we like.”\n\nGoing Rogue\n\nIn a political system like Russia's, where Putin has replaced formal institutions with what his supporters call “personal control,” the unwritten rules of court politics are paramount.",
  "Nemtsov was one of the leaders of demonstrations in Moscow against the annexation of Crimea—and came under fire from Russian nationalists for appealing to the United States and the European Union to tighten sanctions against the Kremlin.",
  "This year, Kadyrov has been a prominent organizer of the Russia-wide “anti-Maidan” movement, the goal of which is to block the kind of anti-regime protests that toppled a corrupt, pro-Russian government in Kiev, Ukraine, last year.",
  "“What we are seeing now is the death throes of the old liberal opposition,” says blogger Anton Krasovsky, who worked as chief of staff for oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov’s unsuccessful presidential campaign against Putin in 2012.",
  "Putin even bestowed a valor medal on the Chechen strongman for pacifying his rebellious province a few days after the Nemtsov assassination—before the extent of the links between the Chechen suspects and Kadyrov emerged.",
  "When the Russian leader disappeared from public view for 10 days early in March, the country’s political class grew nervous and the blogosphere traded stories about coups, strokes and even Putin’s alleged love child.",
  "Nemtsov wouldn’t be the first Kadyrov critic to wind up dead—investigative reporters Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova were shot and killed while working on stories about corruption and violence in Chechnya.",
  "The rest of the country didn’t seem to notice Putin's absence—despite a series of comic mix-ups on state-controlled TV when prerecorded video of the president's supposedly busy schedule aired in the wrong order.",
  "Nemtsov’s killing may come to be seen as a turning point—not only as the day when the liberal opposition lost a leader but also as the day the ultranationalist death squads first took to the streets of Moscow.",
  "Just three winters ago, liberal, middle-class supporters of departing president Dmitry Medvedev filled Moscow and St. Petersburg, demanding fair elections and more political liberty and free speech.",
  "Regardless of who actually ordered Nemtsov's death, Kadyrov's detractors in the security services now appear to be using the killing against him by leaking damaging details to the press.",
  "The mastermind of the operation, according to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, was Zaur Dadayev—a man with close ties to a Chechen rebel-turned Putin loyalist, Ramzan Kadyrov.",
  "Russian state-controlled TV portrayed Nemtsov and his fellow opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, as American-funded stooges—and Putin spoke of a “fifth column” of enemies inside Russia.",
  "But Putin’s brief disappearance offers a glimpse into just how dependent on him the Russian state has become—and suggests that chaos is likely to be Putin’s principal successor.",
  "In 2011, when Nemtsov and hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Moscow, protesting Putin’s return to power, Kadyrov called for the opposition leader to be imprisoned.",
  "The simplest explanation—and the one that most leaders of Russia’s liberal opposition believe—is that the Kremlin killed Nemtsov to intimidate them into silence.",
  "But Kadyrov has also acquired dangerous enemies, from FSB chief Aleksandr Bortnikov to top Kremlin courtiers, including Putin’s chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.",
  "Five suspects have been apprehended, all of them from Chechnya (a sixth blew himself up with a grenade rather than be taken alive, police say).",
  "He commands thousands of armed loyalists, and he described Putin as “a father” to him after the assassination of his own father in 2004.",
  "On a drizzly Moscow night, a gunman follows Boris Nemtsov, a prominent political critic, and his girlfriend across a lonely bridge.",
  "“Kadyrov has put Putin in a hopeless situation,” says former parliamentarian and liberal opposition politician Konstantin Borovoi.",
  "No matter who ordered Nemtsov’s murder, there’s little doubt that Kadyrov considered him a traitor to Russia and a personal enemy.",
  "“Putin must be held responsible for the murder of Boris,” says former world chess champion and opposition leader Garry Kasparov.",
  "And the evidence is mounting that Nemtsov was shot by a security services-connected death squad let loose in Russia’s capital.",
  "“Signals and gestures matter,” says Brian Whitmore, author of The Power Vertical, an influential blog for Kremlinologists.",
  "No Hollywood director could have framed the grim scene better—or freighted it with more symbolism.",
  "And who was the message intended for—Russia’s beleaguered opposition or President Vladimir Putin?",
  "As the victim lies bleeding, the domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin tower behind him.",
  "But it would be a shocking shift if they’re in fact killing their enemies in the street.",
  "If Kadyrov, for instance, has indeed gone rogue, there’s little Putin can do about it.",
  "The more pressing question, though, is whether Putin is still able to control Kadyrov.",
  "But there is a Putin who has built a hellish Terminator and he has lost control of it.",
  "As Sobchak puts it, the rounds that killed Nemtsov “are only the first six bullets.",
  "It would be scary enough if the assassins were working at Putin’s command.",
  "“It would be an awful system, but at least a system, a manageable system.",
  "‘A Pandora’s Box of Paranoia and Violence’\n\nIt wasn’t always the case.",
  "“They have to, because the law doesn't apply to those on the top….",
  "“Kadyrov is a very psychologically sick man,” Nemtsov responded.",
  "It’s not surprising that Putin’s lieutenants are at loggerheads.",
  "“Boris’s death was a kind of symbolic parting with the past.",
  "[The killers] were saying, Sure, boss, you make the rules.",
  "I don't care.”\n\nBut it does matter who ordered the hit.",
  "The message is clear: So die all enemies of the regime.",
  "Kadyrov is among the most powerful men in Russia.",
  "But it’s even more frightening if they were not.",
  "There is no Putin who gave a command to kill.",
  "For years, the admiration was mutual.",
  "“The Kremlin was in shock, of course.",
  "There are troubled times ahead.”",
  "But this is not the case.",
  "But who sent the message?",
  "Six shots are fired.",
  "“Who ordered it?"
