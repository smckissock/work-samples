  "Mercury partner Michael McKeon said the firm is working with DOJ to finalize its own filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, “which will be completed in a timely fashion.”\n\nLobbying firms typically prefer the congressional disclosures, known as the Lobbying Disclosure Act, wherever possible because they are less detailed and burdensome than reporting to the Justice Department under FARA, which requires disclosure of work for foreign governments or political parties.",
  "Therefore, today the Podesta Group has reclassified its previous LDA registration for the Centre to a FARA registration.”\n\nWhile violating FARA is a criminal offense, the Justice Department typically seeks to resolve problems by bringing lobbyists into compliance rather than bringing charges.",
  "Lobbying powerhouse the Podesta Group filed paperwork with the Justice Department today acknowledging that its work years ago for a European nonprofit benefited the same Ukrainian political party once advised by Paul Manafort, who later ran Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.",
  "But the new paperwork suggests the Justice Department has information tying the think tank to the pro-Russian Ukrainian Party of Regions — a possible source of continuing legal trouble for Manafort, because he never disclosed his own role in the lobbying campaign.",
  "“However, we also understand after constructive consultation with FARA Unit staff that their position, which is based on all the information available to them, is that the overall representation is better classified as a FARA registration.",
  "Last November, the Podesta Group updated its disclosures about lobbying work for India after contacts between its chairman, Tony Podesta, and his brother, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, surfaced in the latter’s hacked emails.",
  "Podesta Group CEO Kimberly Fritts said in a statement that the firm relied on assurances from the think tank, the European Centre for Modern Ukraine, that it was not controlled or financed by a foreign government or political party.",
  "At the time, The Associated Press reported that Manafort, working for pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych, secretly supervised the lobbying campaign funneled through a Brussels think tank.",
  "More recently, Michael Flynn, Trump’s short-lived national security adviser, retroactively disclosed lobbying that benefited the government of Turkey after initially filing under the LDA instead of FARA.",
  "While the new paperwork appears to settle the controversy as far as the Podesta Group is concerned, it suggests the FARA discrepancy remains an open front in the legal problems hounding Manafort.",
  "“The work in question was widely known, concluded before Mr. Manafort began working with the Trump campaign and was not conducted on behalf of the Russian government,” Maloni said.",

  "Manafort has been in discussions with federal authorities about disclosing his overseas political work since before the 2016 election, Maloni said.",
  "The AP obtained emails showing that Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, directed the work of the Podesta Group and another lobbying firm, Mercury.",
  "Manafort also faces suspicions of taking off-the-books payments for his work in Ukraine, promoting Russia across Europe, and laundering money.",
