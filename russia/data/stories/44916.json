  "Graham continued: “Do you agree with me that you better come up with different ways because this ain’t working.”\n\n“In certain areas that is true, like in other areas like the core part of what we do\" Zuckerberg said, then pivotted his answer back to his key message about how users have control of what they post and who can see it: \"At the most basic level people come to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger about 100-billion times a day to share a piece of content or a message with a specific set of people and I think that basic functionality people understand because we have the controls inline very time.”\n\nBut Senator Dick Durbin showed up Facebook’s hypocrisy about privacy, asking Zuckerberg: “Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?\"",
  "You want to give people control in the product itself.”\n\nAsked by Graham if Facebook was a monopoly, he answered, improbably: “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me.”\n\nBut Graham continued, on a theme that has been repeated frequently in the two weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal was broken by The Observer newspaper: “Why should we let you self-regulate?”\n\nZuckerberg’s response, although trying to minimize the damage was accurate: “I think the real question is, what is the right regulation?”\n\nZuckerberg won’t have disappointed the political heavyweights who trained him to handle these tough questions.",
  "Durbin said he was trying to demonstrate how this was about “your right to privacy, the limits to your right to privacy, and how much you would give away in modern America in the name of connecting people around the world” He added this was about “what information Facebook has collected, who they’re sending it to, and if they were asked in advance my permission to do that”.",
  "Zuckerberg’s opening statement is a classic instance of the founder mythology that Facebook loves to talk about: how this clever young guy came up with a smart way to communicate with other people and became fabulously wealthy along the way while transforming the world.",
  "I have no assurance that these kinds of vague commitments are going to produce actions.”\n\nSenator John Thune, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, pointed out that each time Facebook encounters a problem it apologizes and promises an improvement.",
  "“After more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today’s apology different and why should we trust Facebook to make the necessary changes to ensure user privacy and give people a clearer picture of your privacy policies?” Thune said.",
  "Watching Zuckerberg testify in a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees about Cambridge Analytica and all the other privacy scandal affecting the 2.2-billion-strong social network is an edifying experience.",
  "He may have appealed to the Silicon Valley founder myth repeatedly but it belies the fact that the 34-year-old has been the chief executive of the largest social network, and eight largest company in the world, for 14 years.",
  "Mark Zuckerberg likes to project himself as the all-conquering Silicon Valley entrepreneur, a smart young man whose tech-savvy skills have allowed him to build the Facebook “community” whose main aim is “connecting people”.",
  "Perhaps its because he's defending the indefensible, as we know from numerous scandals that have erupted over how Facebook exploit its own users to help mine their personal preferences to better target advertising.",
  "Durbin continued: “If you messaged anyone this week, would you share with us the names of people you messaged?”\n\n“Senator, No I would probably not choose to do that publically here,” Zuckerberg replied.",
  "The best summation of how complex and unintelligible Facebook’s terms and conditions are, was when Senator Graham held up a thick wad of paper that is a print out of Facebook’s terms of service.",
  "But this appeal to dorm-room entrepreneurship is getting tired, which could be seen from lawmakers, who asked pointed questions about why he's still apologising and not fixing the problems.",
  "Do you think the average consumer understands what they are signing up for?”\n\nZuckerberg was forced to respond: “I don’t think the average person likely reads that whole document”.",
  "But the sense remains that Facebook isn’t telling everything it knows, nor isn't willing to admit its business model is heavily in favor of the company and not the users.",
  "Repeating previous comments he has made, especially last week, he said: \"It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.",
  "He repeatedly stressed how much control his users had over what they post, but failed to answer pointed questions about what data Facebook collects and how it uses it.",
  "Dressed uncharacteristically in a dark blue suit and bright blue tie, he looked like a frightened student trying to explain his way out of cheating on an exam.",
  "You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical violation to report this violation of the FTC consent decree,” Senator Richard Blumenthal told him.",
  "“My reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road.",
  "\"It's pretty much impossible to start a company in your dorm room and grow it to the scale we are at now without making some mistakes,\" he said.",
  "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy\".",
  "Having been coached beforehand, he has tried to avoid incriminating himself while appearing contrite and cooperative.",
  "He read out an inscrutable legalese phrase, then said: “I'm a lawyer and I have no idea of what that means.",
  "Looking pale and nervous, he lacks the usual self-confidence that he has triumphed as a tech entrepreneur.",
  "\"I would say we are going through a broader philosophical shift in how we run the company.\"",
  "\"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake.",
  "As his nervous demeanor suggests, Zuckerberg still has a lot to be worried about.",
  "Is that, he probed Zuckerberg, a fair thing for a user of Facebook to expect?",
  "He certainly doesn't look like the world-beater he normally does.",
  "After a pause, and to instant laughter, he replied: “no”.",
  "Your business model is to maximize profit over privacy.",
  "I run it and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"",
  "To say Zuckerberg is squirming is an understatement.",
  "“Yes,’ he sheepishly replied, “it is a fair thing.",
  "“We’ve seen the apology tours before.",
  "On Tuesday, he was anything but.",
  "It was a big mistake.",
  "I started Facebook.",
  "And I'm sorry."
