  "Matthew Wyman, a contemporary Russian politics specialist at Keele University, told CNBC that the games were important to Russian President Vladimir Putin because Russia wants to \"carry on projecting this image to the outside world of a resurgent Russia and national strength.\"",
  "\"The country's ability to defend itself in the current international situation, which is often aggressive and unfriendly towards our country, means (it) is justified,\" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.",
  "When asked by reporters if the cost of holding the exercises was justified at a time when Russia is faced with higher social spending demands, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the war games were essential.",

  "Russia experts said Russia was keen to maintain an image of military strength to the rest of the world, despite the cost.",
  "\"Just like when Putin reinstituted the (military) parade through Red Square, this is just very high-cost posturing.\"",
  "As a matter of practical economics, the Kremlin can't afford to send the tanks rolling in,\" he said.",
  "The exercises come at a tense time for Russia's relations with the rest of the world.",
  "As such, its large-scale military exercises often cause consternation in the West.",
  "Russia is secretive about the cost of its massive military exercises, however.",
  "It's military role in Syria has also caused rifts with the West."
