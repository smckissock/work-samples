  "Elliot Harmon of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) put it succinctly: “without fair use protections, people and companies in the public eye could use copyright law to ban coverage that’s critical of them.”\n\nHere comes the perverted part: Political operatives and in some cases news organizations themselves have ignored the Fair Use doctrine and improperly use the DMCA to remove from the internet their opponents’ political advertising or commentary containing excerpts of press conferences, debates and interviews made by the complaining party.",
  "Similarly, “Brave New Films” — a far left outfit that raised $2,020,866 in donations from George Soros, Barbra Streisand’s charitable foundation and others — was forced to go to federal court to decide the merits of using clips of archconservative Michael Savage, after Savage’s distribution company filed a DMCA to take down clips featuring Savage, used to criticize and challenge his political positions.",
  "Every attempt to filter or verify “fake news” has been botched: from hiring millennial social justice warrior “news curators” with no journalism experience, to relying upon slanderous, irresponsible outfits such as the Southern Poverty Law Center as arbiters of truth, we can be sure that the tech giants responsible for distribution of information will be unable to solve an admittedly complex problem.",
  "CBS is not the only news organization using the DMCA to protect its alleged “reputation” for neutrality: Fox News also filed a DMCA to delete from YouTube a McCain advertisement containing a seven second audio clip of the voice of Fox News correspondent Major Garrett from a Special Report broadcast in which Garrett noted Obama’s refusal to take a stance on the bailout of insurance giant AIG.",
  "The best part is that before he felt qualified to sit in that distinguished chair, he was clobbered by the Federal Trade Commission for…wait for it, wait for it…operating a “revenge porn website” scheme called “IsAnybodyDown?” That site allowed people to upload nude photographs of others (without permission) and encouraged that personal information be uploaded as well.",
  "This law aligns with the motive force behind Thomas Jefferson’s authorship of the original American copyright laws: “to promote the progress of science and useful arts” we create a carrot and stick scheme where artists are encouraged to produce new work (good for society) and are rewarded with a limited monopoly to reap the fruits of that labor (good for creators).",
  "Last week’s news cycle was dominated by allegations and speculation regarding the “manipulation” of voter’s minds through shady data collection by both Cambridge Analytica (allegedly supporting Trump) and by Facebook and Google (allegedly supporting Secretary Clinton and previously President Obama).",
  "Similarly, but a bit more complicated, for all the pearl-clutching about “scandalous” data mining, I don’t care if a candidate knows that I collect Jaguar cars, use All-Clad pans, read one columnist more frequently than another columnist or hold one set of political beliefs over another.",
  "Specifically, candidates, political parties and their operatives – with the support of news organizations – have been abusing copyright law not to “manipulate” voter’s thoughts, but much more dangerously deny them the opportunity to hear candidates in their own words at all.",

  "I have serious doubts about the veracity about “mind control” conspiracies favored by the progressive left that assumes Americans are not autonomous actors or are in fact stupid, gullible hicks who simply can’t be trusted to think for themselves.",
  "(The law also has a “counter-notice” provision that allows the alleged infringer to argue that they have the right to use the excerpt, and if the creator wants to remove the work permanently, they are required to hash it out in federal court).",
  "He is the author of “The International Libel and Privacy Handbook”, teaches media ethics and law at New York University and also lectures globally and writes frequently about media and free speech issues for Instapundit and other outlets.",
  "The panic about data-mining is driven largely by the paternalistic, if not authoritarian view that “only the right people” should determine what is read and heard, because after all, those “bitter clingers” are too stupid to have a voice.",
  "CBS’s basis for filing a takedown was that they objected to the “use of CBS personnel in political advertising.” Putting aside any discussion of CBS’ bias against McCain, the protection of CBS’s “image” is not a valid basis for a DMCA.",
  "The ad, criticizing Obama for his remark on the campaign trail, concluded with an approximately seven-second clip of previous comments by the perky-but-serious Couric about sexism faced by then-Senator Hillary Clinton’s campaign.",
  "Federal law says that while these outfits cannot be held liable for hosting infringing works uploaded by a third-party, this immunity disappears if the ISP does not quickly remove the infringing work once they get a DMCA letter.",
  "The very same website also advertised content removal services under the name “Takedown Hammer” and “Takedown Lawyer” that would delete consumers’ images and content from the site in exchange for a payment of $200 to $500.",
  "The same Craig Britain, who has been filing bogus DMCA’s to protect his “privacy.” (I’m quite sure the fact that the interviews that allowed voters to hear his own embarrassing words is purely coincidental).",
  "Proving my pet theory that hypocrisy is a job requirement for any politician, Arizona’s Craig Brittain is running as a Republican to replace Senator Jeff Flake in that states August primaries.",
  "In short, it allows writers, artists, filmmakers and other content creators to file a simple demand for removal to an Internet Service Provider who hosts copies of infringing works.",
  "The Digital Millennium Copyright Act: Weaponizing a good law\n\nSigned into law in 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has a pretty good purpose at its core.",
  "The Fair Use doctrine is not only embedded in the statute itself, but has been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as an important element in free speech rights.",
  "In one anecdote, the 2008 McCain campaign used a short clip of CBS News anchor Katie Couric in a 2008 ad based on Barack Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” comment.",
  "In short, we should be less concerned with attempts to tell you what to think than your ability to hear candidates’ own words to make up your own mind.",
