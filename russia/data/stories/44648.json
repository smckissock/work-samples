  "After days without comment by Facebook's top executives on public revelations that Cambridge Analytica collected the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, the social network's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally spoken out about the privacy crisis.",
  "Zuckerberg confirmed that in 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz that was installed by about 300,000 people who shared their data and some of their friends' data, giving Kogan access to the data of tens of millions of Facebook users.",
  "Zuckerberg, who is expected to complete a CNN interview airing Wednesday evening, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that he claims responsibility for protecting users' data and has been working to understand what happened to ensure a similar leak doesn't happen again.",
  "The company will remove developers' access to data if users haven't used the app in three months, and will limit the data users give developers when they log in to include only their name, profile photo and email address.",
  "To make it easier for Facebook users to control their information, Facebook will add a new tool to the top of news feed showing people which apps can access their data, including a feature to revoke the app's access.",
  "Facebook then banned Kogan from the platform and demanded that he and Cambridge Analytica \"formally certify\" that they had deleted the data, and both parties \"provided these certifications,\" Zuckerberg said.",
  "(The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebook's handling of user data, and the European Commission is asking data protection authorities to investigate the data leak.)",
  "In 2015, Facebook learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had violated Facebook's policies by sharing the social network data with data-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica.",
  "If Facebook finds that developers missed any personal information, Facebook will ban the app creators and alert all users affect by the apps, including users affected by Kogan's leak.",
  "In 2014, Zuckerberg said Facebook changed its policies to stop allowing app creators to access data about a person's friends unless the user's friends had also authorized the app.",
  "Moving forward, Zuckerberg said Facebook will investigate all apps that had access to \"large amounts of information\" before the social network changed its data policies in 2014.",
  "He confirmed that last week, Facebook learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica \"may not\" have deleted the data as it had claimed.",
  "On Wednesday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg also addressed the Cambridge Analytica controversy for the first time, echoing Zuckerberg's comments that the social network.",
  "\"As he said, we know that this was a major violation of people's trust, and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it,\" Sandberg said in a Facebook post.",
  "Developers will need to get approval from users and sign a contract with Facebook in order to ask any users for access to their posts or private data.",
  "While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past.\"",
  "(This feature is currently available in users' privacy settings, however the new placement will make it easier for people to find from news feed.)",
  "He also outlined steps Facebook has taken to address the data leak and the company's plans to prevent the abuse of users' privacy moving forward.",
  "\"We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward,\" he added.",
  "Facebook then banned Cambridge Analytica from using any of its services and hired a firm to complete a forensic audit of the firm.",
  "\"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.",
  "Facebook said it will audit of any app \"with suspicious activity\" and ban any developers that do not agree to being reviewed.",
  "\"But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.",
  "\"This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,\" Zuckerberg said in Wednesday post.",
  "Zuckerberg said the company plans to announce more data policy changes over the coming days.",
  "Zuckerberg said the company is \"working with regulators to investigate what happened.\"",
  "Facebook said it will also further restrict developers' access to data more broadly.",
  "Cambridge Analytica helped run President Donald Trump's political campaign.",
  "\"I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community.",
  "We need to fix that.\""
