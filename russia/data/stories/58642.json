  "It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2018\n\nBefore entering the White House, Trump tended to be more direct with his insults, as former Fox News host Megyn Kelly noted during the first Republican primary debate .",
  "(CNN) President Donald Trump has long used Twitter to define -- and defame -- his political opponents, but about 20 months into his presidency it's become blindingly clear that his use of social media to target critics, disloyal former lieutenants and the media tells us more about him than anyone else.",
  "\"While I know it's 'not presidential' to take on a lowlife like Omarosa,\" he tweeted on August 13 , \"and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible.",
  "Attacks on a pair of female figures, both with connections to men Trump has sought to discredit in relation to the Russia probe, have also brought attention to the way he addresses women -- thinly cloaking his obvious contempt with loaded allusions to their appearances.",
  "By Trump's definition, whether it's the NFL or the investigations, and investigators, into Russian election interference, what \"lifts\" him tends to be synonymous with what lays others low -- especially if it's by his own hand, or tweeting digit(s).",
  "More recently, he went after a pair of black men who have been critical, NBA star LeBron James and CNN anchor Don Lemon, saying that Lemon -- whom he called \"the dumbest man on television\" -- made James \"look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"",
  "Nor does it include the estimated 200 NFL players -- almost all of them black -- who have knelt or in some other way protested racial inequality and police brutality during the National Anthem and been assailed by the President for it.",
  "In June 2017, Trump singled out then 50-year-old Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" in a tweet disparaging her appearance and intellect:\n\nI heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore).",
  "The first such tweet came on August 1 and the second on August 11, the same day the President described Nellie Ohr, a former Fusion GPS contractor married to career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, as his \"beautiful wife.\"",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018\n\nThe big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly.",
  "Trump's attacks took a particularly dehumanizing turn in late August, when he called former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, the only African-American to serve in a senior role in his White House , a \"dog.\"",
  "The President has twice described former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged critical texts about Trump during the 2016 campaign with the since-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, as \"the lovely Lisa Page.\"",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017\n\nTrump has also used the \"low IQ\" insult against actor Robert De Niro and, a few weeks later, Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is black.",
  "During his time on the job, the President has singled out on Twitter at least two corporate CEOs: Ken Frazier of the pharmaceutical giant Merck, who is black, and Disney's Bob Iger, who is white.",
  ".....Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired?",
  "As an example, while Trump is fond of saying this or that person behaved in some way \"like a dog,\" since becoming President he has referred to only one person as a dog: Manigault Newman.",
  "Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017\n\n...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me.",
  "As he told Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, according to a deposition given by Jones and reported by the Wall Street Journal , \"This is a very winning, strong issue for me.\"",
  "Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has directly insulted, attacked or otherwise maligned more than 100 individuals, according to our unscientific review of his feed.",
  "The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2018\n\nRussian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX.",
  "Trump has repeatedly attacked the protesters, accusing them, as he did in an October 2017 tweet, of \"showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.\"",
  "But that doesn't account for the three UCLA basketball players he criticized as not sufficiently grateful -- \"I should have left them in jail!\"",
  "Of the 24 women he has gone after specifically, 17 are white and 12 were over 50 years of age at the time, according to our count.",
  "\"Tell everybody,\" the President said, in an apparent reference to other owners and league officials, \"you can't win this one.",
  "On Tuesday, he went back to the same fetid well to describe adult film actress Stormy Daniels in a tweet as \"Horseface.\"",
  "(Trump called Arianna Huffington \"a dog who wrongfully comments on me\" a few months before beginning his 2016 campaign.)",
  "Special counsel Robert Mueller, either directly or in reference to his team, has been named in around 43 tweets.",
  "And that doesn't account for his broadsides against the FBI and other institutions in and outside of government.",
  "But his attacks on older women (by our arbitrary definition) and those of color have been memorably visceral.",
  "@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas.",
  "You can decide where his \"Horseface\" insult -- directed against a woman -- fits on the spectrum.",
  "he tweeted -- for his intervention following their arrest for shoplifting in China last year.",
  "As an example, of the roughly 82 men he's tweeted negatively about by name, 69 are white.",
  "So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!",
  "(Hat tip to this New York Times compendium, which traces back to before his candidacy.)",
  "Trump has used the phrase \"Crooked Hillary\" more than 60 times since taking office.",
  "By comparison, \"Fake News\" clocks in with 275 appearances and \"Witch Hunt\" at 127.",
  "No individual, however, has popped up more in Trump's feed than Hillary Clinton.",
  "But the calculation plainly ran deeper than his stated reasoning.",
  "\"Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials lawsuit versus Trump.",
  "Perhaps this is, after all, his version of \"presidential.\"",
  "(A second hat tip here to the Trump Twitter Archive .)",
  "And this count began after the 2016 election.",
  "She was bleeding badly from a face-lift.",
  "She knows nothing about me, a total con!",
  "She will confirm the letter she signed!",
  "Trump is entitled to full legal fees.\"",
  "The numbers can only tell us so much.",
  "This story has been updated.",
  "More than a dozen are not.",
  "Then how come low I.Q.",
  "This one lifts me.\"",
  "Disgraceful!",
  "I said no!",
  "Or not.",
  "Sorry!\""
