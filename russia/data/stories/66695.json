  "“After five tremendously rewarding years working as Communications Advisor to America’s Senator, the great Jeff Sessions of Alabama, I want to let you know I have accepted a position with Laura Ingraham’s LifeZette, where on Monday I will begin as Senior Editor,” Garrett Murch said in an email.",
  "A key member of Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions’ staff announced his departure Wednesday to join the news website LifeZette, a move that seems to signal Sessions will not be chosen as Donald Trump’s running mate.",
  "If Murch thought Sessions would be chosen, it seems likely he would have waited a week for Trump to announce before leaving the office.",
  "Trump has named Sessions as a possible running mate, and Sessions himself has said he would be open to taking the position.",
  "One former member of Sessions’ staff, Stephen Miller, is now a senior policy adviser for Trump.",
  "With Murch leaving, it doesn’t seem Sessions will be picked as the vice presidential nominee."
