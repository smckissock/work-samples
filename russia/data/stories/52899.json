  "Wanted a bit more of a win – but it is a win!”\n\nPolitico Magazine has described Merrill as the “affable” traveling press secretary who joined “Clinton world” as a “lowly advance staffer.” In 2014, Maggie Haberman, who worked for Politico at the time and now reports for the NYT, placed him on her “Hillary Clinton’s 50 Influentials” list.",
  "Date: February 2, 2016\n\nMerrill was writing to Capricia Marshall, a longtime Clinton friend and State Department insider who was Chief of Protocol of the United States from 2009 to 2013.",
  "The article that Merrill is referencing is this one in which Chozick reported that Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook was on the outs after a bad showing in Iowa.",
  "What does Hillary Clinton‘s traveling press secretary Nick Merrill really think of the New York Times reporting covering his boss’s campaign?",
  "She’s “an idiot.”\n\nAnd the she in this scenario would be Amy Chozick, who has written extensively about Clinton.",
  "But that’s not where peoples’ heads are.”\n\nCapricia replied, “We’re [sic] people saying Robbie needs to go?",
  "She replied, “I’ve been called worse.”\n\nUPDATE: Some further context here.",
  "Marshall also worked on Clinton’s New York Senate campaign.",
  "The news emerged in the latest DCLeaks Clinton email dump.",
  "There wouldn’t have even been time for folks to say that!",
  "Haberman called him Clinton’s “genial” press aide.",
  "The comment was revealed in the latest email dump.",
  "Just read in Amy piece – ground was so awesome!",
  "The Mirror asked Chozick for reaction.",
  "Felt badly for her.",
  "What you hearing?",
  "He was number 27.",
  "Subject: Really?",
