  "The agency will now be forced to spend resources to eliminate duplication (over the years, the FSB developed its own strong foreign intelligence branch, and it's not clear how it will merge this with the SVR's, for instance), to find new positions for generals who are out of jobs, and to deal with renaming departments, rewriting regulations, and the various other forms of bureaucratic chaos that accompany big mergers.",
  "Russian President Putin meets with reporters during visit for summit of former Soviet republics at Manas airport outside Bishkek Thomson Reuters This past Sunday, as most of Russia focused its attention on parliamentary elections, the country's most popular daily, Kommersant, broke news of a story that, if true, could have consequences that last far beyond this latest round of Duma reshuffling.",
  "Russian President Putin meets members of Russian summer sports Paralympic team in Moscow Thomson Reuters\n\nWhen FSB Director Nikolai Patrushev, in December 2000, called his officers Russia's \"new 'nobility'\" — a nickname that agents in the KGB could have hardly dreamed of being applied to them — he was taking a cue from his boss.",
  "Efforts to strengthen the security services fit within this pattern of centralizing control; what's new is that he's decided the best way to strengthen them is to merge them into one gigantic service, with a fearsome name and a reputation that reminds any would-be dissidents of the most frightening days of the Soviet era.",
  "Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters\n\nIt was a prescient comment: By the mid-1990s, various component parts and functions of the old KGB had begun to make their way back to the FSK, like the liquid metal of the killer T-1000 android in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, slowly reconstituting itself after having been blown to bits.",
  "His main concern, at least at first, seemed to be minimizing competition between the secret services; as a result, in 2003, he allowed the FSB to absorb responsibility for the border troops and FAPSI — the electronic intelligence agency — and gave the service expanded powers over the army and police.",
  "Then Putin launched a new agency and gave it enormous powers: The Investigative Committee, a sort of Russian FBI, was tasked with conducting the most sensitive investigations, from the murders of Kremlin critics like Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov to prosecuting political activists.",
  "With elections pending in 2018, he's started selective repressions, placed governors and officials in jail, and removed old friends from key positions, in moves seemingly aimed at what his role model Yuri Andropov once called \"improv[ing] labor discipline.\"",

  "In a 1993 executive decree, Yeltsin lamented, reeling off a list of acronyms for various incarnations of the security agencies, that \"the system of the Cheka-OGPU-NKVD-MGB-NGKB-KGB-MB turned out to be incapable of being reformed.",
  "At the same time, the FSB has lost a certain something in this transition: Gone is any talk about a \"new nobility,\" and the agency is no longer being used as a recruitment base for other sectors of the government and economy.",
  "If the Kommersant story is true, it would mean Putin has finally made up his mind about the fate of the FSB: It is to once again be restored to its former glory, as the most powerful security organ in the country by far.",
  "The KGB branch that had been responsible for protecting Soviet leaders was renamed the Federal Protective Service, or FSO, and the Soviet border guards were transformed into an independent Federal Border Service, or FPS.",
  "The shift from \"K\" (kontrrazvedka, or counterintelligence) to \"B\" (bezopasnost, or security) was more than cosmetic; with the new name came a broad mandate for the FSB to become the guardian of \"security\" for Russia.",
  "The president began using the FSB as his main recruitment base for filling key positions in government and state-controlled business; its agents were expected to define and personify the ideology of the new Russia.",
  "And if its combination of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance looks familiar, well, it should: In all but name, we are seeing a resurrection of the Committee for State Security — otherwise known as the KGB.",
  "This was accompanied by an expansion of the Internal Troops — army units charged with operating within the country — and the launch of a new Department to Counter Extremism, housed within the Interior Ministry.",

  "A relatively obscure directorate of the KGB that guarded secret underground facilities continued its functions under a new name: the Main Directorate of Special Programs of the President, or GUSP.",
  "The Russian daily reported that the idea of the reforms is to merge the Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, with the Federal Security Service, or FSB, which keeps an eye on domestic affairs.",
  "Dennis Grombkowski/Getty Images\n\nThroughout the 2000s, and for much of the 2010s, it looked as if Putin's response to concerns about FSB ineffectiveness would be simply to create new agencies.",
  "It would once again be given responsibility for pursuing dissidents, who were now branded \"extremists,\" and would be given its own foreign intelligence directorate, duplicating the SVR's.",
  "REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nThe division of the KGB responsible for electronic eavesdropping and cryptography became the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information, or FAPSI.",
  "The KGB, it should be remembered, was not a traditional security service in the Western sense — that is, an agency charged with protecting the interests of a country and its citizens.",
  "But the president, himself a former KGB officer, was too taken in by KGB myths about the role of the Cheka in Russian society to be satisfied with the FSB being a mere security organ.",
  "But Yeltsin's team never formed a clear strategy for how to transform what had once been the secret services of a totalitarian state into the intelligence community of a democracy.",
  "In 2007, he asked another service, an antidrug agency led by his personal friend Viktor Cherkesov, to look into the FSB's dealings, in the hope, it seems, of bringing it down.",
  "It ran operations both inside and outside the country, but in both spheres the main task was always to protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the Kremlin.",
  "Putin has made it clear that what he needs is an instrument, pure and simple, to protect his own regime — just like the Politburo had its instrument in the KGB.",
  "Reorganization efforts in recent years were external and cosmetic in nature.… The system of political investigation is preserved and may easily be restored.\"",

  "Finally, this year, Putin created the National Guard, which is a massive and armed-to-the-teeth military force tasked with fighting internal dissent.",
  "Ironically, however, it seems likely that the announced reforms will not actually improve FSB effectiveness — if anything, they'll do the opposite.",
