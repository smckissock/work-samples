  "Alex Davies / Business Insider The Jaguar F-Type R with its 550-horsepower V-8 is mind-bendingly fast, and it doesn't hurt that the car also sounds like an angry god.",
  "Apparently, that isn't enough because the Jaguar Land Rover Special Vehicles Operations skunk works has pieced together a monstrous 575-horsepower Jaguar F-Type SVR.",
  "It appears pictures from a brochure and some details have leaked before what must be the F-Type SVR's Geneva Motor Show debut.",
  "According to Autoblog.nl and other Dutch car sites, the SVR-enhanced F-Type will have a supercharged V-8 with all-wheel drive.",
  "Word has it those will include carbon-ceramic brakes, a lighter titanium exhaust, and upgraded suspension.",
  "Stay tuned for more details as we approach the 2016 Geneva Motor Show's March 1 opening day.",
  "Obviously upgrades are required to create an F-Type with this kind of power and speed.",
  "To think a Jaguar F-Type of this caliber is coming simply makes the body tingle.",
  "The 0-60 mph run will take just 3.7 seconds and the top speed will be 200 mph.",
  "There's also a big rear spoiler and we can only imagine even more noise.",
  "We've already driven the Range Rover Sport SVR, and it's pretty nutty.",
  "Frankly, it's one of the best-sounding cars on the planet.",
  "Oh, and it supposedly goes 200 mph."
