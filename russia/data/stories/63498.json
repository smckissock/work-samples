  "For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.”) Early posts included “Misogyny Gets You Laid” and “When Should You Compliment a Woman?” (Answer: “During or after sex.”) Early in Shauna’s relationship with Mike, she read Danger and Play, including such posts as “How to Cheat on Your Girlfriend.” She said, “I would come home from work crying—‘How can you write such rude things?’ He’d go, ‘You don’t understand, babe, this is just how guys talk.’ ” (Advice from the blog: “Always call your girl ‘babe,’ ” to avoid mixing up names.)",
  "The afternoon before Clinton’s speech, Mike Cernovich, a thick-chested white man in his late thirties, sitting on a veranda in Southern California, opened the live-streaming app Periscope on his iPad and filmed a video called “How to fight back against Sick Hillary and the #ClintonNewsNetwork.” By “Clinton News Network,” he meant CNN and other corporate media outlets.",
  "“Mainstream media we’ve lost.” He said he hoped that Clinton’s Reno speech would elicit “a full-scale media attack on me,” adding, “I want this to become an international trending topic.” Clinton did not mention Cernovich, but she attacked Alex Jones, the paranoiac Texas radio host, and Breitbart.com, the Pravda of the alt-right.",
  "“We have to think of a good hashtag, and we have to have all of our memes lined up.” He suggested talking points for his followers to deploy, such as “If the alt-right is racist, is Israel racist, too?” Cernovich prefers to call himself an “American nationalist,” but he often uses “we” when discussing the alt-right movement.",
  "“I don’t seem like a guy who reads Lacan, do I?” These days, Cernovich’s primary target is the “hoaxing media.” He told me, “The mainstream media has lost so much legitimacy at this point that if they reported, ‘We just saw Trump beat the shit out of a guy on the street,’ skeptical people like my readers would go, ‘Really?",
  "“The smartest kid in the class above me got into the University of Chicago, and I went, ‘What’d he do wrong?’ Because, in my mind, a city is smaller than a state, so the University of Illinois had to be a better school.” Cernovich’s parents and his three siblings still live in the area, but he rarely visits or calls home.",
  "Now, however ridiculous what you’re saying is, if you make it memetically successful, something really bad can spread through the culture.”\n\nCernovich had another red-pill moment during a trip to Budapest, where he saw hundreds of Syrian émigrés camped out in a train station, waiting to be resettled elsewhere in Hungary.",
  "Cernovich wrote a post called “Complete Timeline of Hillary’s Health #HillarysHealth,” which included such data points as “peculiar travel habits” and “lengthy naps.” It got two hundred and forty thousand page views—less than a marquee Huffington Post story, but impressive for a blog with no advertising budget.",
  "“I will not accept a scam award from a scam organization.”\n\nThere is a lot of discussion in certain parts of the Internet about “red-pill moments.” In the 1999 film “The Matrix,” the hero faces a choice: the blue pill will allow him to stay within a comfortable delusion; the red pill will cause him to wake up.",
  "He also writes about how to build a personal brand online; his maxims include “Conflict is attention” and “Attention is influence.” Although he doesn’t appear on Fox News or syndicated radio shows, he is an expert at using social media to drive alt-right ideas into the heart of American political discourse.",
  "Before closing his laptop, he checked his direct messages on Twitter, and found a tip alleging that, in 2014, a Reddit user had asked for help removing a “VERY VIP” e-mail address “from a bunch of archived e-mail.” The tipster claimed that the Reddit user was Paul Combetta, one of Hillary Clinton’s I.T.",
  "“I use trolling tactics to build my brand.” Pro-Trump activism channelled several of Cernovich’s interests: he could hurt a feminist’s chances of becoming President, associate himself with the year’s top story, and deploy brawler methods on behalf of someone who is even more ruthless online than he is.",
  "In late August, Hillary Clinton announced that she would soon give a speech, in Reno, Nevada, linking Donald J. Trump to what has become known as the alt-right—a loose online affiliation of white nationalists, neo-monarchists, masculinists, conspiracists, belligerent nihilists, and social-media trolls.",
  "Yiannopoulos, writing on Breitbart the next day, called Clinton’s speech “a drive-by shooting with a water pistol fired from a mobility scooter.” Alex Jones recorded a video in which he stood in his back yard, wiping sweat from his brow, as he muttered about the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.",
  "She wants to let in more so-called refugees, which makes her an existential threat to the West.” (He calls the Syrian refugee crisis a “media lie.”) “But I was looking at the conversation online—what was getting through to people and what wasn’t—and none of that was sticking.",
  "The term “meme” was coined by Richard Dawkins, in his 1976 book, “The Selfish Gene”; he defined it as any “unit of cultural transmission” that stays alive by “leaping from brain to brain.” In a footnote to the 1989 edition, he wrote, “Computers are increasingly tied together.",
  "“Somebody on Twitter did it.” Cernovich told me, “He’ll never mention me by name, but he’s at least listening to the periphery.” “I think we overordered.” People have always expressed extreme views online, but for many years there was no easy way for such opinions to spread.",
  "“At the same time, he hates Trump, because he’s, like, ‘If he’s saying negative things about different groups, then how do we know he’s not going to come after Persians one day?’ Even if you believe certain things, you shouldn’t necessarily say it openly.” Mike shrugged.",
  "When he bragged about this on Twitter, one of his followers replied, “Guerrilla Mindset: How Mike Cernovich waged war on journalism and won.” “Some people say they hate Beltway insiders and establishment media types, but it’s actually sour grapes,” Cernovich said.",
  "That day, Chris Cillizza, a centrist pundit at the Washington Post, wrote an article titled “Hillary Clinton’s Health Just Became a Real Issue in This Campaign.” Scott Greer, a deputy editor of the Daily Caller, tweeted, “Cernovich memed #SickHillary into reality.",
  "The Constitution guarantees that the government won’t restrict what you can say; it does not guarantee that you can shout obscenities on CNN, or that you can harass co-workers, or that you can make racist arguments without being made to feel like a racist.",
  "“I’ve gained twenty pounds during this fucking election.” He told me that he’d been reading Andrew Breitbart’s 2011 autobiography, “Righteous Indignation”: “There’s a part where he’s on a plane for five hours, without Wi-Fi, and he has withdrawal symptoms.",
  "Cernovich thought that Clinton’s speech “was the stupidest thing she could have done.” He added, “Her social-media advisers are twenty-four-year-old basic bitches who feel triggered by us, and so they asked their boss to yell at us and make us go away.",
  "Cernovich said, “Going by the statistics, I’m less influential than some people”—Trump, say, or Kim Kardashian—“but way more influential than some punk blogger at Politico or The Weekly Standard who thinks of himself as part of the media élite.",
  "Instead of picking up a newspaper or visiting its home page, people scan their social-media accounts, where myriad information sources—the Daily Mail, links posted by Steph Curry, a distant relative’s Facebook rants—compete for their attention.",
  "If people think that’s inherently racist, fine—but I’m an American nationalist, not a white nationalist.” A few people at the meet-up were white nationalists—not the skinhead type but the more polished, just-asking-the-question variety.",
  "On his blog, Cernovich developed a theory of white-male identity politics: men were oppressed by feminism, and political correctness prevented the discussion of obvious truths, such as the criminal proclivities of certain ethnic groups.",
  "On the Internet, he represents himself as a “Pulitzer-worthy journalist” who runs Cernovich Media, a “global worldwide brand.” When we first spoke, on the phone, I asked him whether he worked from home or in an office full of employees.",
  "And, in another post: “If Trump offends you, it’s because you live in a cucked world where no one speaks their minds.”\n\nWhile I was in California, Cernovich hosted a meet-up for his readers, on the boardwalk in Hermosa Beach.",
  "Yeah, just keep throwing them out.” He overlooked #hillaryshitmen and #hillarysmigrantcuntlickers, as well as a commenter who wrote, “Nice tea kettle of flowers Cuck.” After a few minutes, Cernovich chose #HillarysMigrants.",
  "“What’s fun is when you get a hot story and watch the number tick up into the thousands, like a video game.” Nowadays, the blog is mostly a platform for pro-Trump spin, but at first it was about how to pick up women.",
  "Imagine what her brain looks like.” Next, he tweeted a picture of Clinton winking, which he interpreted as “a mild stroke.” By August, he was declaring that she had both a seizure disorder and Parkinson’s disease.",
  "I thought that the health stuff would be more visceral, more resonant from a persuasion standpoint, and so I pushed that.” On September 11th, Clinton fainted after attending a memorial service at Ground Zero.",
  "“If I have a really hot story, I might leak it to someone at Breitbart, or to someone else who can get the Drudge link.” That journalist usually returns the favor by embedding a Cernovich tweet in the story.",
  "“I never disavow things I’ve said.” Throughout our September conversations, he referred to his more misogynist remarks as “locker-room talk.” His political analysis was nearly as crass as his dating advice.",
  "Cernovich calls Yiannopoulos “one of the only guys, other than me, who’s doing social media right.” Before the current election, Cernovich and Yiannopoulos were known primarily as Internet misogynists.",
  "The word “sick” described Clinton morally and physically: Cernovich was among the first to insinuate publicly that Clinton had a grave neurological condition, and that the media was covering it up.",
  "In 1922, Walter Lippmann, in his book “Public Opinion,” warned of “the manufacture of consent,” a power that media gatekeepers could use for good or for ill. That was a twentieth-century problem.",
  "“What about Hillary’s body count?” a young man asked, referring to rumors that Clinton has ordered the killing of several enemies—among them John F. Kennedy, Jr.—or has murdered them herself.",
  "They get that he likes Trump and that he puts stuff on the Internet—they just don’t get how that’s a job.” Her parents are secular Persian Muslims who left Iran before it became a theocracy.",
  "“We definitely need to remind the world that Hillary Clinton is bringing in the terrorists.” Viewers made suggestions, and Cernovich, monitoring the feed on his laptop, read them aloud.",
  "Initially, he said, the “power arrangement” was “fifty-fifty.” Then came a realization: “What she actually wanted was for me to be more assertive, to be the man in the relationship.",
  "“If it’s on ‘Hannity,’ then Brian Stelter’s talking about it on CNN.” The Drudge Report favors big newspapers and established right-wing blogs; Danger and Play is not on the list.",
  "“Logic is pointless.” Although he disdained electoral politics (“No thinking man buys into this two-party political system”), he was in an ideal position to foresee Trump’s rise.",
  "Many of the tweets included images, as he’d requested: Clinton and Merkel laughing conspiratorially; a caricature of Clinton as a ventriloquist’s dummy, sitting on Soros’s lap.",
  "He went on for twenty more minutes, referring to George Soros’s son six times as a “basic bitch.” He ended the Periscope video and searched for #HillarysMigrants on Twitter.",
  "People are tired of pussies.” Politics is a blood sport, but, during the primaries, Jeb Bush and the rest of Trump’s “cuckservative” opponents preferred to be genteel.",
  "His opponents were beta males, losers, or “cucks”—alt-right slang for “cuckolds.” “To beat a person, you lower his or her social status,” he wrote on Danger and Play.",
  "Shauna, who has stopped working, continued, “I was still upset, though, and he eventually deleted some older posts.” “I rewrote some of the wording,” Mike insisted.",
  "“If I still believed in Jesus, we could talk about that.” As we spoke, a fan sent him a message: Rush Limbaugh had just mentioned #ZombieHillary on his radio show.",
  "She listed some recent Breitbart headlines, including “Would You Rather Have Feminism or Cancer?,” which were written by Milo Yiannopoulos, the fame-seeking troll.",
  "The term typically applies to conservatives and reactionaries who are active on the Internet and too anti-establishment to feel at home in the Republican Party.",
  "“It’s just a thing on the Internet.” At times, it can seem like anything—a dead gorilla, a rape threat, a Presidential election—is just a thing on the Internet.",
  "For his part, Trump may have changed his mind about almost every policy proposal and campaign strategy, but he consistently maintains that journalists are scum.",
  "Objectively, I am the new media.”\n\nAs Shauna Cernovich was leaving the house to visit her parents, she told me, “They don’t fully understand what Michael does.",
  "The site devotes a prominent place to its list of trending topics—the most discussed phrases and hashtags of the moment, according to a proprietary algorithm.",
  "On his first blog, which he started in 2004, he offered a libertarian critique of prosecutorial overreach, emphasizing free speech and false rape allegations.",
  "In the meantime, he says, he got by with “freelance legal research” and “appellate stuff.” Cernovich’s wife earned millions of dollars in stock from an I.P.O.",
  "“When I first started, that meant figuring out how news cycles work.” One way to propel a story into the mainstream is to get it linked by the Drudge Report.",
  "Not me.” Cernovich’s affiliation with GamerGate made him, he said, “toxic in the eyes of a lot of people,” but he calculated that the exposure was worth it.",
  "In 2003, he was accused of raping a woman he knew; the charge was later dropped, but a judge ordered him to do community service for misdemeanor battery.",
  "(@beelman_matt: “PC is for PUSSIES”; @ciswhitemale: “Mike is a bosss.”) Cernovich wore a plaid shirt, partially unbuttoned to display his chest hair.",
  "Internet activism is sometimes derided as “slacktivism”—a fair characterization when an online campaign tries to, say, cure AIDS or end child labor.",
  "The hashtag, referring to Clinton’s supposed frailty, had trended the previous day on Twitter, after Cernovich encouraged his followers to use it.",
  "Now Breitbart.com gets more traffic than the Los Angeles Times, and Steve Bannon, Breitbart’s former editor-in-chief, is running Trump’s campaign.",
  "Never doubt the power of memes.” Without months of priming by Cernovich and others, Clinton’s collapse might have been seen as an isolated event.",
  "Walter Cronkite was once the most trusted man in America; in 2013, according to a Reader’s Digest survey, the most trusted person was Tom Hanks.",
  "“It’s ‘1984.’ ” The prevailing logic was that, short of yelling fire in a crowded theatre, anyone should be able to say anything, in any venue.",
  "By then, the Reddit story had been covered by Vice and New York, and a congressman had asked prosecutors in Washington, D.C., to look into it.",
  "Instead of being offended by blackface or pictures of dead babies, you are encouraged to see them as funny, even if you don’t understand why.",
  "He poured himself a coffee, sat down, and read articles about Ahmad Rahami, who was suspected of planting bombs in New Jersey and Manhattan.",
  "It also includes extremist commentators, long belittled or ignored by the media, whom mainstream pundits are now starting to take seriously.",
  "“The narrative is being written, and you’d better get off your fucking asses and write your own.” His feed filled with real-time comments.",
  "#AltRightMeans.” The hashtag was already trending on Twitter, as the alt-right’s supporters and opponents competed to define the movement.",
  "(“Conflict is attention.”) And in 2014 he became a champion of GamerGate, a vicious campaign against feminists in the video-game industry.",
  "At the meet-up, a pudgy man wore a T-shirt with a picture of Harambe, the gorilla that was killed earlier this year at the Cincinnati Zoo.",
  "“In the past, I would’ve been tempted to say, about the Internet, that although everybody has a megaphone, in many cases it’s a quiet one.",
  "“He grabbed my arm, pulled me into him, and said, ‘You fit nicely.’ ” “It sounds creepy, but it looked less creepy in context,” Mike said.",
  "And the alt-right rumors may have prompted Clinton to be secretive about having pneumonia, making it a bigger story when it was revealed.",
  "Media consumers don’t believe everything they read, and, because of personalization algorithms, no two social-media feeds look the same.",
  "“Then I’d have to say hi every time I see them, and maybe they’d want to be friends—nah, not worth it.” Cernovich trained as a lawyer.",
  "The alt-right has no consistent ideology; it is a label, like “snob” or “hipster,” that is often disavowed by people who exemplify it.",
  "Words, no.” “Neither party seems to be talking about cats.” He stood up and stretched, thrusting his chest forward and his arms back.",
  "Post pictures of the terrorist attacks.” While he was talking, Shauna returned home and sat on a couch in the background of the shot.",
  "“Pure trolls are amoral”—they post swastikas, he suggested, not out of an allegiance to Nazism but because they enjoy riling people.",
  "“I’ll show you.” He propped his iPad upright on the kitchen table, so that the camera lens faced the mirror, and started filming.",
  "Ever since the advent of the mass media, professional journalists have been a bulwark against seditious or far-fetched theories.",
  "Some attendees proudly called themselves “deplorables,” and many praised Cernovich as a corrective to traditional journalism.",
  "Until recently, it was the top seller in that category, ahead of “We Should All Be Feminists,” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.",
  "“I think it’ll be good for him, soften him up a bit.” “I’ll be nice to her, as long as she’s not a basic bitch,” Mike said.",
  "Most conversations touched on free speech (which everyone was for) and political correctness (which everyone was against).",
  "Our average one has hundreds of thousands.” His video was viewed more times than the official upload of Clinton’s speech.",
  "Cernovich realized that a meme could reach more people than a newspaper story, without having to cross an editor’s desk.",
  "“We were making out, like, five minutes later.” Mike said that, when they started dating, “I didn’t take it seriously.",
  "He had recently moved to a cul-de-sac where every house has stucco walls, a ceramic tile roof, and bland xeriscaping.",
  "They just made us stronger.”\n\nCernovich lives fifty miles south of Los Angeles, in a deep-red congressional district.",
  "In mid-October, Cernovich released another book, “maga Mindset,” about Trump’s “unapologetically masculine” persona.",
  "In 2010, when the right-wing provocateur Andrew Breitbart started a blog called Big Journalism, the name was ironic.",
  "He instructed his followers, “Remind people that Angela Merkel, George Soros, Hillary Clinton—they’re all together.",
  "His self-published 2015 book, “Gorilla Mindset,” is a manual for men who want to “unleash the animal” within them.",
  "His mother didn’t finish high school; his father bounced between factory jobs, eventually working at a junk yard.",
  "When the goal is to seed social media with misinformation, though, online organizing can be shockingly effective.",
  "People pointed at the shirt and snickered, adding, “Dicks out for Harambe.” I asked the man to explain the joke.",

  "Developments in the Rahami case were big news in the New York area, but not everywhere on the Internet.",
  "Visible behind him were a swimming pool, trimmed boxwoods, and a mountain glowing in the afternoon sun.",
  "Political spin battles are waged online every minute, and it can be difficult to gauge who is winning.",
  "Cernovich says that during college, at the University of Illinois, he was socialized to be submissive.",
  "“I was friends with a lot of girls who had crushes on me, but I was too polite to fuck them,” he said.",
