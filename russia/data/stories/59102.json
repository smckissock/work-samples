  "JENNIFER GRANHOLM, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I mean, I actually do agree with Mike, that it looks like there are other issues at play which is politics and the president's own hide and I just worry -- I mean, we need to have a healthy Republican and Democratic Party that is not just -- and this -- this worries me -- honestly, I mean, even as a Democrat that the Republicans are doing the bidding of the president and thereby undermining the FBI.",
  "I would even support, if it could be redacted in such a way as to not be damaging, I would support releasing the underlying FISA applications, because what America would see -- and I don't know how long these things are -- but they would see dozens and dozens and dozens of pages citing all sorts of facts and all sorts of -- you would see a very comprehensive project that gets put together by 10, 12 people at the FBI, then presented to a federal judge.",
  "TAPPER: You're on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee put out a statement -- the Democrats on the committee put out a statement saying that, \"House Republicans are now accomplices to a shocking campaign to obstruct the work of the Special Counsel to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the Justice Department and the FBI to bury the fact that a foreign adversary interfered with our last election.\"",
  "I mean, Rick, even when you start publicly saying that the FBI has been hiding information, it gives this whole deep state conspiracy crank stuff more oxygen --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: But they did hide information, they didn't -- they withheld information to (ph) the (ph) Congress (ph) and they're still withholding information to (ph) Congress (ph) --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: They're withholding classified information, perhaps.",

  "In fact, on the Senate side the Foreign Relations Committee, the minority put out a 200 page document that listed 10 specific actions that Congress could do to prevent Russian meddling in the election this year and all of that has been lost in this conversation about not just Carter Page and the memo but about whether Trump is just using the Republicans to cover his own behind.",
  "Because \"Time\" magazine obtained a letter Carter Page wrote in 2013 boasting about his connections with Russia -- quote -- \"Over the past half year I have had the privilege to serve as an informal adviser to the staff of the Kremlin in preparation, for their Presidency of the C-20 Summit next month where energy issues would be a prominent on the agenda.\"",
  "The other thing is, I think it's a false narrative when you say what -- that Mr. McCabe wasn't quoted correctly, because there was an attorney from the FBI who was part of the -- the FISA application and also was in on the interviews that said that that was an accurate statement that the -- that this couldn't have gone through without the dossier.",
  "That they're agenda of passing the tax, what they call tax reform but we know it was tax cuts, they blew this deficit up so that now they can come back and talk about Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare, that that agenda is so much more important than the safety of our elections and our Democratic process.",
  "GRANHOLM: But Congress -- and Congress can -- and Congress can see classified information and I'm not sure what information you're saying they're withholding but when you say stuff like that, when the president says the stuff he does it's --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: They withheld for a year whether the DNC paid for this.",
  "What we are going to learn when the Democratic -- if and when -- and we certainly hope that it is -- the Democratic memo is released, which is a sort of counterpoint to the Republican memo, what we will learn is that it is not true that this FISA warrant was awarded solely on the basis of the Steele dossier.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: I think we have a crossed a deeply regrettable line in this committee where, for the first time in the 10 years or so that I have been on the committee, there was a vote to politicize the declassification process of intelligence and potentially compromise sources and methods.",
  "TAPPER: I want to ask you about the fact that the president, as you alluded to, it seems pretty clear from the response of Trump and his allies to the memo that it could, if not likely, will be used as pretext for the president to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or special counsel Bob Mueller.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: But Donald Trump mentioned him as one of the people that were advising him at a time when he didn't have very many advisers --\n\n\n\nBASS: The point is it was well before it was -- it was well before --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Yes, the investigation -- the investigation.",
  "To me I know that they're concerned about their agenda but the fact that they would really go this far that to put out a memo that they would participate in undermining the investigation or at least that's what they hope that this memo does and so I just think that's a really sad thing.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Now, it seems as though the judge was told that the information from the Steele dossier was funded by a political source, but it was not specifically referred to as having been paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.",

  "They're trying to determine is an intelligence officer operating in the United States, are they cooperating intelligence -- or a person in the United States who would have access to give them information that they need, then it would spin-off into criminal investigation.",
  "The Democrats have been protesting the changes that President Trump has proposed to the legal immigration system, limiting family reunification, or so-called chain migration, so it's only for spouses and minor children, and ending outright the diversity visa lottery.",
  "And by the way if they were really in the tank for Hillary Clinton as you're suggesting why wouldn't they have leaked that there was an investigation ongoing about Donald Trump instead of 10 days before the election a memo comes out about Hillary Clinton's e-mails?",
  "And the fact that the Republicans in the House refused to allow a minority report, the Democratic response to their memo, is an indication that this -- they're just bound and determined to continue to find ways to absolve this president from any responsibility.",
  "Former Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Congressman and former FBI agent Mike Rogers, what's your response when you hear the president's son saying that the Nunes memo provides a little bit of sweet revenge in it for him and his family?",
  "TAPPER: Senator, a CNN poll after the government shutdown, when Democrats forced a government shutdown over the dreamers two weeks ago, found that 56 percent of Americans polled thought that keeping the government open was more important than continuing DACA.",
  "Secondarily, Adam Schiff, when he offered the motion to release the memo side by, he said, we Democrats will do something that you Republicans are refusing to do, which is, we will run this by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",

  "I mean, this is really the first time something like this has happened --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Look, I think what's -- I think what you heard from Brad and what you heard from Speaker Ryan and others is really what Republicans are coming from.",
  "BASS: But the fact -- but the fact that they have gone this far to put out a memo like this where they only put out partial information as to say that the only reason why there was an investigation was because of the dossier and they know better.",
  "I don't see a government shutdown coming, but I do see a promise by Senator McConnell to finally bring this critical issue that affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in America, finally bringing it to a full debate in the Senate.",
  "[09:35:01]\n\n\n\nSo the idea that they weren't leaking information, the people at the FBI, you have, you know, the two people with their -- with their --\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: Well, it was a botched leak, that's for sure because it really didn't work.",
  "I mean, John McCain basically said that releasing this memo or what he's seeing happened we do not want to be the tools of Russia because remember, this whole thing is about Russia meddling in the election and nothing has happened on that.",
  "TAPPER: I was reminded this weekend by Evan Perez, our Justice Department reporter, that the Clinton Foundation probe by the FBI, one of the bases for that was Peter Schweizer's book \"Clinton Cash,\" which obviously had partisan roots.",
  "Republicans think this is fantastic and Democrats think it's, you know, the worst thing ever and what we'll lose here is the truth and we should never sacrifice the truth in a partisan area where there's classified information.",
  "You, in 2013, voted for the gang of eight immigration bill that contained similar provisions, ending visa diversity lottery and eliminating the ability of brothers and sisters to enter the country on family reunification visas.",
  "I think they see this as a real problem within the government and within the Obama administration of politicizing not just the DOJ but the IRS and every other agency of government to come after conservatives and Republicans.",
  "TAPPER: So, Senator, just to play devil's advocate here, one could really look at this objectively and say, look, I get what you're saying about the Nunes memo, but the Democratic Party isn't exactly bathed in glory here.",
  "He also used Twitter to declare himself cleared in the ongoing Russia investigation after the release of a Republican four- page memo alleging the FBI abused its surveillance tools during and afternoon the 2016 election.",
  "I mean, I think, you can say, Carter Page was not someone who was deeply involved in the campaign but if the FBI thought so and they were -- and they went about a process to spy on him because of that that's the problem.",
  "But I would certainly support that release, because then the American people would see how comprehensive the FISA application process is, rather than the way it's being characterized as secret, dark, behind closed doors.",
  "The House Intelligence Committee, which has in the past filed a long nonpartisan and bipartisan tradition, is now at the center of a fierce partisan fight over the release of a controversial previously classified memo.",
  "And as far as the Democrat memo, when we were in our meeting, I think we saved the Democrats from some hypocrisy here, because Adam Schiff was making the case that we should not release our memo unless it was vetted.",
  "Here you have a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a former FBI agent saying, let's have the IG look at whether or not there was an abuse of the FISA system in any way, could you get behind that?",
  "And, so, any time you interject something other than getting\n\n\n\n[09:30:00]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: What's your response when you hear the president's son saying that the Nunes memo provides sweet revenge for his and his family?",
  "A matter of fact, in 2000 there was a particular case on the FISA court where an agent was removed from the case because they didn't think that he was -- that had veracity in his presentation of his application.",
  "They had -- Russians were sending out these photos of Aziz Ansari with his head Photoshopped over a sign that said avoid the lines, text your vote here specifically targeted on social media to first time voters.",
  "What's interesting we watch them do this in the '70s and the '80s but they used to do it by sending a spy, trying to recruit a reporter to write a story --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nROGERS: -- find an opposition party.",
  "Oh, we just went out, we found a few things, we got a dossier, we got in a room, we huddled up, we wrote up an application, went down to the judge and there you go we're spying on the United States citizen.",
  "But, finally -- and this is a point that I don't think gets a lot of attention -- just because it was paid for -- and, remember, that dossier started as part of an effort done by Republicans, not Democrats.",
  "But to say that that's the end of the investigation, that this is all that Donald Trump needs to fire Rosenstein or to fire Bob Mueller, I will just tell you, this could precipitate a constitutional crisis.",
  "I do think there should be an investigation should be at the IG where they can conduct the interviews, they'll have access to all the FISA applications and then they can come up with a plan to remedy it.",
  "Trey Gowdy, who is retiring from the House, a Republican conservative from South Carolina, said he saw nothing in this memo that undermined the investigation and he still had confidence in Bob Mueller.",
  "We ought to be trying to focus on an investigation on a professional level by Bob Mueller, and not trying to find a way to obstruct justice or to absolve this president from any responsibility he has.",
  "So I'm a -- I'm a former federal prosecutor, I'm going into court, I've got an FBI agent on the stand and now I have to worry about whether my jury has Republicans on it because they hate the FBI now?",
  "The question at that moment is whether or not the majority Republicans in the House and the Senate will stand up for the rule of law and the Constitution if the president takes that extreme position.",
  "But we understand what the Constitution says we must do, and that is hold everyone in the United States, including the president of the United States, accountable if they have violated the law.",
  "But would you support the release of any relevant transcript that would support what McCabe thinks about how important the Steele dossier was to the FISA warrant, just so we can clear this up?",
  "TAPPER: Well, I think, in point of fact, the opposition research project was funded by Republicans, but the Steele dossier, per se, was funded by Democrats, but this appears to be a dry well.",
  "TAPPER: The conservative -- the conservative drumbeat growing louder after the release of this Republican memo calling on President Trump to fire the man overseeing the Russia investigation.",
  "TAPPER: A new poll shows more Americans are rooting for the underdog Eagles, but as President Trump well knows, in sports, as in presidential politics, it's not the popular vote that counts.",
  "The only reason to do this so to support the president and to go that far to support the president to push their agenda, I just think -- I mean, I don't know where we're going with this.",
  "And I would go a step further, which is, this all -- part of the problem with the process here is that conclusions and allegations have been drawn based on the FISA warrant applications.",
  "But to say now that we can say, as the president said, it's all over, stop the investigation, I'm above the law, and I shouldn't be investigated any further, that is an extreme position.",
  "[09:55:00]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: But their relationship has been, shall we say, deflated since President Trump took on NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality.",
  "In response to the president's tweet, a former senior national security official told me -- quote -- \"As a public servant, I was taught to never take official action for personal gain.",
  "But would you -- would you grant the point that the DNC and the Clinton campaign should have disclosed much earlier than they did to the public that they actually funded this dossier?",
  "Over three million of them were going -- the backlog was going to be wiped away, and we were going to bring them in to the United States, and then moving forward change the standard.",
  "We will also learn that the FBI, because they are very careful people, didn't mislead the judge, that the judge had some sense that this information came out of a political context.",
  "At the same time, when I look at Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray, where they are, I know, in their agencies, they have tremendous patriots that do great work each and every day.",
  "Now when you consider the voter suppression ads that were being sent --\n\n\n\nBASS: What about the president setting up a voter suppression commission --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Yes.",
  "Because this has been a big point of contention that seems just factual in nature, although those of us who haven't -- you know, aren't privy to the transcripts of the interviews.",
  "He had a problem of connections with people that the FBI believed were Russian intelligence officials or were at least passing information back to Russian intelligence officials.",
  "But the fact they went after Carter Page when he was a target of FBI interest before -- remember, these -- these intelligence warrants are not necessarily for criminal activity.",
  "It was John McCain who said, trying to undermine the FBI and the Department of Justice is really not in the best interest of the America, and, frankly, it's doing Putin's work.",
  "And while I know who I'm rooting for, fly Eagles, fly, President Trump is staying uncharacteristically silent and that's the subject of this week's \"State of the Cartoonion.\"",
  "And what could happen at the end of this is you find out the information in -- that they found in those FISAs will disprove some of the common narratives are on the outside.",
  "If the House Republicans believe they have set the stage for this president to end this investigation, they are basically saying that, in America, one man is above the law.",
  "How can -- if Carter Page wasn't part of the campaign a year ago, year and a half ago, two years ago, then why is the FBI spying on Carter Page all of a sudden anti-Trump?",
  "SANTORUM: Well, I mean, they obviously were spying on Carter Page because they thought he was going to provide access to Trump, whether he did or not is another question.",
  "The fact that they have attacked the FBI, attacked the Department of Justice in the manner in which they've done, we've never seen that before, so why would they do this?",
  "TAPPER: Actually, I think -- just as a point of fact, I think the overall opposition research started by Republicans, but the Steele dossier, per se, was just Democrats.",
  "DURBIN: There is not likely to be a DACA deal, though we're working every single day, on telephone calls and person to person, to try to reach this bipartisan agreement.",
  "TAPPER: It's a central part of the controversial memo, but both sides dispute what the deputy FBI director actually said to members of the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "And the other point I want to make is...\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, the FBI did put out a statement saying that they thought it was incomplete, that there was omissions of facts.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:41:24]\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know.",
  "I mean, that would be off -- you know, off to the side and this narrative is going to continue to go and that's why I think your two guests here previously are right.",
  "And the fact is, the public didn't find out that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for the dossier until a little over three months ago in October 2017.",
  "TAPPER: I want you to take a listen to what the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Devin Nunes, said about the allegations laid out in the memo of FISA abuse.",
  "And the judge, in issuing a FISA warrant, has to weigh whether or not there's something in the background here that should disqualify the issuance of a warrant.",
  "As Americans wait for the Eagles and the Patriots to face off in the Super Bowl, President Trump is facing off with his own national security community leaders.",
  "They want to cut legal immigration into the United States of family members, some of whom who have waited 20 years or month to join up with their families here.",
  "Everyone is picking a side, including White House insider, such Kellyanne Conway, an Eagles fan from South Jersey who sees the matchup as a 2016 election remix.",
  "Before the memo was released, Democrats were sounding the alarm that putting it out could compromise national security and intelligence sources and methods.",
  "There was no collusion and there was no obstruction, the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, collusion is dead.",
  "Now they can talk to you in your living room on social media and that's the part we have to get --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Thirty seconds, Congresswoman.",
  "And so any time you interject something other than getting to the truth I'm concerned about it and now we have these competing narratives, competing memos.",
  "This really should be about getting to the bottom of the situation and I think the tweet as well as Don Junior's comment reveal what this is all about.",
  "The comprehensive immigration reform dealt with 11 million people in the United States and gave them a path to legal status over a long period of time.",
  "So, the Fusion GPS effort, which is the organization that did this, started as a Republican-funded effort, and then became a Democratic- funded effort.",
  "TAPPER: But the releasing classified information over the objection of the FBI director and seeing that as sweet revenge, how do you respond to that?",
  "Donald Trump --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBASS: -- Australians and that happened long before and so --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The Australians was -- George Papadopoulos.",
  "[09:45:01]\n\n\n\nThis person was on the radar of the FBI and in fact cooperated with the FBI in their prosecution of a spy recruiter during that period.",
  "So you can say, well, this is a partisan attempt by Republicans but it really is -- it's a partisan attempt to counter a narrative that's out there.",
  "It is an effort by them to make a different immigration policy in the future, one that envisions an America that is much different than it is today.",
  "The thing that is really amazing to me is that I don't understand why the Republican leadership would go so far as to support Trump in this manner.",
  "TAPPER: Just very quickly, do you think that this memo provides some sort of pretext for President Trump to fire Rod Rosenstein or Robert Mueller?",
  "I don't think most Republicans are looking at this as a vindication of Donald Trump and trying to get Donald Trump and the Mueller investigation.",
  "And I would be curious to ask a judge, did you know who paid for this dossier that's being presented to you, and would it have made a difference?",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: No idea who Carter Page is and yet today, the FBI spying on Carter Page means that the FBI was biased against Trump.",
  "The president spent Saturday golfing and complaining on Twitter that nobody's talking about his great jobs numbers, only Russia, Russia, Russia.",
  "This dossier was used for this FISA warrant, a surveillance warrant of a Trump official, and the Clinton campaign and the DNC didn't close that.",
  "But that is an issue that the judge in issuing the FISA warrant takes into consideration, and ultimately some other trier of fact will as well.",
  "HIMES: But the point is that just because it was opposition research -- I think Brad and I would agree on this -- doesn't mean that it's wrong.",
  "The bottom line is that they did leak lots of information that incriminated Donald Trump and caused this Russia investigation to get some leg.",
  "The point is you've got a poll out this weekend that says that 38 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of the FBI which has plummeted.",
  "If the president takes this extreme action, this presented action, I'm afraid that it could lead to a confrontation we do not need in America.",
  "And yet the House Republicans were bound and determined to do this in order to stop this investigation of the president and those around him.",
  "It was the FBI itself, not Adam Schiff, whom I respect very much, but\n\n\n\nthe FBI itself that said the release of this memo would be reckless.",
  "I know that the FBI is aware of past abuses by the FBI and I believe it was Comey that used to keep that horrific letter --\n\n\n\nGRANHOLM: Yes.",
  "My main concern is things like, did the court know that this was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and...\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The dossier.",
  "KELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He's not part of our national security or foreign policy briefings that we do now at all.",
  "But the fact is that we should be -- we should have countermeasures to try to prevent them and mess with them as much as we can on our side.",
  "In my view, this conflict of interest is the real story, not the memo itself, which doesn't contain much we didn't already know\" -- unquote.",
  "TAPPER: Two members of the House Intelligence Committee, a Democrat and a Republican, who disagree on the memo's release join us live next.",
  "The FBI does not take that that lightly and so what they're saying is, if there is another argument here then it should have been in there.",
  "And so Devin Nunes felt that Trey Gowdy, with his experience as a prosecutor and investigator, would be the better person to go look at it.",
  "DURBIN: Listen, this would be an extreme event and one that I say with some caution could create a constitutional crisis in this country.",
  "Here to help shed some light on some of the discrepancies are members from both sides of the aisle of the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "That is a near impossibility but where the Russians did meddle and I think we conflate these is using social media --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Yes.",
  "And the releases that have happened have happened because the counter narrative been out there a long time through leaks by the FBI.",
  "The intelligence chiefs felt the need to brief the incoming and outgoing presidents of the existence of the dossier in January 2017.",
  "So that's what muddies the waters here a little bit in the words of Strother Martin, what we have here is a failure to communicate.",
  "The Philadelphia Eagles have shown more grit, character, and courage this season than most of the folks I cover on a regular basis.",
  "They have really been a positive voice, Democrats and Republicans sitting in the same room working to try to solve this problem.",
  "DURBIN: What Nunes conveniently ignores is, this investigation was under way long before the involvement of the Steele dossier.",
  "DURBIN: Of course, you know as well, Jake, that the actual political motivation, beginning of this, was on the Republican side.",
  "There was no obstruction, the word now used because, after a year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, collusion is dead.",
  "In my opinion, what we're dealing with is a situation within our FISA court and how we process within our government agencies.",
  "[09:25:00]\n\n\n\nAnd I hope your appearance here is a sign of bipartisan cooperation to come on the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "In fact, the only people who have are Trey Gowdy, not Chairman Nunes -- and that's a pretty key fact here -- and Adam Schiff.",
  "And if the vetting process did occur, we know what the FBI and the Department of Justice said about the release of this memo.",
  "In just a few hours the Philadelphia Eagles will face off with the team some of you might have heard about from New England.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBASS: And so we do have an election a few months away and really that's where all of our efforts need to be.",
  "Carter Page is the central character in this controversial Republican memo alleging anti-Trump bias in the FBI for months.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Donald Trump Jr. referring to a little bit of sweet revenge in the release of the Nunes memo.",
  "But there are other Republicans who are saying, no, the whole thing is -- is corrupt, and the Mueller probe needs to end.",
  "And my argument here, again, is -- listen, this is exactly what we were talking about last week we thought would happen.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I don't want to alienate my good friends in New England, so I'm going to keep this positive.",
  "Do you vow right now that you will not shut the government down again if there is not a DACA deal before the deadline?",
  "And, by the way, it was Speaker Ryan who said to his conference, this is really not about the Mueller investigation.",
  "This may not be an issue where there are likely to be a lot of very highly sensitive of sources and methods exposed.",
  "The part of the Russian meddling, this is going to be very hard for the prosecution to even come close to collusion.",
  "TAPPER: There are a number of House Republicans, including Congressman Gowdy, who agree with Congressman Wenstrup.",
  "Its credibility has to be judged by law enforcement officials first, ultimately by a judge, and perhaps by a jury.",
  "We have with us Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congressman Brad Wenstrup of Ohio.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBASS: That's the most important --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The investigation was -- before (ph).",
  "But you know that what brought Carter Page to the attention of the FBI was\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Was Donald Trump -- yes.",
  "[09:20:04]\n\n\n\nAnd I don't recall Republicans objecting to that book being used for the Clinton Foundation probe.",
  "So, I think, when the facts are out here, this will turn out to be a very, very small and insignificant thing.",
  "TAPPER: So, would you support the release of the transcript of any relevant part of Andrew McCabe's testimony?",
  "Republicans who authorized its release say the memo exposes abuses within the FBI and the Justice Department.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nTAPPER (voice-over): It's America's game and the final battle is as American as it gets.",
  "He personally ordered the declassification of the memo not for political purposes, but for personal purposes.",

  "They have an opportunity to make it the finest hour for their agencies by -- by doing the right things.",
  "There is a difference between saying it's politically motivated and actually revealing who paid for it.",
  "But, nonetheless, it's good practice to run these by a full declassification process before you do it.",
  "Let's -- let's shed light on what's going on with the agencies that the taxpayers pay for, by the way.",
  "If they want to vet it, I'm all in favor of bringing it -- I want to shed light on all of this, Jake.",
  "I think the fact that the Russians tried to meddle in this election should be no surprise to anybody.",
  "The FISA warrant was really targeted at somebody they knew to be -- to have a relation with Russians.",
  "I hope people like Mr. Gowdy will continue to make those statements and stand behind the rule of law.",
  "The more information we can get out there now to settle some of these scores if you will the better.",
  "TAPPER: Congressman Bass, is there nothing in the Nunes memo that you think merits further scrutiny?",

  "It was actually a very successful leak in focusing a lot of attention on Donald Trump and Russia.",

  "Because you see Christopher Wray giving a video encouragement to buck up the troops.",

  "And so then they wanted to immediately release theirs without it being vetted.",
  "TAPPER: Would you support it, release...\n\n\n\nWENSTRUP: I would want to see it.",
