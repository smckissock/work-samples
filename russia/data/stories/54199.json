  "But we know enough to conclude that (1) the Russia connection to Trump World runs very deep, and Mueller is no doubt exploring its many tributaries; (2) if Trump is profoundly altering Washington, it is to make the most old-fashioned forms of influence-peddling more common and more blatant; (3) we need to figure out if any of the money sloshing around has found its way to Trump; and (4) Trump will play as fast and loose with fundamental changes in policy as he does with ethics and the truth.",
  "There have been reports about members of Trump’s family mixing personal business with government business, and some of Trump’s Cabinet members — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt heads the list — seem to take their ethical guidance from the top.",
  "Columnist\n\nOn the same day that President Trump recklessly pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal with Iran, the lawyer for adult-film star Stormy Daniels fired the informational equivalent of a heat- ­seeking missile at the Trump presidency.",
  "And the fact that one of the firms that paid into Cohen’s shell corporation was Columbus Nova brings the money question into direct contact with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.",

  "The Avenatti memo, the reliability of which was confirmed by journalists’ inquiries and public statements from some of the entities on it, raises the issue of potential corruption to a new level.",
  "Trump is regularly described as a “disrupter.” Those who praised him for this believed he would disrupt ways of doing business in Washington that have frustrated the citizenry for decades.",
  "Trump chooses to roll the dice on nuclear weapons, and rather than “drain the swamp,” he is on his way toward giving us one of the most corrupt periods in our history.",
  "In the process, he has brought us significantly closer to war in the Middle East — the very sort of conflict Trump repeatedly said the United States should avoid.",
  "Alas, another of Obama’s achievements on Trump’s chopping block is the former president’s success in running an administration remarkably free of corruption.",
