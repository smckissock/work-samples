  "Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, who also attended Code 2018, provided some insight: “There are times in history when regulation has actually entrenched big companies because they’re the most capable of complying.",
  "I think that’s a huge mistake, because I think that that would inhibit innovation.”\n\nSpiegel knows first-hand how hard it is to grow in the shadow of big tech, and regulations just add to his burdens.",
  "Ironically, big tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google benefit from a silver lining when it comes to being regulated — what hurts their competitors more only makes them stronger.",
  "We freely give up our data for shared entertainment on Facebook, for a Lyft to magically appear at our street corner or for Spotify to play just the right song over our Google Home speaker.",
  "We need regulations that preserve the magic of technology while accounting for externalities, or we risk living in an increasingly polarized world dominated by unintended consequences.",
