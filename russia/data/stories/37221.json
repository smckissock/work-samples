  "However, it is possible that the SCO [special counsel’s office] will seek approvals from the Criminal Division as required by statute, regulation, or policy, or may simply want to consult with subject-matter experts in the Criminal Division as appropriate in the normal course of department investigations.”\n\nBoyd explained that if confirmed, Benczkowski would talk to “appropriate ethics experts” at Justice “prior to his participation in or supervision of the SCO’s interaction with the Criminal Division.” Boyd stressed that Mueller’s boss would be Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein (because of Sessions’s recusal), but he left room for Benczkowski to advise.",
  "But when asked by the Judiciary Committee if he would recuse himself from the Russia investigation because of the Alfa connection, he answered: “I cannot commit to such a recusal at this time.”\n\nBenczkowski also told senators that in a December 2016 conversation with Sessions, he had criticized “mistakes” by James B. Comey, then FBI director, in handling the Hillary Clinton email investigation, “converting his role as FBI director into that of a prosecutor.",
  "I remain concerned he could provide a back channel to his old boss and to the man in the Oval Office who’s declared open war on the Mueller investigation, and that procedures in place are not adequate to detect or prevent this.”\n\nBenczkowski wouldn’t comment publicly, because of the pending vote on his nomination.",
  "Sarah Isgur Flores, the Justice Department spokesperson, said Benczkowski is “a talented and well- ­regarded lawyer with extensive experience” and that Justice is “eager for the Senate to confirm him.”\n\nThe Benczkowski nomination may seem like small potatoes.",
  "News reports in 2016 had explored the bank’s possible computer communications with Trump Tower, but Benczkowski told senators that two independent investigations later found no connection between the bank and the Trump Organization.",

  "The nominee is Brian Benczkowski, who served as head of the Trump transition team at Justice and was staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Sessions was the ranking Republican.",
