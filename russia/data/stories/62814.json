  "\"Whether Guccifer — or Marcel Lehel Lazar — is telling the truth about breaking into Clinton's server is yet to be determined, The Hill notes, but as part of his plea deal he will be required to tell the truth.Some observers speculate the government thinks Lazar knows something that can help with the Clinton investigation or it would not have extradited him from Romania where he already was serving a sentence.",
  "A plea deal struck by the Romanian hacker known as \"Guccifer\" is leading to speculation he could be cooperating with federal authorities looking into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server,\"We'll find out pretty soon if there's a there there with him,\" cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright told The Hill.",
  "That could mean he is bluffing about having hacked into Clinton's server, which she used for State Department business.As she seeks the presidency, Clinton has been dogged by allegations her unsecured server might have been hacked and sensitive state secrets exposed.",
  "\"And her campaign insists Lazar's claims of hacking into her server are unsubstantiated.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley last month sent a letter to Clinton asking if she had been notified by the Justice Department that her server had been hacked.",
  "Others believe he might simply have information on other cases the government is investigating.Lazar host told NBC News he found Clinton's server \"that was completely unsecured\" simply \"by running a scan.",
  "\"But Lazar has not publicly released any Clinton emails not related to her confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whose account he hacked into and first exposed Clinton's use of a private email server.",
  "She has repeatedly said she did not send or receive information that was classified \"at the time.",
  "So far, she has not responded, The Hill quoted a Judiciary Committee spokeswoman.",
  "\"Now we're going to find out if the rubber really meets the road.",
  "\"He told Fox News Channel \"it was easy."
