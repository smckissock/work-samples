  "Hadi Mizban/AP WASHINGTON (Reuters) - US District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced former Blackwater security guard Nicholas Slatten to life in prison for murder in connection with the 2007 massacre of 14 unarmed Iraqis, closing a chapter of the US war in Iraq that tested relations between the two countries.",
  "The guards had been in the employ of the US State Department, and had \"fired heavy machine guns and grenade launchers from their armored convoy in the mistaken belief they were under attack by insurgents\" in Baghdad's Nisour Square according to the Guardian.",
  "Two U.S. private security contractors investigate the site where a military armored bus was damaged by a roadside bomb on the highway near Baghdad International Airport in Baghdad, Iraq in this Saturday, Nov. 27, 2004 file photo.",
  "But the company was sold in 2010 and re-named Academi, and one of its subsidiaries signed $92 million in security contracts with the US State Department in 2013.",
  "Three other guards had been found guilty of manslaughter, but Slatten was the only one convicted of first-degree murder.",
  "The incident drew attention to the role of private security contractors in Iraq and tarnished Blackwater's reputation.",
  "Slatten is believed to have been the first to open fire.",
  "Slatten had been convicted by a jury in October."
