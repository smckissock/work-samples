  "But the very idea that the White House spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, didn't immediately shut that down, that Putin request, when she was asked about it this week, to me, shows a fundamental lack of communication within the administration and a lack of understanding of Putin's method and his tactics.",

  "Now, as to what Congress can do, they are a little limited, of course, because the executive branch is the one that sets foreign policy, but we have seen Congress impose some pretty significant sanctions on Russia, most notably, after the invasion of Ukraine, and they could do so again.",
  "I'm not in an executive position like that, but I have had a few press conferences in my life, because things bad happen around my commands, and I rehearsed it, and I would say to the guys, OK, tell me what the outcomes are, all right, and tell me what the tone of this is going to be.",

  "And it's also why you saw some Pennsylvania Democrats, Conor Lamb, Matt Cartwright, vote for the bill because they are in Trump country, and they realize that, and they would like to keep their office.",
  "So, Bill, there's a school of thought that says -- has said for some time, the president's trade threats are really just a negotiating ploy, that he will back away at the end and it won't go ahead.",
  "But if what you stand for something is hard-left politics, and you're running in sort of middle America, then the Democratic Party is not going to win as many seats as it might otherwise have won.",
  "And they had an agreement in the ‘90s that, you know, these countries would not become a part of NATO, but they ran towards NATO because they feared the intimidation and the coercion of Russia.",
  "But this was the same Barack Obama who spent eight years in office making overt appeals to voters based on race and sexual orientation and gender and, suddenly, he decides this is a bad thing.",

  "KEANE: And listen, I think this president -- I mean, despite this week of criticism, he's the toughest guy on Russia since Ronald Reagan, and the facts are on the table.",
  "In the meantime, I think the Russians need to know that there are a lot of us who fully understand what happened in 2016, and it really better not happen again in 2018.",
  "But I think he uses that as a framework, ongoing to have relationships and possibly even though the disagreements are significant, we may be able to make some progress.",
