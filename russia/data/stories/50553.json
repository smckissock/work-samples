  "The alternative summit’s roundtable will focus on three topics:\n\n1) the nature of the enemy we face – the Global Jihad Movement and its animating ideology of shariah, i.e., not something euphemistically and misleadingly called “violent extremism”;\n\n2) the actual degree to which the present policy for addressing this threat has been successful or a failure – a realistic appraisal devoid of the cheerleading, wishful thinking, misdirection and worse that colors Ms. Rice’s every utterance (predicatably, to include those served up at Brookings tomorrow) and that will be the leitmotif of the CVE Summit, with its official/Muslim Brotherhood and fellow-traveling participants;\n\n3) an alternative approach that is fact-based, non-submissive to jihadist threats and influence operations and, ideally based on a strategy proven to be successful in countering totalitarian ideologies bent on our destruction – i.e., the Secure Freedom Strategy modeled on the one President Reagan launched 32 years ago last month that sought, and achieved, the liquidation of Soviet communism and its “Evil Empire.”\n\nWatch the live-stream of the Defeat Jihad Summit at Breitbart.com or SecureFreedom.org next Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. for what promises to be an extraordinary event – and necessary corrective – to the failed Obama “strategy” and the insidious February 18 Counter-Violent Extremism fandango intended to dignify and promote it.",
  "The international conclave that actually holds promise for being illuminating, fact-based, and consequential is a counterpoint to the official event that will take place exactly a week before: Its sponsors, including my own Center for Security Policy, have given it a clarifying title: the “Defeat Jihad Summit.”\n\nLike Team Obama’s shindig, this meeting will be by invitation only and feature a number of eminent figures in foreign governments, as well as our own.",
  "Like the latest mutation of his doomed “strategy” for countering “ISIL”, er “DAISH,” which the mendacious Susan Rice will be rolling out tomorrow, that official confab will an exercise in disinformation, deflection and deceit, both about the reality of Islamic supremacism and the effectiveness of the steps the United States and its allies are taking to contend with it.",
  "Bobby Jindal, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, Britain’s Lord Malcolm Pearson, former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Pete Hoekstra, Danish free speech advocate Lars Hedegaard, former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, and roughly three dozen other freedom fighters.",
  "Later this month, leaders and other influential figures from around the world will come together to address in a realistic way the emerging – and potentially existential – threat facing our nation and its friends overseas, and to resolve how best to counter it.",
  "I am not talking about President Obama’s “Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Summit” that will be held on February 18.",
  "Among those participating in the Defeat Jihad Summit will be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov.",
  "Unlike the closed-door official function, however, ours will be live-streamed."
