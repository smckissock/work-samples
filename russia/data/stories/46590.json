  "AggregateIQ, which played a pivotal role in the Brexit campaign, suspended after reports it may have improperly obtained user data\n\nFacebook said in a statement: ‘We have added [AggregateIQ] to the list of entities suspended from our platform while we investigate.’ Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters More\n\nFacebook has suspended the Canadian data firm with which the official Vote Leave campaign spent 40% of its budget, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal continues to unfold.",
  "Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images More\n\nTen days ago, Wylie gave evidence about AIQ to British MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee and also handed over legal documents that showed the connections between it and SCL Elections, including two contracts and an IP licence as well as an email between Jeff Silvester, the cofounder of AIQ, and Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.",
  "“Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities.”\n\nThe company played a critical role in Britain’s European Union referendum, with a total of £3.5m being spent on its services by four different campaigns: Vote Leave, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.",
  "The company is already intertwined in an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which in November reopened an investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave had given its youth campaign, BeLeave, saying there were “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”.",
  "It is perfectly legal for one campaign to donate to another if they are separate, but the donation went straight from Vote Leave to AIQ, and a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, a 22-year-old volunteer with BeLeave, told the Observer they had no control over how the money was spent.",
  "In its statement, Facebook said: “In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate.",
  "Two weeks ago, Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told how he had helped set up the company when he asked friends in his home town of Victoria, British Columbia, to come and work with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Last week, AIQ told the Observer it was not a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica, and that it had not been involved the exploitation of Facebook data.",
  "On Friday, Facebook announced it had suspended AggregateIQ (AIQ) from its platform following reports the company may be connected to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL.",
  "We couldn’t have done it without them.”\n\nWhistleblower Christopher Wylie has shed light on the alleged links between AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Additionally, it did work for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump, and the US senators Thom Tillis and Ted Cruz.",
  "The email, about the campaign for Bolton, referenced Aleksandr Kogan and the Facebook data he had harvested on behalf of Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant to electoral law.",
  "Previously, it had said: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ.",
  "At that time, AIQ removed a quote from Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s chief strategist, from the home page of its website.",
  "When the commission first looked at this in March 2017 it agreed with Vote Leave.",
  "The Observer first revealed links between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ last May.",
  "AIQ has denied Wylie had any involvement in setting up the company.",
