  "According to the Treasury, Exxon's defense was that the company believed the sanctions established a \"distinction between Sechin's 'professional' and 'personal' capacity,\" but the department insists that \"no materials issued by the White House or the Department of the Treasury asserted an exception or carve-out for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons.\"",
  "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a joint news conference with Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Doha Thomson Reuters The Treasury Department has fined the oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil $2 million for violating US sanctions on Russia — and the violations occurred while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was CEO of the company.",
  "T he Treasury said that Exxon violated the sanctions between May 14 and May 23, 2014 \"by signing eight legal documents related to oil and gas projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, the President of Rosneft OAO, and an individual identified on OFAC's [Office of Foreign Asset Control] List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.\"",
  "\"ExxonMobil followed the clear guidance from the White House and Treasury Department when its representatives signed documents involving ongoing oil and gas activities in Russia with Rosneft — a non-blocked entity — that were countersigned on behalf of Rosneft by CEO Igor Sechin in his official representative capacity,\" the company said.",
  "Tillerson's close relationship with Russia and Putin has previously led to speculation that as secretary of state he could push for sanctions on Russia to be lifted — allowing Exxon's Arctic agreement with Rosneft, reported to be worth $500 billion, to proceed.",
  "Regarding the Black Sea region, the Journal also reported that Exxon \"needs\" a discovery of oil in the area by the end of the year in order to receive a license from the Russian government to drill under the terms of the Rosneft deal, according to the Journal.",
  "This proved to be problematic for both parties: Rosneft does not have the technological ability to drill in cold offshore conditions by itself, while Russia was Exxon's second-biggest exploration area at the time.",
  "The department added that Exxon \"caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\" of Sechin, who is \"contributing to the crisis in Ukraine.\"",

  "The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Exxon had applied to the Treasury Department for a waiver from sanctions on Russia in an effort to restart its joint venture with Rosneft.",
  "Exxon said in a statement that \"OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair\" because it is \"trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation\" of the initial executive order.",
  "Exxon and Rosneft signed a landmark deal in 2012 under Tillerson's leadership to explore Russia's arctic and its portion of the Black Sea, as well as drill in Siberia.",
  "A \"person familiar with the matter\" told the Journal that Exxon has been seeking permission from the US to drill in areas affected by sanctions since late 2015.",
  "\"OFAC determined that ExxonMobil did not voluntarily self-disclose the violations,\" the Treasury said, \"and that the violations constitute an egregious case.\"",
  "Some of the sanctions leveled on Russia include the prohibition of technology transfers in Russian energy projects in the Arctic, Siberia, and the Black Sea.",
  "Back in September 2014, Rosneft discovered oil there with Exxon; however, due to the sanctions, they could not continue the landmark joint exploration.",
  "A \"person briefed with the company's waiver application\" said that \"Exxon is worried it could get boxed out of the Black Sea by the Italians.\"",
  "It is unclear whether the waiver request to the Treasury Department came before or after Tillerson joined the administration.",
  "But Tillerson has close personal ties with Russia and has struck several major deals with Rosneft in the past.",
