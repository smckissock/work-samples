  "“Time is not on the side of integration but of regression” — Josef Janning, ECFR\n\nA combination of economic weakness and the widespread impression that Brussels and/or Berlin are to blame for national ills has eroded confidence in the bloc, fueling populist movements from Spain to Sweden.",
  "Recognizing that countries like Poland and Hungary wouldn’t back down, the German leader focused the talks on areas of common ground, in particular how to improve security with more intelligence sharing, securing the EU’s borders and preserving the bloc’s refugee pact with Turkey.",
  "While Berlin wants to safeguard the massive investments German companies such as Siemens and BMW have made in the U.K., Eastern European states like Poland and Romania want to protect the status of their citizens there and the remittances they send home.",
  "If Merkel has spent most of her time in office putting out fires across the Continent, from the financial crisis and Greece to the refugee influx, her next and likely final term would focus on a subject close to any longtime leader’s heart — legacy.",
  "“Time is not on the side of integration but of regression.”\n\nThat Merkel recognizes she has a limited time frame for action was evident last week when she met 15 national European leaders in an effort to begin building consensus in key areas.",
  "While Berlin believes Europe has made strides in improving its regulatory framework and preparing for shocks like the debt crisis, Merkel’s camp also acknowledges that much more needs to be done to restore trust in the EU.",
  "The shuttle diplomacy, which took the chancellor from the deck of an Italian aircraft carrier to Tallinn and points between, was partly a confidence building exercise ahead of this month’s informal summit in Bratislava.",
  "Though few seriously doubt Merkel wants a chance at an era-crowning fourth term as Kanzlerin, behind-the-scenes squabbling in her conservative alliance over the timing of an announcement has fed theories of a Plan B.",
  "While even her critics say she is the only leader with the stature to tackle the bloc’s catalog of ills, they also complain that Germany’s political and economic dominance is at the root of many of the EU’s problems.",
  "In addition to the loss of economic muscle in both France and Italy in recent years, Merkel’s position in key areas, in particular economic and fiscal policy, is often far removed from those in Paris and Rome.",
  "BERLIN — Berlin’s government quarter was hot with speculation this week about the “K-Frage,” a long-running political parlor game over whether Angela Merkel will pursue another run for Germany’s chancellery.",
  "Even as her allies and adversaries parse her public statements and body language for clues of her plans, Merkel has quietly begun laying the groundwork for another four-year term, her political allies say.",
  "Like Germany, Eastern European countries have little interest in pursuing a punitive approach with the U.K. during the Brexit talks and reject calls from France and other western countries for a hard line.",
  "“Merkel’s aim here was to repair Berlin’s ties with Eastern Europe that have been strained by the refugee crisis,\" said Joerg Forbrig, an analyst with the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. in Berlin.",
  "For the German leader, the Bratislava summit marks the start of what promises to the arduous task of restoring confidence in an EU plagued by weak leadership and competing national agendas.",
  "\"That’s important for the atmosphere within the EU.”\n\nWith the U.K. essentially out of the EU decision-making process, she will try to build broader coalitions on important questions.",
  "Merkel’s diplomatic offensive was also a sign that with the U.K. essentially out of the EU decision-making process, she will try to build broader coalitions on important questions.",
  "“In Berlin people realize it’s important to seize the moment because it may not come back,” said Josef Janning, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.",
  "That fear has strengthened the various regional blocs within the EU, such as Scandanavia, the Baltics or the so-called Visegrád group of Central European states.",
  "For Merkel, meetings between the three are as much as about reining in French and Italian hopes for freer spending as they are about setting the EU’s agenda.",
  "If the EU continues to unravel in the coming years, Merkel, the Continent’s preeminent political figure, will be remembered as the leader who lost Europe.",
  "She no longer believes Germany and France, even together with Italy which has joined their recent meetings, can act as a motor for the EU, analysts say.",
  "Wild ones\n\nA common complaint among Europe’s smaller members is that large countries, led by Berlin, bigfoot them in the EU decision-making process.",
  "In Germany, Merkel’s swing through Eastern Europe was widely seen as a failure because she didn't convince countries to accept any refugees.",
  "Indeed, it was a common rejection of Merkel’s refugee policy that led to the often-fractious Visegrad group’s recent renaissance.",
  "Securing that place in history will depend in large part on whether Merkel succeeds in putting Europe on steadier ground.",
  "Even with the clock ticking, Merkel — ever the physicist — insists Europe study the problem before taking action.",
  "“What we need to do is take stock of where we are,” she said this week in an interview the German television.",
  "“She’s not trying to win them over to her course but trying to prevent them from running wild,” Janning said.",
  "A familiar question is already dominating those deliberations: How to fix Europe?",
  "“Instead of rushing into action, one should calmly deliberate.\"",
  "Brexit, they say, could be the catalyst to turn the tide.",
  "Another area of agreement: Brexit.",
  "Yet that was never her plan.",
  "Her message: Berlin listens."
