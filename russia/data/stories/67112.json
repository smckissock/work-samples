  "The Trump administration, his sources say, wanted to hit the ground running by striking a world-shaking, script-flipping deal with the Russians in which economic sanctions would be dropped in exchange for the establishment of close Russia-U.S. cooperation to crush ISIS in Syria:\n\nTom Malinowski, who had just stepped down as President Obama’s assistant secretary of state for human rights, told Yahoo News he too joined the effort to lobby Congress after learning from former colleagues that the administration was developing a plan to lift sanctions — and possibly arrange a summit between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin — as part of an effort to achieve a “grand bargain” with Moscow.",
  "It makes even more sense when you consider that Michael Flynn had done business in Russia after being fired from his previous job for failing to get along with with other figures in U.S. intelligence—and that Jared Kushner fancies himself a visionary entrepreneur who’s bringing the profit-motivated, move-fast-and-break-things ethos of the private sector to government.",
  "Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the tradition of the Clintonometer and the Trump Apocalypse Watch, the Impeach-O-Meter is a wildly subjective and speculative daily estimate of the likelihood that Donald Trump leaves office before his term ends, whether by being impeached (and convicted) or by resigning under threat of same.",
  "If Trump officials had waited until inauguration on Jan. 20, they could have had as many secure conversations with Russian figures as they wanted to, and all without creating the impression that they were trying to undermine the Obama administration when it was still in office.",
  "Unfortunately for the pair, it is a “bad look” for Americans to conduct secret conversations which undermine the sitting American president’s policy toward hostile countries, and it also turns out that there are practical reasons why Russia and the U.S. aren’t close allies.",
  "What better cause for both of them than to blow minds on Day 1 of the Trump administration by #disrupting geopolitics and launching an alliance with Flynn’s pals in Russia—a country whose leaders love to move fast and break things in the service of making big money?",
  "“It would have been a win-win for Moscow,” said Malinowski, who only days before he left office announced his own round of sanctions against senior Russian officials for human rights abuses under a law known as the Magnitsky Act.",
  "When news broke that Jared Kushner had allegedly asked the Russian ambassador to the U.S. to help the Trump transition team set up a secret, secure backchannel to the Kremlin in December, the biggest question was: Why?",
  "One answer that’s theoretically possible is that the secret calls involved illegal activity—discussion of collusion between Russian hackers and the Trump campaign, or the arrangement of corrupt business quid pro quos.",
  "Of course, Kushner and Flynn would know that such a move would upset and annoy the stodgy U.S. national security establishment, hence the need for secrecy.",
  "The same question pertains to Michael Flynn’s choice to conduct a controversial call about economic sanctions with the same ambassador later in the month.",
  "But while those are fun theories, there’s still no public evidence to support them.",
  "So the plan—if this was, in fact, their plan—was probably doomed from the start.",
  "Anyway, since this is all just speculation, our likelihood stays at 35 percent.",
  "A new story by Michael Isikoff at Yahoo suggests another potential explanation.",
  "Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner at the White House on Feb. 13.",
  "Why not just wait?"
