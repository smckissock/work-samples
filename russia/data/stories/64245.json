  "Cotton gave a speech on criminal justice Thursday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. During his remarks, he argued that policy goals like reducing mandatory minimum sentences, restoring voting rights for felons and reducing barriers to employment for ex-offenders are misguided and \"dangerous.\"",
  "\"The claim that too many criminals are being jailed, that there is over-incarceration, ignores an unfortunate fact: For the vast majority of crimes, a perpetrator is never identified or arrested, let alone prosecuted, convicted and jailed,\" Cotton said.",
  "According to the latest rankings from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, the United States has the largest prison population in the world and the second highest incarceration rate, trailing only Seychelles.",

  "He's heavily lobbied his colleagues to oppose the legislation, repeatedly claiming that its passage would lead to the release of thousands of violent criminals.",
  "\"Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes.",
  "Cotton specifically criticized a bill under consideration in the Senate that would reform federal sentencing laws for nonviolent crimes.",
  "(Experts argue that Seychelles, an island country with about 90,000 citizens, is an outlier due to its small population size.)",
  "\"The truth is you cannot decrease the severity and certainty of sentences without increasing crime,\" Cotton said.",
  "Meanwhile, 18 states plus the federal prison system were over capacity at the end of 2014.",
  "In Illinois, prisons had 20,000 more inmates than the facilities were designed to hold.",
  "Thursday's speech marked Cotton's latest move against the Senate reform bill.",
