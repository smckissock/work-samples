  "Private security entrepreneur Erik Prince, who headed the military contractor formerly known as Blackwater and is the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, arranged a Trump Tower meeting in August 2016 bringing together an Israeli specialist in social-media manipulation, an emissary for Saudi and United Arab Emirates crown princes, and Donald Trump Jr., according to a Saturday report from the New York Times.",
  "The emissary, George Nader, according to the Times, told the then-candidate's son that they were interesting in helping his father win the presidential election that November, while the social-media expert, named by the Times as Joel Zamel, apparently pitched his company's plan to manipulate social media in service of the Trump campaign.",
  "Zamel, according to the report, was paid as much as $2 million by Nader -- who has been reported to be cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 campaign -- after the U.S. presidential election.",
  "Nader, it said, went on to meet frequently with Jared Kushner, the now-president's son-in-law, and with Trump ally and eventual national-security adviser Michael Flynn.",
  "The Times cited an unnamed person characterized as possessing knowledge of the meeting as saying Trump Jr. responded positively.",
  "The Times said it was unclear whether such a social-media plan was carried out.",
