  "“We shall discuss the issue of Russia’s mirror-like response to discrimination of Russian media in the United States, including the possibility of a ban for accreditation of US media which will be declared foreign agents by the Russian Justice Ministry, in the Federation Council and the State Duma, at the commission’s session on December 13,” a senior Russian lawmaker declared.",
  "The Russian media law is specifically intended as retaliation against the U.S. Justice Department’s new reporting requirements for Russia Today (also known as RT.com), the state-run media organization charged with attempting to interfere in the U.S. presidential election.",
  "A key difference between the U.S. action against RT.com and Russia’s retaliatory legislation is that Russia’s restrictions can potentially apply to any media organization, not just those which demonstrably receive support and direction from a foreign government.",

  "Putin evidently overcame these misgivings to order his Justice Ministry to begin treating some media outlets as foreign agents on November 25.",
  "At least nine American media outlets, including Voice of America and Radio Liberty, could be required to register as foreign agents by Russia.",
  "The DOJ action relied upon the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which was originally drafted to deal with Nazi propaganda in World War 2.",

  "International news organizations have expressed concerns the practice could be broadened to include them as well.",
  "The Russian parliament approved legislation to require such registration in mid-November."
