  "Like many traditional retailers with a heavy presence in shopping malls, Macy's has struggled to attract shoppers as online retailers like Amazon and discount chains such as T.J.Maxx gain market share.",

  "During the fourth quarter, Macy's recorded $166 million in pre-tax costs associated with its latest round of layoffs and $38 million in write-offs for store closures.",
