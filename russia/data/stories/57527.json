  "What I hear from the people who work for Trump, \"He's a difficult client.\"",
  "But watch to see if Congress doesn't exercise its authority to declassify.",
  "HODGE: Well, they -- states are certainly allowed to create a payroll tax.",
  "And so it would actually increase the tax burden on working New Yorkers.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGIGOT: Scott Hodge is president of the Tax Foundation.",
  "FINLEY: I think she has brand name recognition on par with Donald Trump.",
  "So they're going to be putting a lot of pressure on him not to go there.",
  "Look, this is going to be one of the real tests of whether it gets done.",
  "And I think they understand that the North Korea is a major factor here.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGIGOT: Time now for our \"Hits & Misses\" of the week.",
  "I don't underestimate the problems, but he's got now 120 days to do it.",
  "HENNINGER: The president's insisting that a wall of some sort be built.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nHODGE: It really levels the playing field, which is great.",
  "So in some ways, I think the more interesting story is what came after.",
  "And in this election, this is something that he has to take seriously.",
  "He's talking about the proposal made by the Senate Democrats, Allysia.",
  "Bill, let's step back after a week of reporting about this Wolff book.",
  "But how do you reform a coalition if you're Trump to make that happen?",
  "The Trump administration keeping the Iran nuclear deal intact for now.",
  "OK, let's say they cut a deal with us, then Iran says, no, all right?",
  "We'll tell you what the people around the president really say, next.",
  "I mean, every state faces --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHODGE: It equalizes, yes.",
  "And their European companies have it on license from American firms.",
  "FINLEY: When they were four or five, and they don't have any family.",
  "One is the alternative minimum tax, which was created by Democrats.",
  "GIGOT: But on the other hand, Kim, I mean, Allysia's point is good.",
  "That raises the largest question, the Democratic Party's identity.",
  "GIGOT: He's the new chief of staff who came after that six months.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nGIGOT: Because they came when they were four or five.",
  "This should be a bill of love, truly, it should be a bill of love.",
  "HENNINGER: I'm going to give a hit to the tax reform bill of 2017.",
  "They can no longer shift a lot of their burden off to Washington.",
  "What do you to do on single-payer health care or climate change?",
  "And honestly, our European friends have to wake up to that, too.",
  "And whatever technology they have, Iran could have the next day.",
  "AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Glad to be here.",

  "PAUL GIGOT, HOST: Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report.\"",
  "He did it because it was in our strategic interest to do it.",
  "This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.",
  "And I think Kim is right, there's a basis here for a deal.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nThese were, of course, terrible earmark ideas.",
  "They'd be happy to pin us with withdrawing from the deal.",
  "GIGOT: So the simple solution here is cut your tax rates.",
  "But the madness of King Donald, what do you make of that?",
  "And so they are probably going to start attacking Oprah.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Oprah would be a lot of fun.",
  "GIGOT: What are we going to learn from these documents?",
  "And was it used knowing the information was unverified?",
  "HENNINGER: It's a fantasy, it's ludicrous, it's absurd.",
  "Donald J. Trump, the J. stands for Jeb, as in Jeb Bush.",
  "FINLEY: I think this is a big political winner for him.",
  "Iran is part of the deal, and they have to agree to it.",
  "I'm more interested to know is it true or is it false.",
  "What did -- what's the biggest takeaway that you have?",
  "Her last week, and she had Donald Trump and my family.",
  "STRASSEL: -- which could come out and dog her as well.",
  "She's somebody that says can't we all just get along?",
  "Allysia, I love the look on Dick Durbin's face there.",
  "It's really a scheme, a tax payment by any other way.",
  "SCOTT HODGE, PRESIDENT, TAX FOUNDATION: Thanks, Paul.",
  "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Amnesty, amnesty.",
  "So let's think through the responses they're making.",
  "GIGOT: That's what he said in the August transcript.",
  "And, look, by the way, he had to issue a correction.",
  "GIGOT: That is the political process for doing that.",
  "But it reflects a time in the Trump administration.",
  "He's volatile, he's impulsive, he changes his mind.",
  "And throws the negotiations somewhat up in the air.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, in a way this is not unusual.",
  "But it shows the fever to get rid of Donald Trump.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We'll see what happens.",
  "HENNINGER: Yes, I think you put your finger on it.",
  "So could the talk show host out- Trump the Donald?",
  "I think we have a kind of survival of the fittest.",
  "Bernie Sanders' wife has got some legal problems.",
  "That's going to be politically difficult as well.",
  "Look, you can agree or disagree with all of that.",
  "What do we think the fallout ultimately has been?",
  "GIGOT: They want to use it as a political issue.",
  "The alternative policy is regime change in Iran.",
  "So you think this is a smart play by Trump then?",
  "Trump has to emphasize that and explain it more.",
  "They weren't clear whether LBJ was alive or not.",
  "So there's no discrimination at the federal law.",
  "What are we likely -- this is important, right?",
  "It'd actually be easier to negotiate with Iran.",
  "When we come back, \"Hits & Misses\" of the week.",
  "DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes.",
  "Technically, I'd be happy to argue that point.",
  "STRASSEL: If that were true, it would be huge.",
  "I think it's a stalking horse for impeachment.",
  "GIGOT: OK. Scott Hodge, thanks for being here.",
  "She's not a risk- free candidate in that way.",
  "They are going to have to control themselves.",
  "FINLEY: This is a hit to American innovation.",
  "First, the Arizona Power Service in Arizona.",
  "GIGOT: And she'd be in a big field, Allysia.",
  "And there is something in this for everyone.",
  "So is a deal with Democrats still possible?",
  "There's a sort of good feeling about Oprah.",
  "And they are going to have to get in line.",
  "That was also created by an Ohio Democrat.",
  "HENNINGER: Done deal if they take it back.",
  "He came out, and he got everybody excited.",
  "Republicans worried about the FBI motives.",
  "BOLTON: Sounds like a red line to me, too.",
  "That, in effect, is what he served today.",
  "So this threat is becoming more imminent.",
  "GIGOT: And Trump said I'll take the heat.",
  "So I think we need to know these answers.",
  "I mean, certainly, I'll see what happens.",
  "That's a very difficult person to advise.",
  "That's a quote I've heard more than once.",
  "I think it'd be thrown out by the courts.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: I know her very well.",
  "But will their strategies actually work?",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nGIGOT: That's what he said.",
  "STRASSEL: Yes, in the August transcript.",
  "HENNINGER: That is in the Constitution.",
  "It's a state law which they can change.",
  "I think this is really thrashing about.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nHENNINGER: And a proud one.",
  "How is this going to complicate things?",
  "That's what's known as border security.",
  "The people rose at the end of December.",
  "Believe me, they're not going to do it.",
  "She could rise above all the animosity.",
  "You know, I did one of her last shows.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nGIGOT: The 2018 election.",
  "Do you think that's likely to happen?",
  "So that would be one of the measures.",
  "And they go about -- what do they do?",
  "Why should they change the agreement?",
  "Hope to see you right here next week.",
  "What would you -- what do you think?",
  "You think that's the way they'll go?",
  "GIGOT: And would the IRS approve it?",
  "We talked about this 25th Amendment.",
  "We should get back to real politics.",
  "GIGOT: That is in the Constitution.",
  "GIGOT: Let's take those one by one.",
  "GIGOT: Right, at the federal level.",
  "Who else, who else is going to run?",
  "They'll use this to -- as a cudgel.",
  "The payoffs just keep coming, Paul.",
  "And we now have an answer to that.",
  "There's a small complication here.",
  "That sounds like a red line to me.",
  "It may, indeed, be misinformation.",
  "Isn't that, basically, a fantasy?",
  "I've got a car for you, you know?",
  "I don't think she's going to run.",
  "Bernie happens to be a Socialist.",
  "I would argue he's now committed.",
  "They want a modification of that.",
  "But let's get to this expletive.",
  "So much centers on Steve Bannon.",
  "GIGOT: All right, thank you all.",
  "And nobody should doubt my word.",
  "How do you see that playing out?",
  "It's pointless to talk about it.",
  "GIGOT: All right, thank you all.",
  "So they have the documents now.",
  "But will their strategies work?",
  "McMaster have their hands full.",
  "That's it for this week's show.",
  "We have to take one more break.",
  "And thanks to you for watching.",
  "MCGURN: Paul, a hit to Costco.",
  "And maybe we can do something.",
  "Do the deal and take the heat.",
  "So that probably wouldn't fly.",
  "That's very, very challenging.",
  "That is -- she's not divisive.",
  "She's likable, she's popular.",
  "HODGE: It's probably illegal.",
  "How did the FBI present this?",
  "This -- Dan, let's step back.",
  "The betrayal caucus came out.",
  "Well, OK, then take the heat.",
  "This is a humanitarian issue.",
  "I suppose this is inevitable.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nGIGOT: OK.\n\nDan?",
  "It just depends how quickly.",
  "I think this regime is weak.",
  "GIGOT: All right, thank you.",
  "Does this make sense to you?",
  "The difference is state law.",
  "That's what's so troubling.",
  "What does the president do?",
  "That's not why we like her.",
  "BOLTON: -- or Israel does.",
  "But that's what they want.",
  "I wouldn't discount Oprah.",
  "Our panel weighs in, next.",
  "This was before politics.",
  "What to you make of that?",
  "I think that's the point.",
  "JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S.",
  "BOLTON: Thank you, Paul.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV.",
  "HENNINGER: In the House.",
  "And this clearly would.",
  "GIGOT: And a proud one.",
  "Widespread across Iran.",
  "Thank you, John Bolton.",
  "Rex Tillerson and H.R.",
  "It's called elections.",
  "MCGURN: Right, right.",
  "She had Donald Trump.",
  "I know her very well.",
  "That protest is over.",
  "Ambassador, welcome.",
  "He's not a Democrat.",
  "Welcome back, Scott.",
  "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",
  "All right, Allysia?",
  "Thanks to my panel.",
  "And we can do this.",
  "It died yesterday.",
  "This clearly does.",
  "Extremely popular.",
  "MCGURN: Yes, 2018.",
  "That's unheard of.",
  "GIGOT: Hear, hear.",
  "Kim, start us off.",
  "GIGOT: All right.",
  "GIGOT: All right.",
  "GIGOT: All right.",
  "It was very nice.",
  "No, I like Oprah.",
  "GIGOT: All right.",
  "I agree with you.",
  "This is betrayal.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes.",
  "Don't you think?",
  "Good to see you.",
  "It's ridiculous.",
