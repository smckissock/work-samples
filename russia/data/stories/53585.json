  "I decided to take the meeting.”\n\nGiven the avalanche of increasingly incriminating revelations about this meeting — including that it involved not only Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya but also campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and a former Soviet counterintelligence officer named Rinat Akhmetshin — some details were buried in the mix.",
  "“Don Jr.’s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign,” a statement from his attorney read, “and it was coming from someone he knew.”\n\nOn July 11, Trump Jr. released copies of the emails in an effort to get ahead of another Times story that was about to drop.",
  "“The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.",
  "This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and it’s government’s support for Mr. Trump — helped along by Aras and Emin.”\n\nTrump Jr., perhaps a bit skeptical, suggests a phone call with Emin the following week before agreeing.",
  "One of Goldstone’s clients was a performer named Emin Agalarov, who is also the vice president of a development company in Moscow that partnered with the Trump Organization in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant in that city.",
  "Somehow, between the time when Goldstone and Trump Jr. were trying to set up a call with Agalarov and this email, Agalarov has asked to schedule a meeting with Trump Jr. and Trump Jr. has become aware of that meeting.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017\n\nIn March, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, even told the New York Times that he had never participated in any meetings with Russians related to the campaign.",
  "On July 10, the Times revealed that this wasn’t the whole truth: Trump Jr. had been told in an email that the information being offered was part of an effort by the Russian government to ensure Trump’s election.",
  "“We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government,” he explained in a statement.",
  "“Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday,” Goldstone writes the next day, not using Veselnitskaya’s name (as Trump Jr.",
  "We know that perhaps the only record of the phone calls with Agalarov that might exist are records of the calls’ duration, which Trump Jr. has now included in his statement before those records are subpoenaed.",
  "I simply do not remember.”\n\nAn attorney for Agalarov, speaking to The Post, echoed that formulation, saying that his client had “absolutely no memory” of talking to Trump Jr.\n\nThat’s a lot of context.",
  "We know that Trump Jr. has proven to be consistently uninterested in offering a full explanation of the events surrounding that meeting until it has become unavoidable for him to do so.",
  "On July 7 of this year, the official line from President Trump and his allies was that there had been no collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian interests.",
  "(Although Agalarov, as a Russian national, certainly may have had his communications surveilled by American intelligence agencies; hence the “perhaps” in the paragraph above.)",
  "Trump Jr. suggested in a statement that he was told by “an acquaintance” that an individual “might have information helpful to the campaign,” but he wasn’t told her name.",
  "“I believe you are aware of the meeting – and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you?”\n\nThere’s no other communication between Goldstone and Trump Jr.",
  "In the end, it wasn’t about that at all.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump Jr. presented testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the meeting and what led up to it.",
  "On July 9, the Times revealed that this wasn’t true: Trump Jr. had agreed to the meeting after being promised information that was damaging to Hillary Clinton.",
  "On July 8, the Times revealed that this wasn’t true: Trump Jr. had met with a Russian attorney named Natalia Veselnitskaya who had links to the Kremlin.",
  "That Trump Jr.’s understanding of what information was being presented may indeed have included a phone conversation with a person close to the source.",
  "His statement upon doing so read, in part: “The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research.",
  "Several days later, Goldstone tries to set that up, working to connect Trump Jr. and Agalarov while the latter is performing a concert in Moscow.",
  "During the meeting, though, “it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information,” and Veselnitskaya then changed topics to adoption.",
  "Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.",
  "I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet.",
  "Trump Jr. didn’t want people to know about the meeting or, then, the contents of the meeting or, then, the origin of the meeting.",
  "If they did, that call almost certainly involved Agalarov explaining to Trump Jr. why the meeting was worth his time.",
  "“My phone records show three very short phone calls between Emin and me between June 6th and 7th,” he said.",

  "Why would we think he’s being forthright about a possible conversation with Agalarov?",
  "Goldstone’s emails to Trump Jr. on the subject mentioned Agalarov at the outset.",
  "“As I recall, it was all basically this email coordination,” Trump Jr. replied.",
  "We know that Trump Jr. only agreed to the meeting after those calls occurred.",
  "And why would we then think that he was being forthright about what was said?",
  "The evidence at hand strongly suggests that Agalarov and Trump Jr. spoke.",
  "Agalarov, to some extent, sold the president’s son on taking the meeting.",
  "What Goldstone seemed to be implying you would receive,” Hannity asks.",
