  "Putin is annexing Crimea; he's intervening in Ukraine, that is followed very quickly by sanctions imposed by the United States - by the Obama Administration and the European union, and as we document in the book, this is what leads to the collapse of the project, one of the entities that was going to finance the project, Sberbank, a majority Russian government-owned financial institution was targeted in those sanctions.",
  "SMERCONISH: So the President has filed through a new lawyer, same\n\n\n\nlawyer who took down Gawker, by the way, on behalf of Hulk Hogan, a joinder of defendant of Donald J. Trump in notice of removal of action by defendant essential consultants, here's what I think is going on, he is trying to get the federal court involved so as to make sure this case stays in arbitration.",
  "[09:15:00] Michael, one of the many takeaways as I read your book thus far is that there is this recurring cast of characters, Russia nationals, who have been around President Trump not just recently in the context of the campaign, I'm thinking of the folks at the Trump Tower meeting or meetings, but going back three decades.",
  "But what is significant and what I think helps explain Mueller's subpoena for these Trump organization records is you take a look at that notorious Trump Tower meeting, the one where the Trump campaign is offered derogatory information in the form of official sensitive documents from the Russian government.",
  "[09:30:00]\n\n\n\nAnd now in his article, Silicon Valley's tax-avoiding, job-killing, soul-sucking machine, Scott Galloway, writes that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have an impact on our daily lives unlike any companies in human history and his provocative conclusion is, yes, big tech must be busted up.",
  "If in fact it occurred the way the Inspector General says it took place, which Mr. McCabe I understand disputes, but insofar as he, a, authorized members of the FBI to speak to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" then, b, if he were untruthful about it under oath, for which of those does he face more exposure?",
  "They're are about 40% of all online sales; they're about 25% of all retail growth in the U.S.; they have 70% share of voice, and get this, they have Prime or they have video distribution recurring revenue relationship with 80% of wealthy households and two-thirds of all households in the U.S.",
  "SMERCONISH: As I read the book, I said to myself, I'm very dubious of the idea that that infamous meeting that could have take place at the Trump Tower, and you talk about a second meeting, but that that infamous meeting could have taken place without the now President having been notified.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:40:00]\n\n\n\nSMERCONISH: Friday attorneys defending President Donald Trump filed to move the lawsuit against him by adult film actress Stormy Daniels to federal court and are claiming that she could owe as much as $20 million for violating a non-disclosure agreement.",
  "We have this crazy operation here where I'm in front of a camera in Philly, and my producer, T.C., is out in the burbs, and she's screening them madly and sending them to New York, and then New York sends them to Atlanta, all so that I can respond in real time to whatever is on your mind.",
  "On the other hand, I should point out that if for example she has to say something about his penis size in a way -- and I'm sorry early in the morning to talk about this, but in a way he's opened the door to that because he's bragged about it as I recall in the debate with Marco Rubio.",
  "Well then again, as I say, this is \"A Tale of Two Cities\" to those supportive of the President and conservative, this is a day of celebration; and to those on the left, who see it as being part and parcel of a cover up, of obstruction of justice, they see it entirely different.",
  "CVS said it would buy Aetna; Disney said that it would buy Fox; Cigna sought to buy Express Scripts; but, there's been no Justice Department opposition to any of those deals, which begs the question of whether opposition to the AT&T-Time Warner deal is politically motivated.",
  "Consider that Amazon, with a market cap of $591 billion, is worth more to the stock market than Walmart, Costco, T.J. Maxx, Target, Ross, Best Buy, Ulta, Khol's, Nordstrom, Macy's, Bed Bath and Beyond, Sachs, Lord and Taylor, Dillard's, J. C. Penney, and Sears combined.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSMERCONISH: Russia has expelled 23 British diplomats after being blamed for the recent nerve gas poisoning of a former spy in the U.K. just the latest bizarre turn in a week where the Russian meddle in our election continued to dominate headlines.",
  "And the First Amendment says you can't do that and the Supreme Court in the Pentagon Papers case of course said that you can only do it, maybe, if the publication would result surely in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to the nation or its people.",
  "If CNN had been weaponized by Russia, Michael, my sense is we would have fined your network or advertisers would have run from it, but advertisers can't run from Facebook because two thirds of all digital marketing is controlled by one of two companies.",
  "The amount of power these companies can achieve, the low cost of capital, the scale, their ability to put small companies out of business and as I said, put big companies out of business probably prematurely is having a real impact on our economy.",
  "What will be interesting to see is whether he can stay sufficiently removed from that underlying agreement insofar as maybe he says hey, Michael Cohen negotiated that, I guess, I had nothing to do with it, but it is a valid agreement nonetheless.",
  "In a moment an NYU Professor whose students get recruited by these giants, despite his personal view that, quote, these behemoths enjoy unfettered economic domination and hoard riches on a scale not seen since the monopolies of the gilded age.",
  "Because he knew the personalities in that room and it just sort of, it's strange credulity to think that Don, Jr. or Jared Kushner, or Manafort, or someone wouldn't have said hey, we just had this meeting or we're about to have this meeting.",
  "JONATHAN TURLEY, LAWYER, LEGAL SCHOLAR, WRITER, AND LEGAL ANALYST: Well, what is justified in the sense that these were career officials at the office on of professional responsibility that made this recommendation which is exceedingly rare.",
  "But my hunch is we all so love the gadgetry, you know, as he says, looking at his iPhone, that while maybe we think economically speaking, they have too much power, uh-oh, I hope it's not going to jeopardize my ability to do a Google search.",
  "And we're so impressed with these kids and we read every day in old media about how awesome innovation is, but we don't talk about the reality that that there are about half as many businesses being formed today as there were 40 years ago.",
  "So it came close then, but then he tries again through another associate, a former felon named Felix Sater, and they set up another deal for -- and a letter of intent once again is signed for a Trump Tower project in Moscow.",
  "ISIKOFF: Right, and as you point out, we disclose in the book an earlier Trump Tower meeting that took place with Trump himself and Emin Agalarov and Rob Goldstone, the key players in the later meeting that's January 2015.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my Administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.",
  "Attorney Jeff sessions' statement read in part, both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions.",
  "TURLEY: Right, and in fact everyone that I know of speaks highly of Horowitz, that is he is viewed as completely apolitical and this office, as you note, is insulated like a Sherman tank from any type of outside forces.",
  "And think about this, Michael, 92% share of a sector search that now by dollar volume is greater than the entire advertising market of any country with the exception of U.S. and we'll probably blow by it in two years.",
  "For his part, McCabe claimed I'm a statement quote, I'm being singled out and treated this way because of the role that I played, the actions I took, and events I witnessed in the aftermath of firing of James Comey.",
  "Joining me now, Michael Isikoff who is co-author with David Corn of what is the number one best seller in the country, \"Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.\"",
  "You could merge the world's top five advertising agencies with five major media companies and still need to add five major communications companies to get only 90% of what Google and Facebook are worth together.",
  "He is not elected, cannot be removed from office, and last year tried to get his shareholders to agree to a three-class share holder system where he could end up owning none of the company and still control it.",
  "Middle class wages are stagnating, and if you were to look at the rise of big tech and decline in the growth of the wages of the middle class, you would have a difficult time saying there is not a correlation.",
  "The Justice Department argues that the deal would give AT&T the power to charge its competitors more for Time Warner's content, or to block the content entirely from the likes of Comcast, Verizon and Charter.",
  "I do think that they have to be careful, CBS has to be careful in terms of what she says and whether it subjects them to an invasion of privacy suit, not dissimilar from that of Hulk Hogan's against Gawker.",
  "SMERCONISH: And of course McCabe's response to all of this is that this is an effort to discredit him because of testimony he might be able to provide relative to the President and obstruction of justice.",
  "The report said to have found that McCabe misled investigators about his role directing other FBI officials to speak to media about the investigation into the Clinton e-mails and Clinton Foundation.",
  "Facebook has technology that goes out and assesses if an app is getting traction and if it is, it immediately adopts the features into one of its own apps, and if it can't, it goes and it buys it.",
  "So the notion that company needs to - or this merger needs to be restrained and these companies with five or ten times the distribution and content don't need to be broken up, seems irrational.",
  "This failure was certainly one of debt with which the company was saddled by its private equity investors, but of course, the next time you need \"Star Wars\" Legos, you'll probably go to Amazon.",
  "(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:25:00]\n\n\n\nSMERCONISH: Opening statements are scheduled to begin on Wednesday in the Justice Department bid to stop the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner.",
  "ISIKOFF: Well, there is that first Trump Tower project which I've just been talking about with the Agalarovs and I mentioned in February of 2014 Ivanka goes to Moscow to look for properties.",
  "The domination in our lives by big tech is unmistakable, but nobody seems particularly upset about it, certainly not members of Congress who in any other context would be raising questions.",
  "Up next, on Friday President Trump's attorneys filed to move Stormy Daniels' lawsuit against him to federal court and claims she owes $20 million for violating her nondisclosure agreement.",
  "After he left he removed material from the FBI that the FBI material that the FBI has indicated, I think correctly so, that was FBI material, not subject to being removed from the bureau.",
  "So it is perfectly logical and makes sense that Mueller would want to subpoena the records to see everything that the Trump organization has about its relationship with the Agalarovs.",
  "A cnn.com report this week noted that this is the first time in four decades that the Justice Department has sued to block a merger between companies in different lines of business.",
  "SMERCONISH: And as I think you've made clear, we showed that headline from the Friday \"Times\" about Mueller now seeking documents, via subpoena power, from the Trump organization.",
  "Still to come, Trump's lawyers now say adult film actress Stormy Daniels owes him $20 million for violating her NDA, but can they prevent her \"60 Minutes\" interview from airing?",
  "GALLOWAY: Oh, hands down it is Mark Zuckerberg who has as assembled a community more vast than Christianity -- 2.2 billion people -- and has license to take the mood up or down.",
  "Scott Galloway is a Professor at NYU's Stern School of Business, I know when this conversation ends, the tweets will come and people will say who was that socialist you had on.",
  "SMERCONISH: I remember from my days of service in the federal government it was on the watch of Bush 41, Papa Bush, the Inspector General's Office was at an arm's length away.",
  "Amazon has 70% distribution, 70% of homes have Prime video and they're the second largest spender in the world on original scripted content at $5 billion just behind Netflix.",
  "You know, for example, talking about specifics about the sexual act could be viewed as an invasion of privacy notwithstanding it involves the President of the United States.",
  "You'll recall Daniels accepted a $130,000 payment shortly before Election Day 2016 in exchange for her promise to remain silent about the alleged affair which Trump denies.",
  "SMERCONISH: Professor, I pulled a graphic from your work in \"Esquire\" relative to Facebook and Google which says that Facebook and Google are together worth $1.3 trillion.",
  "Nonetheless, I think CBS has to vet the story carefully to be careful and, as you point out, the lawyer he now has is the lawyer who made that privacy suit against Gawker.",
  "If that is the case, you have to wonder why the subpoena would have been issued unless Mueller's people saw indications or signs that not everything was being turned over.",
  "(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nSMERCONISH: But if you want to talk about too much power in the hands of too few, shouldn't we at least be asking about Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google?",
  "Because it seems as we layout in the book, pretty basic to understanding what was going on in that Trump tower meeting and what was likely going on during the campaign.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO) JIMMY KIMMEL, TELEVISION HOST: I'll always remenber Toys \"R\" Us as the store where my children had a complete and total meltdown every time we went there.",
  "If you want to understand that Trump Tower meeting, you have to understand these relationships between Trump, himself personally, and the people who set up the meeting.",
  "One of two things is happening here, either the call to restrain AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner is insane or these companies should have been broken up a decade ago.",
  "So if the Inspector General believes this was a leak to the media, it raises serious questions about Comey's previous testimony and could get him into serious trouble.",
  "GALLOWAY Yes, there's a deeper thing going on here and as a society I believe we know longer worship at the altar of character and kindness, but innovators and money.",
  "Amazon has 70% share of voice, probably the technology of the future, and is responsible for about a quarter of all retail growth and about half of all online sales.",
  "And CBS shouldn't be indemnifying her because then they would look like they are in cahoots and that would hurt them in kind of the claim that we were talking about.",
  "So when you see -- when you connect the dots and you see the personal relationships there, you know, it obviously raises the sort of questions that you just raised.",
  "There was one line in McCabe's statement last night that I immediately flagged because he said that he had authority to do this and he conferred with the director.",
  "Shortly after the announcement President Trump tweeted, Andrew McCabe fired, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI, a great day for democracy.",
  "This is a timely subject where this week brought news that Toys \"R\" Us will shutter or sell all of its stores in the United States and Amazon is partly to blame.",
  "And then rather than taking you to the place that's the point of best information but to another place that they can monetize is an abusing that monopoly power.",
  "Earlier you talked about the President wanting to restrain AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T has 120 million phone subscribers, that's the distribution.",
  "Joining me now is George Freeman the Executive Director of the Media Law Resource Center, he was previously the \"New York Times\" in-house lawyer for 30 years.",
  "Also up ahead the results of the survey question, given the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, is it time to bust up big tech quickly?",
  "The OPR, quite frankly, is not viewed as a particularly aggressive office, so all of that makes this a relatively rare sanction coming from career officers.",
  "Plus Russia continues to meddle in our news cycle, poisoning a former spy in the U.K., infiltrating our power grid, being sanctioned for the election hack.",
  "More importantly, even his\n\n\n\nstatement is going to trigger another round of inquiries as to who actually knew about this and was this a leak to the media.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\n[09:45:00] SMERCONISH: Has anyone offered to pony up the million dollars to protect her and say here, I'm good for it, go tell your story?",
  "Now, the Trump organization has said it was voluntarily cooperating with Trump turning over - with Mueller turning over documents that had been requested.",
  "I thought it was unfair to McCabe if they were going to do this, waiting until you go right up to the line of his pension was, I thought, a bit rough.",
  "ISIKOFF: Right, well like I said before, I think what he is looking for is to understand the relationships between Trump and the key players in this.",
  "And President Trump's lawyers taking new steps to keep adult film actress Stormy Daniels silent saying she owes $ 20 million for violating here NDA.",
  "But there will be some that will argue why would you indict Michael Flynn but an Deputy FBI Director is just worried about his pension, not prison.",
  "They clearly concluded that McCabe misled them, and that he misled them on one of the core issues they were investigating, not a collateral issue.",
  "The implication being that Mueller's inquiry is widening to examine the potential role of foreign money in President Trump's political activities.",
  "There is a claim called tortious interference with contract, but that really isn't apt in this setting and I don't think that would be successful.",
  "Facebook has four of the top five apps in the world and is squaring - it's going squarely on Number Five Snap and is putting it out of business.",
  "SMERCONISH: A final quick thought, the most powerful person in the world according to you, it is not Putin, it's not Trump, who is it and why?",
  "But first, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe late Friday less than two days shy of his retirement.",
  "I want to clear up any misperception in thinking that Jeff Sessions or the President could exert influence over the IG, because they can't.",
  "Number one, if CBS was worried about it, they would have put this interview on tomorrow rather than waiting a week, putting it back a week.",
  "Given the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, do you agree with the professor that it is time to bust up big tech?",
  "So when you see that, you start to understand a bit Trump's strange affinity for Putin and his flattering public comments about Putin.",
  "SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: No, I'm a full-throated capitalist.",
  "We're living in rough times and I'm not sure doing it 24 hours before would materially improve the situation emotionally for McCabe.",
  "The growth of our economy is small business two thirds, and it is never easier to be a billionaire, but harder to be a millionaire.",
  "FREEMAN: No, I think they have to be careful about exposure particularly when it comes to a potential claim of invasion of privacy.",
  "Answer today's survey question, given the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, is it time to bust up big tech?",
  "Plus Special Counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump organization to turn over documents including some related to Russia.",
  "Thank you for presenting that tweet because in contrast to the Facebook, you see the differing ways people are interpreting this.",
  "There was one line that jumped off the page at me, Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by law.",
  "But I mean she's obviously made a marketing decision that the $130,000 is peanuts compared to what she could make going forward.",
  "But secondly and more importantly, the First Amendment directly says you can't do that, it says government can't abridge speech.",
  "So they have to be careful about invading privacy and making sure that what she says about sex as some sort of newsworthy angle.",
  "The poll question right now, given the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, is it time to bust up big tech?",
  "Reality 2018, not going to hurt him politically, but will the red ties get tossed out of the second floor of the White House?",
  "SMERCONISH: Are they monopolies in the conventional sense of the word, are they akin to what Ma Bell was before the breakup?",
  "Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe fired Friday night at 10:00 p.m. A little more than 24 hours shy of his retirement.",
  "America finally announced some sanctions against Russia for the meddle and a Russian threat to our power grid was revealed.",
  "Meet the professor who says that for the good of American business, we have to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.",
  "SMERCONISH: Is the reason that we're not worried that which I said in my commentary which is we love use of the technology?",
  "It is Rob Goldstone, the publicist who sends the e-mails to Donald Trump Jr., but he is acting on behalf of the Agalarovs.",
  "(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nSMERCONISH: But Amazon is just one of the booming big tech companies along with Apple, Facebook and Google.",
  "This stems from an internal review conducted by the Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, which hasn't been made public.",
  "I said when we first heard of the report and the recommendation that I thought it was a given in a he would be fired.",
  "Now the problem there is that James Comey said under oath that he never leaked information and never approved a leak.",
  "Nobody is particularly eager to stand up for a cable stove pipe, but hands off my iPhone or my Amazon Prime account.",
  "But no matter how much we enjoy them, these big four are in danger of thwarting the rest of the country's economy.",
  "But, can they prevent \"60 Minutes\" from airing Anderson Cooper's interview with Daniels that's already been taped?",
  "Aras Agalarov, the billionaire Russian oligarch known as Putin's builder, his son, Emin, the aspiring pop singer.",
  "We learned of a threat to our power plants and Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump organization's financials.",
  "They're welcomed by him there and Trump indicates that - he tells Agalarov about his plans to run for President.",
  "As you know, there is a great deal of background discussion that occurs with reporters from the FBI and the DOJ.",
  "Google has the largest video network in the world called YouTube is pre-installed on 2 billion android devices.",
  "He says that at least ten folks stand there checkbook ready to protect her if in fact she is held accountable.",
  "The public knew nothing about it but Trump, at that very moment, was pursuing another deal/project in Russia.",
  "Comey has already been accused, as you know, of leaking information through a friend at Columbia Law School.",
  "I would be very surprising for Sessions to turn down this type of rare recommendation from the career staff.",
  "So the answer I think is no, the NDA shouldn't really bar CBS from airing this or subject them to liability.",
  "GALLOWAY: So, I would argue yes, but a monopoly in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing or an illegal thing.",
  "GEORGE FREEMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDIA LAW RESOURCE CENTER:\n\n\n\nNo, there's really no way they can.",
  "Don't separate me from my Facebook friends and if God's sake don't interrupt my ability to Google anything.",
  "Keep in mind with Michael Flynn, his meeting with the Russians wasn't in any way illegal or unprecedented.",
  "My response to that individual would be to say the Inspector General's office conducted an investigation.",
  "They said that, a, he informed the media when he shouldn't have and that, b, he was untruthful about it.",
  "So Comey, himself, is not out of the woods on this and McCabe's statement doesn't help his position any.",
  "I mean to your point, not even Bernie Sanders says anything about this as far as I know in the Congress.",
  "Let's see what the next one is, my hunch is, and I don't know they don't tell me the tweets in advance.",
  "[09:05:00] What is going to create an issue going forward is whether there will be a criminal referral.",
  "After all he followed the recommendation of the career staff to recues himself and I think rightly so.",
  "And you know, the only surprise to me, Michael, is why it has taken him so long to issue the subpoena.",
  "MICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY FOR STORMY DANIELS: At least ten individuals in the last three days alone.",
  "Any exposure from a legal standpoint insofar as they put her on the air and she is violating the NDA?",
  "Let's see what people are saying in my social media accounts, twitter and Facebook, what do we have?",
  "Keep tweeting, Facebooking, and remember, you can catch up with us any time on CNNgo and on demand.",
  "SMERCONISH: You think what you offer in this book is an explanation of what Mueller is looking for.",
  "Rob Goldstone is quoted in the book as saying that that is what led to the collapse of the project.",
  "SMERCONISH: Michael, for 30 years now President Trump wanted to build in Moscow, never got it done.",
  "You know on the right today McCabe's firing is being celebrated, on the left it is being condemned.",
  "Now with special counsel Mueller subpoenaing Trump organization files, is something going to give?",
  "I'll ask Michael Isikoff, he is co-author of \"Russia Roulette,\" the number one book in the nation.",
  "It was failing to tell them about sanctions being discussed at the meeting that led to his charge.",
  "Smerconish, isn't the firing of Andrew McCabe more of a threat to all career government employees?",
  "Meanwhile, Anderson Cooper has taped a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Daniels due to air next Sunday.",
  "SMERCONISH: Do you think that CBS has any exposure - everything is a double entendre in this case.",
  "The notion that he has nothing to do with the $130,000 is getting sillier and sillier as go along.",
  "It is abusive monopoly, power, and I would argue a company like Google that has 92% market share.",
  "And Amazon will not rest until every other store is an abandoned warehouse teaming with raccoons.",
  "OK, knock it off, bust up big tech, look at all the choices people have for shopping these days.",
  "Meaning small companies can't get out of the crib and big companies are being euthanized early.",
  "So that goes directly to what Trump and his lawyers are trying to do here which is stop speech.",
  "And Stormy Daniels talking about her sexcapade with President Trump hardly meets that standard.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nGEOFFREY THE GIRAFFE, TOYS R US MASCOT: All you bitches bought toys on Amazon.",
  "I don't know how to say your handle, but I guess I have just proven that that is not the case.",
  "SMERCONISH: Perhaps this will finally be the case where we test that size-of-hand hypothesis.",
  "And then you -- we know these are the people Trump was doing business with in Moscow in 2013.",
  "So I don't see any way that the Trump folks can really stop this interview from being aired.",
  "SMERCONISH: Michael Avenatti who represents Stormy Daniels was here with me last weekend.",
  "Ivanka Trump flies to Moscow to scout potential sites for the project with Emin Agalarov.",
  "Well,\n\n\n\nlook, there is a three decade history of Trump trying to do business in Russia.",
  "But putting that aside, I don't think they can get to CBS because CBS is not part of it.",
  "I'm for the middle size, you know where common prevails and data drives conversations.",
  "I've been an entrepreneur my whole life and have done really well owning these stocks.",
  "Hey Vickie, the last thing I'd want to own today would be a bricks and mortar store.",

  "You'll meet the man who advocates breaking them up like Ma Bell or the railroads.",
  "It is a question of whether Trump is a party because he didn't sign the document.",
  "Wow, you really go way out of your way to support any and everything Trump does.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:50:00] SMERCONISH: So this is going to be interesting.",
  "SMERCONISH: Yes, but it did seem a bit vindictive, 10 p.m. on a\n\n\n\nFriday night.",
  "And this week Toys \"R\" Us became the latest retail giant to shutter its stores.",
  "And I think the key to capitalism is competition, and the markets are failing.",
  "Complete loyalty to Trump and Trump alone or on you will pay the consequences.",
  "And I find all of this, in fact all of these controversies, to be deeply sad.",
  "He needed Putin's approval for the business deal he was trying to accomplish.",
  "Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choir boy.",
  "But, yes, thank you for pointing out, that I am, in fact, a proud capitalist.",
  "[09:55:00] Not only do I not write them, I don't see them until you see them.",

  "Professor, this is one of those issues that evidences our partisan divide.",
  "And I had nothing to do with the Inspector General on a day to day basis.",
  "Michael Flynn was indicted for making a false statement to investigators.",
  "Smerconish, are the tweets you read on air actually composed by yourself?",

  "He's a Constitutional Law Professor at George Washington University.",

  "So to some degree he's opened a door for a lot of this discussion.",
  "FREEMAN: I think it is and I think he's going to be unsuccessful.",
  "We welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world.",
  "Facebook is the most successful thing in the history of mankind.",
