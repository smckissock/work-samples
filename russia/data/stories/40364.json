  "Acadia National Park/Bar Harbor, Maine\n\nPerhaps this is purely FOMO, because I’ve never had the chance to see Acadia in person, but it’s looking as though this weekend will be capital-P prime fall color viewing in the national park that has everything from mountain to ocean.",
  "As of Oct. 9, foliage in this region — and farther south into the Monongahela National Forest — ranged from “high color” to “past peak.” The tops of the mountains may be overcooked, but lower elevations will be booming with color.",
  "You’re going to see nice fall color in all of the high elevation areas — the Adirondacks, Finger Lakes and Chautauqua-Allegheny regions, to name a few — but the areas around the Catskills may provide the best views.",
  "The Catskills\n\nWhile the trees in parts of New England have already been scoured, Upstate New York appears to be in good shape, according to the Foliage Network and the state’s Department of Economic Development.",
  "As of Oct. 9, the Catskills were in high color, but they also only had “moderate” leaf drop, which means the color is more likely to be on the trees than on the ground this weekend.",
  "Harpers Ferry is a particularly iconic location for leaf peeping, with the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers merging where West Virginia meets Virginia and Maryland.",
  "(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nIt’s been a slow process, but fall color is spreading down off the mountain peaks as we head into the third week of October.",
  "Here are a few of the best fall colors destinations (according to moi) in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, based on the latest Foliage Network report.",
  "I’m especially antsy for fall to arrive in the D.C. region, as we’ve been sweating in 80-degree heat and oppressive humidity for more than a week.",
  "Harpers Ferry\n\nThe historic town on the far eastern tip of West Virginia should begin to explode with color soon, if it hasn’t already.",
  "Davis, W.Va.\n\nDavis is located in northeast West Virginia next to Blackwater Falls State Park and Canaan Valley.",
  "And of course, while you’re there, you might as well head over to Bar Harbor to partake in the lobster.",
  "Enough is enough — time to get some autumn, even if we have to drive for it.",

  "Hillsides and historic bridges make this location even more picturesque."
