  "Jucikas, also Wylie’s former roommate, and Clickard, who have since gone on to create their own company together, said in an email to BuzzFeed News that “it is factually incorrect to suggest that [Jucikas and Clickard] had planned to leave SCL’s Elections division to start their own company in 2014, not least because [Jucikas’] employment contract involved restrictive covenants for work in similar areas.” A slide from Arg.us’s 2014 pitch deck features photos of Jucikas and Clickard as well as Wylie.",
  "“It was like, ‘Hey we have a whole bunch of data on a whole bunch of people, and we don’t have any problems showing you!’ What are the ethical questions about this?”\n\nTrying to Accept Responsibility Wylie’s pitch deck for Arg.us and documents for Eunoia never mentioned what kind of specific data sets Wylie and his team had access to, and his lawyer told BuzzFeed News that the former was never a real company while the latter had no data.",
  "BuzzFeed News has obtained communications that show what he was thinking when he went about creating a similar company to Cambridge Analytica and why being “evil pays more.”\n\nA few months before Christopher Wylie helped build Cambridge Analytica, and five years before he helped bring it down, the data scientist had already settled on an ambition: “I want to build the NSA’s wet dream,” he told an acquaintance.",
  "“I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.” Wylie’s presentation for Arg.us did not mention what kind of data it had access to, but it did tout that his small team had experience with the UK and Canadian governments, the Obama 2008 campaign, and secretive Silicon Valley data analysis company Palantir Technologies.",
  "Ken Strasma, a former Obama campaign staffer, confirmed in an interview with BuzzFeed News that he had been advising Wylie and Eunoia, noting that he thought Wylie’s idea was mainly going to be applied to “predictive analytics for fashion.”\n\nProvided to BuzzFeed News, Obtained by BuzzFeed News Introduction letter for Eunoia, detailing its \"microtargeting\" products.",
  "“It was like, ‘Hey we have a whole bunch of data on a whole bunch of people, and we don’t have any problems showing you!’\"\n\nOne source, who attended the same Victoria, British Columbia high school as Wylie and ended up doing graphic design work for Eunoia in 2014 and 2015, recalled meeting with Wylie and Jucikas on several occasions.",
  "For one thing, the scale and ambition of Wylie and his future colleagues’ data gathering was no facade: Wylie was planning to build a company that could take what millions of people share online every day — such as likes or status updates on Facebook — and turn it into actionable data that could be sold to whoever was willing to pay.",
  "But evil pays more.”\n\nGovernment Dirty Work In late 2013, Wylie, a Canadian data scientist who was then finishing his PhD in fashion forecasting at the London College of Fashion, was mulling over his next move after SCL, a government and elections contractor where he was working as a research director.",
  "“I know they talked with us about how to get access to voter data…and I know they had talked about [the] concept of using Facebook apps to collect data.” \"There were discussions about politics and some other ex CA staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer, Allen, said.",
  "The deck also mentioned that employees at the startup in their previous lines of work “had secured USD $15 million in project finance from a major US hedge fund” — likely referring to Mercer — and said the company was hoping to raise $15 million to $20 million for up to a 20% equity stake.",
  "\"Crazy Evil Russian\" Wylie pitched his company — which he cofounded with SCL colleagues Tadas Jucikas, a data scientist, and Brent Clickard, a psychologist — to several Silicon Valley and European venture capitalists in 2014, eventually changing its name from Arg.us to Eunoia Technologies.",
  "According to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News and interviews with people who knew Wylie, the young data scientist was enthralled by the idea of a tool that years later would be used to create detailed psychological profiles of the US electorate ahead of the 2016 presidential election.",
  "Recalling whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg, Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning, who risked imprisonment and severe punishment for coming forward with important, confidential information, she asked a question that seemed to bury deep into Wylie’s soul: “You came from the dark side.",
  "But given the news of the past week, it may well have been a nod to the information collected by Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University data scientist who's been accused of handing over some 50 million Facebook profiles to third parties in violation of Facebook's terms of service.",
  "The unnamed graphic designer who did work for the startup said that Wylie and its other cofounders slowly stopped responding to his requests in 2015, noting that it’s possible it never launched because of the data scientists’ past relationships or contractual obligations with SCL.",
  "He was also trying to raise money for his new startup concept — then called Arg.us — that would ingest users' social media activity and use it to build “psychographic” profiles that marketers could use to identify our personalities and, possibly, influence our behavior.",
  "In the press, Wylie has expressed remorse over his role in developing what he called “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.” But his earlier correspondence suggests he was acutely aware of how the data collection techniques that he was developing might be used.",
  "So while he continued his day job, Wylie dreamed up a startup of his own, telling friends he wanted to create “the NSA’s wet dream.” As a research director at SCL’s elections division, Wylie had few illusions about the kind of work his firm did.",
  "A source familiar with the matter said that the relationship was purely between Mercer and Cambridge Analytica, and that there was no arrangement between Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund Mercer ran until last year, and the data firm.",
  "Late 2013 communications from Wylie seen by BuzzFeed News, however, refer to an investment from Renaissance as being “on track.” Wylie's attorney told BuzzFeed News her client does not recall speaking to any of the funders of CA about this.",
  "Wylie, who left SCL and Cambridge in the summer of 2014, also bragged to associates about meetings he had with potential corporate clients, including Walmart, Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, Burberry, DKNY, Ford, and Virgin.",
  "Another, sent following the US midterm elections in 2014, included a link to an article about Republicans winning eight out of nine key Senate races, alluding to the idea that SCL and Cambridge Analytica helped these clients.",

  "While a source called Arg.us/Eunoia a precursor to Cambridge Analytica, Allen maintained that they were completely separate entities and that her client eventually left his position because of a \"toxic work environment.\"",
  "The document goes on to list a dozen products and services, among them \"psychographic microtargeting,\" \"addressable TV microtargeting,\" \"multi-agent system voter behavior simulation,\" and \"message testing & development.\"",
  "In one exchange from the documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, Wylie noted that it was relatively easy to determine someone's psychological disposition simply by analyzing a few weeks of their internet browsing.",

  "That was October 2013, and Wylie, in his early twenties, was gathering massive amounts of personal data as research director for SCL Group, a contractor that did military and political campaign work.",
  "“Their focus was on psychographics, but I don’t think they got to a point where they actually identified data assets,” he said, adding that he did not think they were using any Facebook data sets.",
  "Wylie responded to questions through his lawyer, Tamsin Allen, who noted that her client \"has made several flippant and stupid comments in text messages and instant messages, which he regrets.\"",
  "“We would create one of the world's largest population datasets that could massively revolutionise all kinds of scientific research.”\n\n“In theory we could change the world in a positive way.\"",
  "A handful of 2014 emails, drafts of business cards and stationery, and an audio recording reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest Jucikas was heavily involved in Eunoia's planning and development.",
  "In one correspondence, he said he was worried about taking their money because they lacked technological expertise but found the idea of working for a “crazy evil Russian” quite intriguing.",
  "\"You could combine all their data exhaust to create a super model of behaviour and apply hyper-targeting compliance gaining techniques to make people buy stuff,\" he explained to a source.",
  "But while the documents do not always cast Wylie — touted by some as “The Millennials' first great whistleblower” — in a flattering light, they also do not call his claims into question.",
  "“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement Wednesday about Cambridge Analytica.",
  "“What really surprised me with all this is how nonchalant they were about this,” the source said, noting that Eunoia’s founders spoke openly about their political and elections work.",
  "According to the source, it showed a map of the US with pinpoints that, when clicked, would surface personal data on an individual, including location, political leanings, and age.",

  "In public interviews since identifying himself last week, he criticized Kogan, who he said flew back and forth between Russia and did research at a St. Petersburg university.",
  "It also reveals that before Wylie blew the whistle, he was well aware how behavioral micro-targeting could be applied to business and politics — and how it might be abused.",
  "That note claimed Wylie's technology had been tested on political clients and could profile someone’s real-world personality and motivations based on what they did online.",
  "Another showed the company’s first line of business was an estimated $5.2 billion opportunity in politics, complete with logos of the GOP elephant and Democratic donkey.",
  "Before and after he left SCL and Cambridge Analytica in late June 2014, Wylie seemed to have few qualms about the Republican party in messages viewed by BuzzFeed News.",
  "Chatting with a friend in late 2013, he readily volunteered that the company aided coups and handled “government dirty work,” alluding to work in Trinidad and Tobago.",
  "\"He fully accepts his share of responsibility in setting up CA, and has proactively worked with both UK authorities and the media to give attention to the issue.\"",
  "To one person, he mentioned the possibility of the Mercers becoming his first client if he were ever able to separate himself from SCL and start his own venture.",
  "“We might be building a predictive crime data system [in Trinidad],” Wylie told one person later in 2014, comparing it to the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report.",
  "Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who helped found Cambridge Analytica, recently came clean about his role in creating the controversial data mining outfit.",
  "Later that year, Wylie claimed that he had a data set that had consumer data records matched to 10 million Facebook profiles and 45 million LinkedIn profiles.",

  "In late 2013, Wylie, as an SCL employee, met then–Breitbart News leader Steve Bannon who in turn introduced him to hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer.",
  "Instead, he soldiered on, bragging to friends about gaining access to a set of unknown Facebook data that would significantly bolster his research.",
  "And if the documents reveal the Canadian citizen as a complicated figure, that places him in a long line of conflicted and complex whistleblowers.",
  "Around the time he started thinking about starting the company, he was already discussing with friends his close connections to wealthy Russians.",
  "Wylie also spoke about Cambridge Analytica’s contact with Russia’s second-largest oil company, Lukoil, over some questionable project proposals.",
  "\"Standard practice in political campaigns currently targets demographic factors, such as gender, age, region, and ethnic background,\" it reads.",
  "“I’m saying I’m taking the first step to own up to something that I had a really fundamental role on.” “I’m trying to accept responsibility.” ?",
  "Another document obtained by BuzzFeed News details Eunoia’s \"microtargeting\" products, many of them explicitly tailored for use in elections.",
  "At one dinner meeting in London, Jucikas brought out his computer to show a rough mockup of what he, Wylie, and Clickard had been building.",
  "Add their social media activity to the mix, he theorized, and you could probably anticipate how someone might behave in various scenarios.",
  "On Tuesday, at the Frontline Club, Wylie was praised for coming forward with the information and revealing to the world what he had done.",
  "In that country, Wylie claimed to have data that was so granular that he could tell what kind of pornographic video a user was watching.",
  "Wylie even claimed he'd been invited to a meeting with the Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.",
