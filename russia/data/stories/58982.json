  "HANNITY: This is an amazing thing that Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Robert Mueller, who is the same guy that extended the FISA warrant with the phony dossier, which was the bulk of information, that he is -- he did not want Devin Nunes to get any of this material and that only because of digging by you and Congressman Meadows and your staffs were we able to find the latest Strzok-Page messages which show all of this, you know, collusion, if you will, to use a term or at least relationship with this judge that recused himself after he accepted General Flynn's plea.",
  "Any time in law enforcement you can be a patrol officer, you know that when you interfere with lawful authority and this was lawful authority of the federal government and they are sharing private information in law enforcement and she goes out there because she is privy to that and announces it publicly alerting known criminals who don't even have citizenship in our country that hey, the cops are coming.",
  "And I don't know if any judge did anything wrong, but certainly, there's enough for the court to begin an internal investigation of how the judges communicated with the FBI, were all the communications appropriate and disclosed in a way that the public can be sure -- assured that there was the fair administration of justice in the operations of the FISA court.",
  "And this gets -- so, why are they trying to hide, remember, Devin Nunes waited until the final five minutes before the subpoena of this information from the DOJ that should have been handed over much earlier and now, Congressman Jordan, Congressman Meadows, Congressman DeSantis, they have to send their entire staffs over.",
  "Remember back in January, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein begging in the final hours before they had to turn this information over, begging Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, allow the DOJ not to turn over the documents related to the Russia investigation to Devin Nunes and these congressional committees.",
  "In an attempt to prove his, quote, \"vindictive prosecution and collusion agreement,\" Garcia Zarate's cites comments President Trump and the Attorney General Jeff Sessions had made in the past regarding his case and is seeking all communications that the U.S. government has had with local law enforcement agencies.",
  "Now, this would mean we would get to see exactly how that fake news dossier, the bulk of which was used to get the FISA warrant against Page was used and how the FBI misled on purpose, purpose live omitted information to FISA judges about Clinton, that she bought and paid for fake news phony Russian dossier.",
  "For months we have literally been bringing you the American people on a nightly basis breaking news, hard-hitting, investigative reports about the corruption at some of the highest levels of our government including the shocking details about the abuse of power at the very top of the FBI.",

  "So, that's going to be very interesting and what Gregg said is very important, because, remember, Flynn was cornered and even after Strzok and the other agent interviewed Flynn, according to the sources, according to James Comey himself, they believed that he did not lie.",
  "And sources have been telling us that Judge Contreras may have signed off on one of the FISA applications to approve the warrant to spy on Carter Page, Trump associate, which means the Trump campaign which likely gave the FBI access to Trump campaign communications.",
  "That same judge, the text messages make very clear had a friendship and relationship with Peter Strzok, the guy who was deputy head of counterintelligence at the FBI and the -- excuse me, the Justice Department made it difficult for us to get that information.",
  "And the reason I have a problem with it is you have got to give the attorneys an A for effort on behalf of their client but this is absolutely ridiculous, Sean, and sorry, I'm not going to disagree with you guys on this just from a legal factual perspective.",
  "Now, there were four separate FISA court judges that were all lied to because they never informed the judges in the application that Hillary had bought and paid for unverified, uncorroborated what turned out to be many Russian lies to influence the election.",
  "Leon Panetta, Hayden, Morrell, all of these folks that are sort of at the top echelon of the intelligence community in a bipartisan degree, one administration over the next, all support her because she is imminently qualified with over 30 years experience.",

  "He oversaw the January 2017 White House interview of Lieutenant General Flynn and here's what we really need more information on, Strzok is the former FBI counter intelligence official who signed the paperwork to start the entire Russia investigation.",
  "Well, it's pretty clear that Peter Strzok was intending to manipulate a federal judge who is also a FISA judge and had -- and may have made one of the decisions to spy on Carter Page to the damage of the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency.",
  "When you look at the law it's very clear what he was acquitted of is not what the federal government is going after him for, which he clearly has been guilty of which is entering the United States illegally and illegal possession of a firearm.",

  "Now, Sara Carter reporting that congressional investigators working for Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Mark Meadows, they discovered these text messages at the DOJ's headquarters and this is part of the outrage.",
  "This is a sick twist in the fact that here this criminal illegal, who has been not only deported five times, he was wanted for six times before the sanctuary policies released him before turning him over to ICE.",
  "And it's real concerning that this isn't happening during the Obama administration but by appointees President Trump, you know, Jeff Sessions has got to step up and take back control of the Justice Department.",
  "And Director Wray is completely out to lunch on these issues where is he more concerned about the institution of the FBI and protecting its reputation than cleaning house in terms of the corruption issues.",
  "And so, any time anybody from the committee want to see a semi, just as very less redacted version of the 3,162 pages that they got, they have to go over to the DOJ and then try to put the pieces together.",
  "We need to know one thing about this woman and it's clear that she has it is whether or not she is qualified to be one of the most powerful government officials in the most powerful nation in the world.",

  "Just a few months ago, McCabe was put on leave after current FBI Director Christopher Wray was reportedly informed that McCabe was going to be exposed in the upcoming inspector general's report.",
  "It's all part of a year-long pattern of obstruction, of stonewalling, noncompliance, and Congress' enforce, by the way and constitutional duty to investigate and oversee the actions at the DOJ.",
  "Now Haspel is a career intelligence officer who has been praised by colleagues for her very important work after 9/11 and she would be the first woman to serve as the CIA director if confirmed.",
  "There is this culture of arrogance at the FBI and Justice Department that impedes virtually any oversight either by Judicial Watch to the courts or Congress through its constitutional powers.",
  "As for that very important context, we learned that Strzok and Judge Contreras were friends and that Judge Contreras oversaw the Flynn case which after he accepted the plea, it was a mystery.",
  "Strzok follows up with, well, she brought up a good point about being circumspect in talking to him in terms of not placing him in a situation where he'd have to actually recuse himself.",
  "So the federal government is within its right, although his attorneys, I think it's crazy they are going to lose both of these in my opinion, they are doing their best for their client.",
  "I tell you, this corruption at the Obama Justice Department and FBI which continues in some way today, not only ruined the Justice Department and FBI it's now splashed onto the courts.",
  "According to Sara Carter of the 1.2 million documents the DOJ inspector general has acquired, the House Oversight Committee has only received just over 3,000, quote, unique documents.",

  "FITTON: -- raise questions about what was going on and why the court recuse themselves without telling the public, what was the reason for doing so in such a high profile case.",
  "And then it was solidified here in the United States after it was briefed to both President Obama and President-elect Trump and then leaked by BuzzFeed and posted on BuzzFeed.",
  "You know, when I used to appear in front of judges occasionally, they would recuse themselves, but they would explain their recusal on the record to be honest and forthright.",
  "Wow, here with reaction, Fox News national security strategist, former deputy assistant to the president, Sebastian Gorka, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",

  "And also brand new tonight, USA Today is reporting that the Justice Department is considering publicly releasing parts of the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page.",
  "This is a major development and could finally provide answers to very key questions about Hillary's bought and paid for dossier and if Steele tried to ever even verify it.",
  "So, in other words, Steele will under oath have to admit whether or not he knew the dossier was full of lies from his phony Russian sources, but gave it to the FBI anyway.",
  "SPICER: I was going to say, I mean, look, we got more great economic news today if it wasn't for the president tweeting it out to his followers we wouldn't know about it.",
  "And then I heard Hillary this week say, the reason I lost is because white women listen to their husbands, to their bosses and their sons before voting for Donald Trump.",
  "Now, we need to know all the communications between Strzok, Page, and Contreras, as a matter of fact, release all the Strzok/Page text messages, everything you have got.",
  "And then Strzok responds, yes, generally does know what I do, not to the level of the scope or area, but he is super thoughtful and rigorous about ethics and conflicts.",
  "Why did you draft a letter exonerating Hillary Clinton of charges in the email investigation months before she was interviewed by the FBI and 17 other important people?",
  "But if you want to really want to reach all Americans, defend your honor, if you really want to tell the truth, we've got a lot of questions for you, come on this show.",

  "We are talking about people that not only didn't respect our laws and sovereignty but then came here and committed more crimes, and in many cases violent crimes.",
  "And if it is true that Flynn and his lawyer didn't full know that they had actually been exonerated by these agents, then his guilty play ought to be set aside.",
  "Newly obtained text messages are showing that Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok, well, he was close friends with U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras.",
  "Because any future crime that these criminals commit, how can she not be held liable and responsible as an accomplice to those and have blood on her own hands.",
  "TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, they were just oversight not only from Congress and Department of Justice and FBI do, but also from the courts.",

  "And, look, the lawsuit against Christopher Steele is very important, because Christopher Steele slandered a lot of people in that dossier.",
  "And we know that Peter Strzok is the head of the counterintelligence at the FBI, so he had to have been involved in that FISA application.",
  "What is really inexcusable is that the Department of Justice fought like hell, especially Rod Rosenstein to keep this information secret.",
  "And according to that you report from Axios, Comey is planning to come out hot and correct all the so-called lies about him and the FBI.",

  "DESANTIS: Well, I will tell you, you know, Peter Strzok has done so much damage to the reputation of the FBI with his arrogance.",
  "Page then texts I can't imagine either one of you ever talking about anything in detail, meaningful enough to warrant a recusal.",
  "And so, you know, this is over zealous prosecutors and the power government that can ruin you financially and destroy your life.",
  "You know, we have to have these questions answered because in December 1st, 2017, General Flynn sat before him and pled guilty.",
  "Wouldn't you want to clear the air so the American people can move on, but yet, they fight us tooth and nail on every issue?",

  "And according to a new book, Steele told friends that it was kind of 50/50 about the most salacious part of the dossier.",
  "There was a recusal, there was a relationship between the judge and Peter Strzok a central figure in this whole of fair.",
  "HANNITY: Well, what do you make of -- what do you make of Judge Contreras relationship with Peter Strzok in all of this.",
  "For example, did you in fact tell a closed session of Congress that you believed Michael Flynn did not lie to the FBI?",
  "The mainstream media, liberal democrats they seem only interested in smearing the long serving intelligence official.",

  "I can tell you it's unusual for a court to recuse themselves from a case like this without an explanation.",
