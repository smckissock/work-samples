  "But first: The midterm is among the most consequential, so 12 House Republicans are calling on President Trump to declassify documents related to that FBI probe of Russian actions during the 2016 presidential election, specifically the surveillance renewal applications the FBI used to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page and forms relating to the Justice Department's official Bruce Ohr contacts with Trump dossier author Christopher Steele.",

  "KALLSTROM: And now it's crystal clear that there's a cabal, a far-reaching cabal, way beyond the bureau, into the intelligence community, into Brennan, into the National Security Council, into Samantha Power, I mean, into all these peripheral people, putting this thing together, this fraud against Trump and this fraud investigation, Mueller and the bullying tactics of Mueller and his cast of characters over there.",
  "And the documents that the House is asking the president for release about how corrupt the Department of Justice was on President Obama's watch, they need to be released, because, on President Obama's watch, the Department of Justice was political and corrupt to its core, and the top levels of the FBI under President Obama, on President Obama's watch were also corrupt, fired and facing indictment.",
  "(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: I'm glad it's continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that's been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, and, suddenly, Republicans are saying, it's a miracle, I have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016 and...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARTIROMO: Your reaction, Congressman?",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We do not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: ... or to explicitly call on the attorney general to protect members of our own party from persecution -- prosecution because an election happens to be coming up.",
  "But I also agree with those members who have called upon the president to declassify the documents that are necessary for the American people to see what was going on in 2016 and early 2017 regarding the disparate way the FBI handled these two major investigations, one involving Hillary Clinton, the other involving the Trump campaign.",
  "So if I were the president, for transparency's sakes, for oversight sake, for reforming the Department of Justice and FBI to get a better product in the future, I would release this just to show what President Obama said about how good his FBI and Department of Justice actually were.",
  "The new book by Woodward comes out this upcoming week, \"Fear,\" and then you have got this op-ed that The New York Times released from an anonymous source who says he's trying to stop the president from making all these bad decisions, but he is on the resist movement's side.",

  "I think North Korea and China believe, if he had to, President Trump would use military force to protect the American homeland from a missile with a nuclear weapon on top of it coming from North Korea that he's going to end their nuclear program one way or the other.",
  "If you were to release the documents before the investigation was launched in July of '16, we could clearly see the conversations that took place to better understand why Hillary Clinton wasn't investigated and why they were trying to stop Donald Trump.",
  "Let me move on to this op-ed from The New York Times this past week, because, with all of this going on...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBARTIROMO: ... the detractors on the left are basically trying to paint a picture of massive chaos all the time in the White House.",
  "And what a tragedy to have something this big, this nauseous, this bad, trying to disrupt the legitimately elected president of the United States, and not only that, but the constitutional rights of literally hundreds of Americans that were unmasked.",
  "The Congress did exactly the right thing in passing the tax reform legislation, putting more money back in the hands of the American people, so they could spend it and invest it in ways that have resulted in very, very substantial job growth.",

  "This is an unbelievable economy because of what this president has been able to achieve, not even counting what we have done with the VA or made you safer with our battles against opioids or the military being stronger.",

  "If you ever wondered, is there a deep state, is there somebody high in government that will hide behind media to work against the voters of America and create a constitutional crisis, it's proven today that it is.",
  "And they have these protections -- all these companies do -- through the Section 230 that says basically they're just a platform here and not responsible for content, except now they are responsible for content.",
  "I was very disappointed in the tone of the hearing, trying to suggest that Judge Kavanaugh wasn't telling the truth about a conversation between him and some person in a 300-person law firm that bore no fruit.",
  "BARTIROMO: And you said the nine bills that you're going to put on the president's desk before the end of September deal with other substance, but 90 percent of the federal budget will have to be approved.",
  "And then to use that information to try to get and, in fact, succeed and getting warrants to investigate, to listen in on Carter Page, this is a serious abuse of power, and it should never happen again.",
  "BARTIROMO: Well, why wouldn't the president declassify these documents, so that the American people can understand how this whole investigation was hatched and what took place during the 2016 election?",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nMCCARTHY: It's just unbelievable what he's coming back -- and the idea that he doesn't take the respect of past presidents -- you never saw George Bush going out talking in a campaign.",
  "Do you think we're ever going to see accountability for the fact of what you just said, there was no investigation of Clinton, and yet there was this phony investigation, as you put it, of Trump?",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nBARTIROMO: I want to get your take on that, because what was noticeably different this time in terms of the celebrations going on in North Korea was no display of long-range missiles.",
  "And it is, again, a part of this overall problem with the leadership in the FBI and some in the Department of Justice in 2016 who were abusing their powers in ways that are very inappropriate.",
  "And he needs to do it, of course, to protect sources and methods, but he should do it, and he should do it quickly, so that the American people have the benefit of this information right now.",
  "You have got the number four person at the Department of Justice ,who basically is in narcotics, handling Christopher Steele, who's the chief author of the dossier used to get a FISA warrant.",
  "If you doubled all the taxes people pay for right now, they couldn't pay for the cost of what this would be; 55 percent of Americans get their insurance from private -- from their companies.",
  "GOODLATTE: It's also critical -- it's also critical that we point out how that effort and curtailing abusive government regulations is leading to major employment for women, for minorities.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, first of all, I think it's vitally important that we focus on exactly what has been accomplished by this administration, and that is economic growth and job creation.",
  "It is a national security issue, because this person openly works with media, openly says he works against this president and this administration, which is working against the voters.",
  "Senators on the Judiciary Committee are expected to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation to the high court on September 20, that followed by a vote by the full Senate the following week.",
  "You're leaving out the fact that the director of the FBI under your watch, Mr. Comey, actually leaked internal memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel appointed.",

  "We're looking at the headline of the letter to the editor written by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, firing back at the anonymous op-ed in The New York Times.",
  "Under President Trump, we're going to fund about 70 to 80 percent of the government before September the 30th, the first time we have done that in 30 years.",

  "BARTIROMO: Senator, why won't the president declassify the documents, so that the American people can understand and clearly see...\n\nGRAHAM: I have no idea.",
  "As to the author of the op-ed piece, they suggest that, if it weren't for him and a few others, the president wouldn't be doing good things for the country.",
  "So I think The New York Times is trying to start a new narrative by publishing an op-ed piece from an anonymous source to suggest the president is unhinged.",
  "The committee received just last night, less than 15 hours ago, 42,000 pages of documents that we have not had an opportunity to review or read or analyze.",

  "And there are others we want to hear from, including Google, because when you think about how we communicate...\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, did Google blow it off?",
  "GRAHAM: So I think Trump has convinced Kim Jong-un and China that the best way for North Korea to be safe and secure is to give up your nuclear weapons.",
  "We are safer today not only in our economy and our jobs and in our schools, but around the world, because of this majority working with this president.",
  "BARTIROMO: And...\n\nGRAHAM: I think Trump has convinced him that you're better off without nuclear weapons than you are with them...\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.",
