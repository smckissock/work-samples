  "Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater U.S.A., told CBS News chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan, in an interview to air on 60 Minutes, that he welcomes any additional oversight the U.S. government would impose on his armed guards, and that he supports the prosecution of his men should any of them be found to have acted badly when they opened fire on a Baghdad street, resulting in 17 Iraqi deaths, and at least 24 others wounded.",
  "While a U.S. military report has concluded the Blackwater team was not fired upon in the incident at Nisour Square, Prince vigorously defended the training of his men and believes they acted according to the rules of engagement under which the U.S. military operates.",
  "\"I think the overall purpose of my job in building bridges with the Iraqis and positively affecting their lives was hindered by some of the aggressive tactics and the stance that private security contractors such as Blackwater displayed,\" Gans says.",

  "He also says he has evidence they were fired upon: \"The fact is three of our vehicles had pock marks in them from incident reports that I saw.",
  "Adam Hobson agrees: \"I went to a meeting and somebody died because of it, and it made the meetings in the future seem a lot less important.\"",
