  "The Westfall Act was passed in 1988 as an amendment to the Federal Torts Claim Act \"to protect federal employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the common law torts of federal employees with an appropriate remedy against the United States.\"",
  "In defending the government's position, West cited case law stating that \"genocide, torture, forced relocation, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment by individual defendants employed by Department of Defense and State Department were within scope of employment\" and similar cases justifying CIA torture as part of official duty.",
  "\"The idea that the United States government should accept liability for the unprovoked criminal manslaughter of seventeen innocent Iraqis by Blackwater mercenaries, and place it on the back of taxpayers, is corporate animism run amok,\" says Ralph Nader, who has spent his entire career fighting against corporate personhood.",
  "\"It's clear that if they win this motion and the government is substituted, since the wrongs occurred in a foreign country, the government is absolutely immune and the case will be dismissed,\" says Alan Morrison, a former federal prosecutor who is now the associate dean for public interest at George Washington Law School.",
  "They charge that the lawyers suing Blackwater are attempting to \"use this litigation as a 'megaphone' to increase their ability to influence the public's perceptions regarding the use of contractors in military battlefield situations, the Iraq War, and most particularly about Erik Prince and the other defendants.",
  "In a motion filed August 10, Prince's lawyers asked Judge Ellis to strike from the record the sworn statements of the two former employees, saying that \"the conclusory allegations they contain are inadmissible on multiple grounds, including lack of foundation, hearsay, irrelevance, and unfair prejudice.\"",
  "Reached by telephone, Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that because of her oath of secrecy on sensitive intelligence issues, she could neither confirm nor deny that Congress was aware of Blackwater's involvement in this program before the Times report.",
  "Earlier, in response to questions from The Nation, a Justice Department spokesperson sent a memo filed by the department earlier this year in a similar case against Blackwater in federal court in Florida, in which the department had rejected the company's attempt to make the government responsible.",
  "The Times reports that \"the CIA did not have a formal contract with Blackwater for this program but instead had individual agreements with top company officials, including the founder, Erik D. Prince, a politically connected former member of the Navy Seals and the heir to a family fortune.\"",
  "Attorney Susan Burke and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), who are suing Prince and his companies on behalf of their Iraqi victims, have alleged that Prince is \"equivalent to a top mafia boss who is responsible for all the day-to-day crimes committed at his direction and behest.\"",
  "Its Global Fusion Center, complete with large-screen TVs broadcasting international news channels and computer stations staffed by analysts surfing the web, \"operates around the clock every day of the year\" and is modeled after the CIA's counterterrorist center, once run by Black.",
  "On June 26 Holder's office intervened in a lawsuit filed by CCR against Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and twenty-three other military and medical officials \"for their role in the illegal detention, torture, inhumane conditions and ultimate deaths\" of two Guantánamo prisoners.",
  "Since the first case was filed by Iraqi civilians against Prince and Blackwater over the killing of seventeen Iraqis at Baghdad's Nisour Square on September 16, 2007, the company's high-powered lawyers have fought feverishly to have that and four other cases dismissed.",
  "\"When Blackwater chooses to interpose itself in the middle and to make profit off these individual employees in the relationship with the government, the notion that Blackwater itself, a corporation, could be an employee is unusual to say the least,\" says Morrison.",
  "\"Defendants' request for Westfall Act certification should be denied because only natural persons can be considered 'employee[s] of the government,'\" Assistant Attorney General Tony West wrote on June 8 in a thirty-five-page filing opposing Blackwater's motion.",
  "Citing the Westfall Act, Tony West wrote that \"the type of activities alleged against the individual defendants were 'foreseeable' and were 'a direct outgrowth' of their responsibility to detain and gather intelligence from suspected enemy combatants.\"",
  "\"The presidential memos (often referred to as 'findings') authorizing covert action like the lethal activities of the CIA and Blackwater have not yet surfaced,\" says Ray McGovern, a retired twenty-seven-year CIA analyst who once served as George H.W.",
  "In his motion, Blackwater lawyer Peter White of the powerhouse firm Mayer Brown argued that the company was working for the State Department in Iraq and therefore was on official business when the alleged killings and injuries of Iraqis took place.",
  "\"If Blackwater wants to be treated like a person, then its latest mutation, USTC, should be prosecuted, convicted and given the equivalent penalty of corporate capital punishment by revoking its charter and terminating its corporate operations.\"",

  "Shortly after Prince arrived in Afghanistan in May 2002, according to a former Blackwater executive who was with Prince, the Blackwater owner focused on winning more business with government agencies, providing private soldiers for hire.",
  "The Post reported that Blackwater \"was given operational responsibility for targeting terrorist commanders and was awarded millions of dollars for training and weaponry, but the program was canceled before any missions were conducted.\"",
  "It's analogous to what we hear about torture that was being done in the name of Americans, when we simply handed somebody over to the Syrians or the Egyptians or others and then we turn around and say, 'We're not torturing people.'\"",
  "Black would later brag, in 2004, that \"over 70 percent\" of Al Qaeda's leadership had been arrested, detained or killed, and that \"more than 3,400 of their operatives and supporters have also been detained and put out of an action.\"",
  "Burke also alleges that Prince has committed \"violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal statute permitting private parties to seek redress from criminal enterprises who damage their property.\"",

  "\"What the agency was doing with Blackwater scares the hell out of me,\" said Jack Rice, a former CIA field operator who worked for the directorate of operations, which runs covert paramilitary activities for the CIA.",
  "\"When the agency actually cedes all oversight and power to a private organization, an organization like Blackwater, most importantly they lose control and don't understand what's going on,\" Rice told The Nation.",
  "Schakowsky has called for a review of all of the companies' current contracts, and she has called on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to stop awarding the company contracts.",
  "\"What we know now, if this is true, is that Blackwater was part of the highest level, the innermost circle strategizing and exercising strategy within the Bush administration,\" Schakowsky told The Nation.",
  "He adds: \"A gigantic, for-profit corporation is seeking to use this statute, designed to protect government employees, to shield themselves from any responsibility for the deaths and injuries\" of Iraqis.",
  "Now, facing a crucial August 28 hearing in federal court in Virginia, they are putting forward a new argument: instead of Prince and Blackwater standing trial, the US government should be the defendant.",

  "In September 2002, five months after Blackwater's first known contract with the CIA in Afghanistan, Black testified to Congress about the new \"operational flexibility\" employed in the \"war on terror.\"",
  "What they'd be saying [if Blackwater's interpretation of the Westfall Act is accepted] is they would have wanted to assume liability for that which they didn't have any liability in the first place.\"",
  "Most notable among these was J. Cofer Black, who was running the CIA's counterterrorism operations and leading the hunt for Osama bin Laden when Blackwater was initially hired by the CIA in 2002.",

  "Blackwater worked for the CIA at its station in Kabul as well as in Shkin, along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where they operated out of a mud fortress known as the Alamo.",
  "That visit took place after the CIA contract was signed, according to the former executive, and Krongard \"may have come down just to see the company that he had just hired.\"",
  "\"It is essentially saying torture is all in a day's work when it comes to holding people in military detention,\" says Shane Kadidal, who heads the Guantánamo project at CCR.",
  "Burke and CCR are suing Prince and his companies directly rather than his individual employees because they say Prince \"wholly owns and personally controls all Defendants.\"",
  "In 2002 Prince, along with former CIA operative Jamie Smith, created Blackwater Security Consulting, which would put former Navy SEALs and other special ops on the market.",
  "\"Why would Congress want to, in effect, transfer liability from a large, well-heeled corporation like Blackwater to the United States taxpayers for this kind of conduct?",
