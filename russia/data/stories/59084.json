  "Similar to the one he's having to deal with on North Korea where Iran is enriched with sanctions relief, it would have been an ICBM because that's not covered in the Iran nuclear deal, capable of targeting our homeland, and then a nuclear break out after the sunset provision closes out after 15 years with centrifuges and enrichment of uranium that they can break out with a nuclear weapon.",
  "The Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows who has been on the show a lot, along with several other House Republicans, they have drafted articles of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein over the extremely slow release or just flat out obstruction regarding subpoenaed documents related to the Clinton email investigation and, of course, the dossier and FISA abuse and the Russia investigation.",

  "HANNITY: David Schoen, on Rod Rosenstein and his own words today, when he signed one of those FISA applications and if I am right, Sara, bear me out on this, he signed the last one and they still don't know, remember, it was Deputy McCabe and it would not have been an application without the dossier?",
  "And perhaps, the most pathetic deep state actor of all, James Comey -- well, the guy that refused to come on this show, I offered him four hours of airtime -- he's continuing his anti- Trump book tour, and is actually claiming that Trump's criticism of the deep state is dangerous for the country.",
  "And that's for the extortion bit that Rosenstein tried to say --\n\nHANNITY: Who are these guys that signed off on an unverified, uncorroborated Russian dossier that never told the judges in their applications, renewal applications, Gregg Jarrett, this is -- this is a year's worth of lies.",

  "Insiders here focusing on the part of \"The New York Times\" story saying that the list of questions from Mueller was compiled by the president's lawyers, led at the time as I noted by Dowd, after a series of consultations that Dowd, you see him there, had with Mueller.",
  "To ask questions as Mr. Mueller apparently proposes to do about what the president was thinking when he fired Comey or Flynn or anybody else is an outrageous sophomoric, juvenile intrusion into the president's unfettered power to fire anyone in the executive branch.",

  "The bottom line is, the list you've been talking about, over 40 questions, is so broad that people close to the process are telling me tonight it makes it less likely that the president will ever sit for an interview with Mueller.",
  "And just like Hillary Clinton's interview, after the exoneration was written months later, oh, Trump's interview should be conducted not under oath, not recorded, not be transcribed, and the exoneration written months in advance.",
