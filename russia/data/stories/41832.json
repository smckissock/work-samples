  "Renewable energy for income investors\n\nMaxx Chatsko (TerraForm Power): Most wind farms in the United States are eligible to receive something called the production tax credit (PTC), which provides extra income for the renewable electricity they send to the grid.",
  "Well, wind power will go from generating about 1% of total American electricity in 2008 to roughly 7% in 2019 -- and become the top renewable energy source in the country, marking the first time in over 100 years that the distinction doesn't go to hydropower.",
  "Companies such as TerraForm Power purchase equity stakes in wind power assets across the country, generate funds from operations (FFO) from the electricity sold, and return a giant chunk of that to unitholders.",
  "Iron Mountain enjoys a near monopoly in providing storage services for records and data, with over 225,000 customers, including roughly 95% of the Fortune 1,000.",
  "The new parent also provided a credit line to jump-start the purchase of renewable energy assets that have the potential to drive growth for years to come.",
  "In 2017 TerraForm Power found a new parent in Brookfield Asset Management, which moved quickly to inject more operational efficiency into the business.",
  "We asked a team of Motley Fool investors, and they picked TerraForm Power (NASDAQ: TERP), Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM), and STORE Capital (NYSE: STOR).",
  "Right now the company's dividend yield sits at 6.9%, but management expects to grow that by 5% to 8% per year for the next five years at least.",
  "Iron Mountain has boosted its dividend by a whopping 118% over the past five years, compared to IBM's dividend hikes of 65% during the period.",
  "Sure, IBM isn't far away from becoming a Dividend Aristocrat, with the company claiming 22 consecutive years of dividend increases.",
  "IBM competes in a cutthroat world of well-heeled rivals trying to one-up one another in rolling out technological advances.",
  "Simply put, this high-yield renewable energy stock is capitalizing on a generous trend in the American power sector.",
  "Those efforts are expected to shave off $25 million per year in operating expenses for the next two or three years.",
  "But I think investors should, like Janet Jackson sang years ago, ask, \"What have you done for me lately?\"",
  "In other words, the PTC has been pretty lucrative -- and individual investors can share in the profits.",
  "A dividend dream stock\n\nKeith Speights (Iron Mountain): IBM's dividend yield currently stands at 4.35%.",
  "But are there any stocks that offer a higher yield than IBM and are a better bet moving forward?",
  "Investors looking for income should definitely at least put TerraForm Power on their watchlist.",
  "Shares currently yield 4.35%, significantly higher than the 1.8% yield offered by the S&P 500.",
  "IBM (NYSE: IBM) used to be a tech titan that could be relied upon to deliver steady growth.",
  "Unfortunately, Big Blue has struggled in recent years to keep pace with the changing times.",
  "Investors have responded in kind by knocking down the company's valuation to historic lows.",
  "Does that automatically make Iron Mountain the better stock for income-seeking investors?",
  "The upside to IBM's low valuation is that it has turned into a high-yield stock.",
  "Business man handing money to another person More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.",
  "I'd put Iron Mountain's competitive advantages at the top of the list.",
  "No -- but I think that other factors do.",
  "Put dividend hikes on the list, too.",
  "Iron Mountain's yield tops 7%.",
  "How lucrative is the subsidy?",
  "The stage is set for success."
