  "A senior administration official dismissed the focus on Fleitz's past publications as a \"baseless\" attack and blamed the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups \"for waging a vengeful smear campaign for Fleitz's past criticisms of the group, which has been known to attack prominent conservative thought leaders and label them bigots.\"",
  "The report also argued academic institutions that accept donations from \"shariah-adherent individuals or governments\" should be \"discouraged\" from promoting things like \"interfaith dialogue\" or \"Muslim-Christian understanding,\" because that effort \"amounts to promoting shariah or civilization jihadist agendas.\"",
