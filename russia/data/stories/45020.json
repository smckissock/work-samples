  "“I think one of the parts that [Spiegel] was really excited about with this release is how much better our approach to our users in that way really is — Without relying on things like policy or developer's best intentions or them writing perfect bug free code, but instead by design, not even exposing these things to begin with.”\n\nYet judging by Facebook’s continued growth and recovered share price, privacy is too abstract of a concept for many people to grasp.",
  "Snap Kit is a set of developer tools that really allow people to take the best parts of our products and the standards that we've set in a few of these areas, and bring them into their apps.”\n\nThis focus on privacy manifests as a limit of 90 days of inactivity before your connection with an app is severed.",

  "That’s critical since Snapchat sunk to its lowest user growth rate ever last quarter under the weight of competition from Instagram and WhatsApp.",
  "“It really became challenging for us to see our users then use other products throughout their day and have to lower their expectations.",
  "And the login features only requires you bring along your changeable Snapchat display name, and optionally, your Bitmoji.",
