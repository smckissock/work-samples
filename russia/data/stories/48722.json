  "But I personally think the biggest challenge is the job displacements and how we should rethink the meaning of our lives, not in terms of how hard we work but in terms of why is it that people exist, because the definition of life as \"work as hard as you can and make lots of money\" isn’t relevant anymore.",
  "So while in the U.S. a company like Groupon or a company like Yelp or Instagram are happy building a very shallow layer of technology and then let other people do the heavy lifting, people in China will dive into doing tough, ugly and unappreciated work but ultimately for that 10% better in margin.",
  "Because AI is about optimizing on the huge amount of data, China having more data – whether in face recognition, more people with mobile usage, or 50 times more mobile payment transactions – all of that is a treasure trove of data that is like rocket fuel to make China’s AI better.",

  "Over time, that American self-entitled leadership eroded as we went into the age of lithium, the age of mobile, and the age of social.",

  "But if you go to a Chinese Meituan or a Didi or a WeChat, they look completely different from five years ago.",
  "The AI capabilities are phenomenal, but it’s built upon one domain, not multi-domain, and upon lots of data.",
