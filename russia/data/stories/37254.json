  "Sees No Clear Link to Russia.”) Spayd, who rebuked the coverage in a January 22 column, was particularly interested in “a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin.” She concluded, “I believe a strong case can be made that the Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had”—or at least not before Slate ended up revealing the Alfa Bank connection in an October 31 feature (controversial in its own right) titled, “Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?”\n\nTwo individuals with knowledge of the matter said Baquet was initially hot on the server story, but as the national security team dug into it, they threw up red flags, advising Baquet that their reporting didn’t support a definitive link.",
  "... We reported the hell out of this, as did other news organizations, and we could prove nothing more than that there was some packets of information from a bank to Trump Tower.” Spayd, a former Washington Post managing editor who only briefly overlapped with Baron, ended up leaving the Times in June, after just a year on the job, when the paper eliminated the position of public editor after 16 years; Baquet declined to comment on whether he was in favor of eliminating the position, or whether Sulzberger, to whom the public editor reported, consulted him on the decision.",
  "New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet was being grilled by his own media columnist recently during a sardonically titled talk, “Covering POTUS: A Conversation with the Failing NYT,” when someone in the audience asked: “Better slogan: ‘The truth is more important now than ever,’ or ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness?’”\n\nThe former was from a brand campaign the Times kicked off during the Oscars; the latter was the Washington Post’s new motto, an old saying that had been invoked by owner Jeff Bezos in an interview last year with Marty Baron, the Post’s editor.",
  "“This is a time we are compelled to fight for free expression and a free press—rights granted us under the Constitution, yes, but also the very qualities that have long set us apart from other nations,” Baron declared in accepting the Hitchens Prize, adding that “the ultimate defense of press freedom lies in our daily work.”\n\nOn May 22, Baron was in New York at the Harvard Club, where he was both the guest speaker and the recipient of a First Amendment Award at the Deadline Club’s annual dinner.",
  "On top of the bread-and-butter reporting it has been doing for decades, that now includes an army of blogs, like the popular Morning Mix, which scours the Web to pick up juicy stories from around the U.S. and the world; a robust social media presence that makes it hard not to want to click on articles like a D.C. cop dance-off or the pope blessing a disabled boy; and a contributor platform called PostEverything in which outside writers offer up hot takes and personal essays.",
  "Baron also spearheaded the creation of a “rapid response investigations team,” announced in January, that is “expected to move quickly, mine digital sources of information, and dig deeply as breaking news provides targets of journalistic opportunity.”\n\n“As a reader, it feels like the Post is being distinctive in breaking news,” said ABC News political director Rick Klein, who follows both newspapers obsessively (and who worked under Baron at the Globe).",
  "“The Times, to me, they still win on the big picture, what the big things mean.” That was about as close as I could get to someone being willing to pick a horse on the record, until I asked Gellman, who prefaced his assessment by emphasizing that he hasn’t been an employee of the Post for seven years and has no skin in the game: “I think the Post has the edge right now.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn terms of manpower, though, the Times still has the upper hand.",
  "One former colleague said it made sense that Baquet, who was raised in a black working-class neighborhood in New Orleans, came from a family that owned a restaurant, where “making people feel welcome is part of the ethos.” This person added: “I never left a meeting with Dean where I didn’t feel happy.”\n\nFrom left, Arianna Huffington, Baquet and Dylan Landis attend The New York Times Magazine Relaunch Event in New York City on Feb. 18, 2015.",
  "… These are two strong news organizations competing vigorously with each other, as they should.”\n\nBaquet, who is regarded as the more congenial of the two—and also the one more likely to offer long-winded assessments and analysis—put it this way in Austin: “The competition between the Washington Post and the New York Times is—20 percent of me hates it, because they beat us sometimes, but 80 percent of me thinks, this is amazing.",
  "“They are the paper of record for the sweep of history, so as competitive as they are, Dean would hold something until it’s ready.” On the other hand: “I think Marty is probably always looking over his shoulder, feeling the breath of the New York Times on his neck.”\n\nHere’s one more individual who has worked with Baquet and Baron at different times: “Dean is more of a journalistic visionary, a journalistic renaissance man.",
  "He was introduced by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, the co-writers of Spotlight, who warmly roasted their subject’s dead-serious demeanor while praising him as “relentlessly accurate and highly efficient,” with “the simplicity of a master craftsman.” Bringing it back to the Post’s recent work covering the 45th president, Singer concluded, “Little did we know back in 2012, it wasn’t just a good day for the Post.",
  "And if Snowden’s revelations ended up endangering national security or costing the lives of U.S. assets abroad, as some were cautioning, or if the Post were to get even one small aspect of the story wrong, they would be widely condemned—not to mention running the very palpable risk that the government might try to compel the Post to turn over its source materials, or the possibility of a criminal proceeding.",
  "Authorities say there is no indication of that so far.”\n\nAt the Times, Baquet got a nasty sting from the paper’s public editor, Liz Spayd, when she channeled a criticism that was palpable in certain precincts of the Times’ giant readership of East Coast liberals, where there was consternation that the Times’ hadn’t sooner established potential ties between Trump and the Kremlin.",
  "“I like Dean and I respect him, but I think Marty is seen as the pre-eminent editor of our era.”\n\nBaron and Liev Schreiber attend the 2016 Film Independent Spirit Awards on Feb. 27, 2016, in Santa Monica, Calif. | Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nHere he is posing with his theatrical doppleganger Liev Schreiber at the 2016 Academy Awards, where Spotlight won the Oscar for Best Picture.",
  "But on Sunday, April 23, two weeks before Trump’s termination of the embattled FBI director, the Comey epic that Baquet had envisioned six months earlier arrived in the form of a four-byline front-page blockbuster that is sure to be remembered as one of the Times’ most ambitious news features of 2017: “Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I.",

  "The Times charged hard—too hard, critics have argued—on the Hillary Clinton email controversy, as well as serving up a bombshell, based on pages obtained from Trump’s 1995 state tax returns, that strongly suggested Trump had used a loophole for the ultra-rich to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.",
  "As Steiger recalls, the New York Times “made a better offer.”\n\nWhen Baron was hired by then-executive editor Joe Lelyveld in 1996, the plan was that he would cycle through various departments, getting to know the editors and reporters in each before settling in as the Times’ night editor, if all went well.",
  "“We knocked heads quite a bit.”\n\nCollege exported Baron to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Baron was known to immerse himself in the bowels of the campus center, putting in countless hours at the biweekly Brown and White, of which he became editor in chief during his junior year.",
  "Many news organizations have been moving the needle on the Trump story in different ways—CNN, NBC News, the Wall Street Journal, POLITICO, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair and BuzzFeed, among others—whether through clean news breaks or relentless inside-the-room reporting on White House palace intrigue.",
  "So let’s get writers writing more frequently and in the newspaper more often.”\n\nWith Baquet, “the sweep of a story,” as yet another person who has worked with both men put it, is hugely important, and he’ll burrow in the weeds of a massive reporting project until it has been crafted to perfection.",
  "But it is also celebrating a Trump-fueled subscription surge over the past six months, including a record-shattering addition of 308,000 digital-only news subscribers from January to March, bringing the total count, seven years after the introduction of a paid online model, north of 2.2 million.",
  "With print advertising still plummeting, digital subscriptions are now the company’s most vital strategic pillar, as the Times courts new readers overseas and among millennials, with an ambitious goal of $800 million in total digital revenue by 2020, compared to around $442 million last year.",
  "Far from it, in the two years since Spotlight made him a nationally recognized name, Baron has established himself as journalism’s foremost defender, portraying without irony or equivocation the work of mainstream journalists as a constitutionally mandated corrective on excessive power.",
  "But Baron’s instincts didn’t betray him — the Globe’s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into endemic sexual abuse of children by priests, and a conspiracy of complicity within the Catholic hierarchy, went on to become one of the most celebrated journalistic crusades of modern times.",

  "Ibargüen said to him, facetiously, “Is this the part where Joe puts his arm around you and says, ‘Someday, my son, this could all be yours?’ ” Baquet laughed, but Ibargüen could read the writing on the wall—that was the last time they ever spoke about the Herald job.",

  "“You give him a newsroom consolidation, even if it’s hard, even if he doesn’t want to, he’ll get it done.” You might say Baron channeled his inner MBA, figuring out ways of doing more and more with less and less, a skill that endeared him to Times Company brass.",
  "The Post, meanwhile, has an army of around 750, with 17 foreign bureaus and an extensive freelancer network around the U.S. Baron got the green light to make dozens of hires in 2017, and a Post spokeswoman said the newsroom is projected to hit 800 by year’s end.",
