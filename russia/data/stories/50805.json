  "On Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily , Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney suggested the House and Senate “broaden the lens” of Russian conspiracy investigations to include “examples of collusion between U.S. government officials and Russian influence operations, including in our elections” under the Obama administration.",
  "I’ll have more flexibility after I’m re-elected in my last election.’”\n\n“I mean, criminy, that is as clear-cut an example as you can, and you’ve got the guy on video doing it, of collusion to interfere with our elections for the purposes of achieving an outcome that would suit and serve the Russians,” Gaffney exclaimed.",
  "Hillary Clinton engineered – with her husband, by the way – benefits for the Clinton Foundation that resulted in the transfer of immense amounts of technology to the Russians, in what was called the ‘Silicon Valley of Russia,’ Skolkovo,” he recalled.",
  "“We desperately need this fuller investigation to go forward, not as you say that of the Fake News.”\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",
  "Gaffney looked back to the infamous hot-mike moment of President Barack Obama “telling Vladimir Putin through an intermediary, ‘Just give me a little space in this election cycle, would ya, dude?",
  "“That ought to be front and center in these Senate and House hearings today, as well as one other that doesn’t get nearly enough attention: uranium and the Podesta boys.”\n\n“How about this?",
  "I hope he and his colleagues will.” he said, referring to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) of the House Intelligence Committee appearing on host Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program.",
  "“The U.S. Army and Air Force both concluded what this was was basically an overt technology theft operation, including of hypersonic missile technology.",
  "These ought to be part and parcel of the hearings.”\n\n“Trey Gowdy on Tucker last night seemed to suggest he wants to go there.",
  "Alex, these are high crimes and misdemeanors, it seems to me,” Gaffney told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.",
  "“There’s been scarcely any attention to them."
