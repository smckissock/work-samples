  "Meantime, we need to talk about…\n\nToxic Dividend #3: Kraft-Heinz (3.2% yield)\n\nKraft-Heinz: To see how the game has changed for food stocks like KHC, look no further than the closest supermarket: people are clearly craving more natural food and less processed fare.",
  "Which brings me to…\n\n2 Cheap Dividend Champs to Buy Now\n\nNow that we know what to keep out of our portfolio in 2018, let’s pivot to two dividend payers set to thrive as rates head higher, starting with one you really need to move on in the next couple days.",
  "Dividend Champ #1: Brookfield Property Partners (5.5% yield)\n\nI recommended Brookfield Property Partners, owner of malls, office towers, warehouses and apartments the world over, in a September article for 3 reasons:\n\nA healthy dividend (5.5% as I write).",
  "Toxic Dividend #2: Tupperware Brands (4.9% yield)\n\nTupperware Brands’ dividend yield has lurched to 4.9%, but that’s not because the plastic-container peddler just gave investors a fat raise—it’s because the stock cratered 13% over three days last week!",
  "Sure, Berkshire Hathaway is a major KHC shareholder, but that’s not enough to offset the company’s weak growth, ho-hum 3.2% yield and the very real chance payout growth will stall—if not reverse—knocking down the share price when it does.",
  "First, if you’ve followed my articles on Contrarian Outlook, you probably know what I’m going to say next: while a rise in rates may temporarily hit dividend payers, they’re actually a long-term plus because they signal a strong economy.",
  "That’s ridiculous for the company’s top-notch portfolio, which is throwing off high-single-digit growth in funds from operations (FFO, a better measure of BPY’s performance than EPS) and a soaring dividend payout!",
  "Dividend Champ #2: Ecolab (1.2% Yield)\n\nEcolab isn’t the sexiest company out there: it peddles water-treatment products, cleaners and lubricants, as well as services that help cut use of water and other resources.",
  "Toxic Dividend Stock #1: CenturyLink (12% yield)\n\nIf you need proof that dividend hounds are getting desperate, check out the beating CenturyLink shares have laid on the S&P 500 since January 1!",
  "Some Dividends Are Still Sucker’s Bets\n\nBut we still need to be careful, because some companies pay out more than they bring in through earnings per share (EPS) or free cash flow (FCF).",
  "The truth is, the 10-year Treasury yield’s recent run to 2.7%, a 13% rise since January 1, has tapped the brakes on the stock-market rally and hit high-yield plays like REITs hard.",
  "TUP’s Q4 earnings report left the herd cold: even though adjusted EPS jumped 10%, to $1.59, revenue fell 2%, meaning cost cuts, not sales growth, puffed up the bottom line.",
  "I’ll show you two dividend plays that should be high on your list shortly (including a bargain real estate play with a 5.5% yield and incredible dividend growth).",
  "That’s because the company can’t count on rising sales (revenue dropped 8% in the third quarter), EPS (down 39%) or FCF (down 41.4%) to backstop its dividend.",
  "Because BPY (technically a partnership, not a REIT) trades at 74% of book value (or what it would be worth if it were broken up and sold off today).",
  "One thing that could whack TUP’s earnings forecast is its high exposure to volatile emerging markets (and their currencies): around 67% of sales.",
  "That’s just too risky for my taste—especially when there are fast-growing (and safe) payouts available, like the two I’ll show you further on.",
  "And others are so hobbled by debt—and feeble growth—that even slightly higher rates could tip their payouts, and stock prices, over the cliff.",
  "No wonder the consumer-staples giant is showing the same pattern we saw with Tupperware: rising earnings propped up by cost cuts, not growth.",
  "Strong payout growth, with the dividend up 18% since BPY was spun off from Brookfield Asset Management in 2013; and Almost zero volatility.",
  "For one, steady demand for Ecolab’s products means the company is a free-cash-flow machine, with FCF more than doubling in the last decade!",
  "Management knows the score: they’re calling for 8% to 11% yearly FFO growth through 2021, and yearly dividend hikes of 5% to 8% to match.",
  "Which brings me to the dividend: in the last 12 months, Kraft-Heinz paid out a worrying 92% of earnings and 126% of FCF to shareholders!",
  "The company’s forecast was also bland: the midpoint of expected 2018 EPS, $4.58, was just 4% higher than the $4.41 TUP earned last year!",
  "While some double-digit paying dogs should be sold immediately, other dividend growers should be bought today for 25%+ upside in 2018.",
  "And don’t be fooled by that low dividend yield; it masks a payout that’s surged higher every single year for the last 25 years.",
  "And if TUP comes up short, a payout cut is definitely in play, given the 96% of FCF the dividend ate up in the last 12 months.",
  "Ecolab saw higher revenue across all three of its divisions—Global Energy, Global Industrial and Global Institutional—in Q3.",
  "It’s been proven over and over, including when REITs pummeled the market in the last rising-rate period, from 2004–06.",
  "Throw in a ridiculously low payout ratio of 33% of earnings (and 41% of FCF), and further dividend growth is a lock.",
  "No wonder it’s paying out a totally unsustainable 253% of trailing-twelve-month FCF and 373% of EPS as dividends!",
  "The average analyst estimate calls for EPS of $5.34 for 2018, up nearly 14% from a forecast $4.69 in 2017.",
  "And that, in turn, will drive more of the market-crushing share-price gains ECL shareholders love!",
  "And as I told you on January 23, CenturyLink’s payout is having a classic Wile E. Coyote moment.",
  "Don’t be taken in by CenturyLink’s eye-popping yield and deceptively cheap forward P/E of 13.",
  "Those payout hikes will continue, thanks to growing sales as the global economy takes off.",
  "And that way more than cancels out the higher borrowing costs these companies will face.",
  "With BPY’s next payout increase set to be announced February 8, the time to buy is now.",
  "It’s nearly doubled in the last 5 years alone, including a hefty 11% hike in December.",
  "If you hold high-yielders in your portfolio, you likely know what I’m talking about.",
  "It has clients in dozens of industries, from manufacturers to food makers.",
  "But if either so-called weakness keeps you away, you’re making a mistake.",
  "Wall Street thinks the party’s just starting, too, and for once, I agree.",
  "The stock’s yield is also a yawner for most dividend fans, at just 1.2%.",
  "In Q3, Kraft-Heinz’s sales dipped 1.7%, while adjusted EPS soared 15%.",
  "Then we’ll move on to those two dividend champs I mentioned earlier.",
  "Interest rates are soaring—so dividend stocks are yesterday’s news.",
  "This stock is cheap for a reason: its payout is on borrowed time.",
  "Besides, that disrespect is what’s behind our opportunity.",
  "That’s the absurd dividend yield this telecom stock pays.",
  "And Kraft-Heinz’s banners are way behind the curve.",
  "You can practically set your watch by this one!",
  "We’ll look at three of these toxic stocks now.",
  "There’s one number driving this pile-on: 12%.",
  "That’s just not enough to lift the dividend.",
  "(ECL reports Q4 earnings February 20).",
  "In fact, now is the time to buy.",
  "So should you be worried?",
  "Disclosure: none.",
  "The reason?",
  "Yes and no.",
  "My take?",
  "No way.",
  "Right?"
