  "The Department of Education sent a letter to the presidents of the University of Phoenix and Western International University — the two schools owned by Apollo Education Group US:APOL — Wednesday evening notifying the leaders that the agency would approve a proposed sale to a group of buyers led by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (no relation) if the company posted a letter of credit worth more than $385 million.",
  "If the sale is completed, the Department would also require that the schools submit to rigorous financial monitoring, submit monthly student rosters to the Department so the agency can monitor enrollment, commit to a recruiting strategy free of high-pressure tactics, such as making three or more unsolicited phone calls, in addition to other provisions.",
  "The Department will occasionally ask colleges that appear financially risky to post letters of credit to mitigate the risks to the Department while still allowing the school to participate in the federal financial aid program.",
  "The letter comes as the Obama administration looks to cement its legacy of heightened scrutiny on the for-profit college sector, which borrower advocates and investors are speculating may be undone in a new administration.",
  "“If investors were betting that the Education Department would rubber-stamp this deal, they bet wrong,” Rohit Chopra, the former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in an email.",
  "The proposed sale, which shareholders approved earlier this year, came amid steep enrollment declines at the University of Phoenix and subsequent turnaround efforts that were struggling to bear fruit.",
  "The Department has also taken action against specific colleges, which in some cases — including the high-profile collapse of ITT Technical Institutes — have pushed the schools to shut down.",
  "If the deal ultimately goes through, the chairman of the board of the schools’ new parent company would be Tony Miller, a former Deputy Secretary at the Department of Education.",
  "The $385 million letter of credit required by the Department to approve the sale, represents 25% of the federal financial aid funds the school received in the last fiscal year.",
  "Over the past several years, the Obama administration has pushed through regulations aimed at ensuring students at for-profit colleges are able to benefit from their degrees.",
  "In regulatory filings related to the deal, the buyers said the sale could be in jeopardy if the Department required the company to post a letter of credit in excess of 10%.",
  "Miller’s ties to the Obama administration raised eyebrows as the consortium of buyers began to lobby that same administration to approve the deal.",
  "The government pumped the brakes on a controversial proposed deal to take a public company that operates a major for-profit college private.",
  "Apollo Education Group said in a regulatory filing Thursday that the company had received the Department’s letter and was evaluating it.",
  "The substantial requirements under the letter of credit may give the new buyers leeway to back out of the deal if they choose.",
  "As of midday Thursday, shares of Apollo Education Group dropped about 2.21% since Wednesday’s close.",
