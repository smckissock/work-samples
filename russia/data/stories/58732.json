  "\"This series of events has left me feeling very skeptical and very alarmed, to be honest,\" said Turner, noting that FBI agents can have political views but they must be kept \"completely\" separate from the workplace and from their colleagues.",
  "In an Aug. 15, 2016, text message, Strzok wrote: “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office -- that there’s no way he gets elected -- but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.",

  "But speaking on \"Outnumbered,\" Turner called out the troubling nature of the messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were romantically involved.",
  "In an interview on Fox News, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders maintained that President Trump will not fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "Strzok worked on the Hillary Clinton email investigation and was removed from Robert Mueller's team over the summer when the messages surfaced.",
  "Though it has not been confirmed, \"Andy\" is a suspected reference to FBI deputy Andrew McCabe.",
