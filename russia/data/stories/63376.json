  "Senator John Thune of South Dakota said the following: “The Republican conference chairman, third-ranking party leader, he conceded that suspicion about what can be accomplished during the vote-a-rama is challenging leadership’s ability to whip enough votes to begin debate.” Basically to translate that out of Washington speak, rank-and-file Republican senators don’t believe their amendments will be taken seriously, because leadership somehow already has a deal to kill specific amendments in order not to disrupt the contours of this bill.",
  "CHUCK TODD: One of the things you were criticizing the Democrats back in 2010 during health care, you said the following, \"Americans have already seen and rejected the way Democrats bought their way to 60 votes in the Senate, including political payoffs such as the ‘Louisiana Purchase,’ the ‘Cornhusker Kickback’ and billions of dollars in ‘Gator Aid.’\"\n\nSenator, as you know this revised bill had a special carve-out for Alaska, had money that senators from West Virginia and Ohio wanted for the opioid fund.",
  "James Comey had a meeting with the president of the United States, where he took information about this private meeting with the president, put it on his government computer, went to his government office and decides, after he gets fired, to leak a conversation he had with the president of the United States to a friend of his to then leak it to a reporter.",
  "Look, this whole thing about if you're going towards conflating the Russia investigation with these allegations on obstruction, the position on that, and I've been on your broadcast a couple of times talking about this, the idea that the president of the United States fired James Comey cannot raise to the level of obstruction of justice.",
  "If your schedule is filled up 60 percent of the time with interview requests and meetings regarding Russia and other matters how much time do you personally have to dedicate to trying to consort and meet and resolve challenging issues like health care, tax reform and infrastructure.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Then on Tuesday with the New York Times ready to publish the email exchange Donald Trump Jr. tweets it himself including a June 3rd email offering, quote, \"Information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\"",
  "When the information -- as the information was to be released, a few days later, but as the information became public, our understanding is -- my understanding is -- that Donald Trump Jr. and his lawyer worked on a statement to make regarding the scope of the meeting.",
  "Can't reasonable conclude that because of what was said in that email between Donald Trump Jr. and Mr. Goldstone, the British publicist and what he claimed this was coming from the Russian, can't reasonable people say, \"That's enough to trigger an investigation.\"",
  "And one thing that's a real problem, Chuck, the fact that the president of the United States still refuses to unambiguously acknowledge that the Russians attacked us means that we have no whole of government approach on how we're going to deal with this problem.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, that’s mainly because all they hear is the critics, but the fact is we know millions of people are seeing sky-high premiums, unaffordable deductibles and fleeing insurance markets because insurance companies keep losing money.",
  "I think this bill has actually gotten much better as a result of the discussions we’ve had amongst ourselves and I think it’s something that once we agree to that we can sell to the American people as a better choice than the failures of Obamacare.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Well, I think what happens to this story as it unfolds there's no question but that the bungled handling of it, the lack of leadership, the tweets that have come out is taking away the precious gift that a president is given.",
  "Joining me for insight and analysis are NBC News special correspondent Tom Brokaw, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, former head of the American Conservative Union Al Cardenas, and Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute.",
  "And without the timelines, people always argue ‘We have so many facts in history, you need the facts,’ you have to know ‘if this, then that.’ But now it's up to us to interpret and figure out what's the connection between these facts.",
  "The president of the United States who's not responsible just for how his family behaves or what his last trip was, because of the health care debate and because of this Russian situation, no one is raising, once again, North Korea.",
  "That Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, a Russian lawyer, a lobbyist suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence, an interpreter and maybe others met at Trump Tower during the campaign to discuss dirt on Hillary Clinton.",
  "With regard to how the information came out, as I said, that was information that was controlled, not by my client, not by the president, it was controlled by Donald Trump Jr. and they made a decision on how to release that out.",
  "In one week we move from the White House and Trump Jr. denying ever having met with Russians, through a series of concessions and evolving explanations offered only after reporters had uncovered new facts, to where we are now.",
  "What we don't yet understand as conservatives is why the White House so reluctant to react as aggressively as they can to the cyber-attacks, to the bait and switch, you know, they bit, hook, line and sinker all these meetings.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD: When we come back much more on the Russia story including the critical timeline of the Trump Junior meeting right through the release of those DNC emails as part of the Democratic Convention in 2016.",
  "People are now understanding the benefits of this better care plan in terms of bringing down the price of health care and making it more available to more people as they can choose what they want at a price they can afford.",
  "This is hard, but we need to continue to work to make sure more people have access to medical care that they can afford, rather than this exercise of central planning and command-and-control, which has been a failure.",
  "And the part of that uniqueness was, we have to keep this in mind, it was a very detailed process, from a reportorial point of view and from a legal point of view about how the case was built brick by brick by brick.",
  "Former head of the American Conservative Union, Al Cardenas, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute and NBC News special correspondent Tom Brokaw.",
  "And that's when we get the first report that the Trump campaign essentially wants to water down or even gut a Republican Party platform statement that was anti-Russia when it comes to the issue of Ukraine.",
  "And so all of these denials from the president himself, to Donald Trump Jr., to Paul Manafort, all these denials were clearly false because they knew about this effort and they just failed to reveal it.",
  "I’m afraid if we don’t come to the rescue of those people that we will be left with our Democratic colleagues wanting to bail out through billions of dollars to insurance companies without any reform.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, health care is hard and we know what but we have no choice to try to come to the rescue of the millions of people who are being failed as a result of the problems of Obamacare.",
  "But can you explain why it took -- why it’s taken six days to continue to find out more people who were in this meeting, more discussions about those emails, why was all this trickled out like this?",
  "A new leader comes in, their responsibility is to set a tone for the country, to bring us to common action, to have an agenda, to mobilize the Congress, the public and the press behind their goals.",
  "What I laid out for you is, as your question was, as to the president, there's been no indication from special counsel or anyone else that the president is under investigation for anything here.",
  "Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard, \"The obvious question,\" picking really up on what Danny just said, \"If the meeting was a waste of time and a ‘nothing burger’ why lie after lie after lie?\"",
  "There’s a new Washington Post/ABC poll out this morning, essentially asking respondents “what do you prefer - keep Obamacare or the new Republican healthcare bill?” Two-to-one, keep Obamacare.",
  "Why -- it looks like a pattern of trying to at least - if not total cover it up, at least mislead or deceive...\n\nJAY SEKULOW: Well, look, you start with -- you use the phrase, Chuck, cover up.",
  "Which, by the way, is not unusual because days after, literally the next day or two, the same lawyer that has the Russia affiliation was down in Washington pitching the Magnitsky Act repeal.",
  "You’ve had lawyers on your broadcast and NBC’s had lawyers on their network and everybody’s coming to the same conclusion regarding the legality; there’s nothing illegal about that meeting.",
  "This is Russia taking very aggressive and sophisticated ways to both through espionage and cyberattacks and propaganda to undermine public confidence in our elections and our institutions.",
  "They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I've been hearing about but that were probably under-reported for, you know, years, not just during the campaign.",
  "I didn’t have that conversation and let me say this -- but I do want to be clear -- that the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: Well, Chuck, we don't really know because so far all of the Trump officials have conveniently forgotten about any meetings with Russians until they see evidence of it.",
  "The White House is still lobbying Republican governors hard, sending the vice president there, hoping their approval will help win over their own state's skeptical Republican senators.",
  "The point is it seems as if even conservative writers that were trying to give the president the benefit of the doubt, this is the week that they feel like they can't give it to him.",
  "I want to sort of seed this conversation with this following little comp that we put together that now seems totally inoperative when it comes to the Russians and President Trump.",
  "One of the things that raised a yellow flag in my eye was the fact that Senator McConnell didn’t seem to commit that we’re going to begin debate as soon as Senator McCain is back.",
  "How do you refer to something as a hoax, when you have an email like this, with Donald Trump Jr. saying “I love it” when he finds out there’s information coming from the Russians?",
  "Nothing has changed since not only when I was here but nothing has changed since when James Comey told the president he was not under investigation on three different occasions.",
  "The point is somebody from the other side of the aisle could easily say, “you guys are doing the same thing.” You have redesigned the bill specifically to get wavering votes.",

  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: --I understand the president's frustration when James Comey told him three times he's not the target of an investigation and he wants that made public.",
  "To those who remember Watergate the seminal moment may have been when White House counsel John Dean said he'd told President Nixon there was a cancer on the presidency.",
  "July 27th, five days later, in what became his final press conference as a presidential candidate, then nominee Donald Trump says this about Hillary Clinton's emails.",
  "And, yes, unfortunately, it has become a partisan issue and our democratic friends are refusing to lift a finger to help their very constituents who are being hurt.",
  "TOM BROKAW: And if he continued to say that in public I wonder what his son was thinking at the time or Paul Manafort was thinking at the time watching all of that.",
  "So he has a mandate, as you saw, where everybody knows the mandate that came from the Department of Justice to look at Russia engagement in the electoral campaigns.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Let me start with this - let’s try to clear this up - as best as you can - do you know for sure everyone who was at that meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?",
  "And this president is entangling himself in that kind of discussion that we're having here today when it's not in the interest of anyone, most of all this country.",
  "The fact is this information has now come to light and all of these efforts to say there was only smoke and there's no fire, well, that's all been put to rest.",
  "Matter of fact, we still don't know for sure how many people were in this meeting that we've been talking about, there's at least six but there could be more.",
  "But I think Republicans have made repeated promises in elections leading up to now, that we would and we could do better and I believe that we will do better.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Later that Sunday the New York Times reports that Donald Trump Jr. took the meeting after being promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.",
  "A year ago senior members of the Trump campaign knew that there was a Russian government effort to try to intervene to help Mr. Trump hurt Hillary Clinton.",
  "Think about the time that we lost between the time of Monica Lewinsky's first allegations and Clinton's final acquittal by the Senate - 11, 12, 13 months.",
  "Can you say, with 100 percent conviction, that you’re going to begin the debate and get this bill on the floor when Senator McCain returns to Washington?",
  "And again, the meeting and what took place at the meeting based on all the information that you just said is not a violation of any law, statute or code.",

  "Of course, he’s the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I began by asking him when he first learned about the Trump Jr. meeting.",
  "But I believe we're making great progress as a result of the good work of the administration, particularly CMS administrator Seema Verma and Dr. Price.",
  "And again, as the lawyer, Chuck, and you have to understand this, as the lawyer, I look at what would-- you say doesn't this trigger an investigation.",
  "NBC learns that in addition to the Kremlin-connected lawyer, a former counter-intelligence officer turned lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, was also there.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Can you tell me about the reports that the president was involved in the initial response that Donald Trump Jr. gave the New York Times.",
  "That man loves his family and he protects them even when they don't need protecting and complicates their lives, not to speak of his own leadership.",
  "But there's two members of the Intel Committee that have given conflicting statements about whether you guys knew of the existence of this meeting.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I mean, on the contrary he just said the other day, \"I'll be very angry with them if the Senate doesn't come up with a bill.\"",
  "Al, on one end you can look at these numbers and say, \"Okay, in the places that helped get Donald Trump elected he's doing better than overall.\"",
  "What was stunning to me is why the president has not called in all of the principals in all this and said I want this out of the way right now.",
  "But certainly there are atmospherics here that call to mind Watergate, the kind of denial of the obvious and the petty lying that is going on.",
  "But what there is an attempt to try to accommodate the concerns of those states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and those that did not.",
  "But are there parts of this investigation that the Intel Committee just doesn't have the resources to do that they need to farm out to others?",
  "This is the first time the public is now seeing in black and white, there's no effort to disguise, that there was a Russian government effort.",
  "And the scope of the meeting -- what was discussed at the meeting -- actually ended up being more about the Magnitsky Act than anything else.",
  "This is going to be an open process where anybody, on the Democratic side or Republican side, can offer an amendment and it will get a vote.",
  "Rich Lowry, \"The way this story has unfolded with Don Junior's highly misleading accounts raises the prospect that it's something worse.\"",

  "AL CARDENAS: President usually gets a list of people in his party whose districts he needs to visit and sell on a particular key matter.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: And also you think about the fact that he hasn't expanded his base beyond these voters that were already for him.",
  "But we'd like to look at the timeline of both June and July of 2016 now that we know about this meeting that took place at Trump Tower.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, the president said he became aware of it very recently, right before this came out, and that’s when he was notified.",
  "CHUCK TODD: And what's your understanding of what Special Counsel Bob Mueller is investigating if he's not investigating the president?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: And that he is--\n\nCHUCK TODD: But what I understand--\n\nJAY SEKULOW: Well, it's an article two power of the constitution.",
  "*** COMMERCIAL BREAK ***\n\nCHUCK TODD: Welcome back, the path to passing the Republican health care bill may run through State houses.",
  "But yes, I believe that as soon as we have a full contingent of Senators that we’ll have that vote and it’s important that we do so.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: Well, look, what do the American people dislike when they look at this, Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr., and there are more.",
  "CHUCK TODD: And one last question here, the president, once again this morning, is tweeting that the Russia investigation is a hoax.",
  "I could have never though predicted that the president would have fired Jim Comey and we would've had all the time we spent on that.",
  "Or do you need to do more evidence gathering before you bring Jared Kushner before the committee, Donald Trump Jr. or Paul Manafort?",
  "We want to talk to Donald Trump Jr. We obviously want to talk to Mr. Manafort who had a history of dealing with pro-Russian forces.",
  "We're just starting to talk to all these individuals who were involved with the Trump campaign who have had contacts with Russians.",
  "And if I'm the White House and I'm going go with executive branch to the legislature and say, \"Hey, there's got to be consequences.",
  "It's my understanding that most of the secretaries of state have not even been briefed on whether their states were hacked or not.",
  "CHUCK TODD: How many other meetings because of updated forms, say, by Jared Kushner and others do you want to know the details of?",
  "And the journalists are the first rough draft of history for all of us and the story they are telling now, it’s really important.",
  "And at some point from a political point of view however enthusiastic they may be about the man that's going to catch up to them.",
  "We have been limited so much in terms of the time capabilities to really have serious conversations about the issues of the day.",
  "And then from there of course Russian interference seemed to continue through election day, the Podesta emails and there you go.",
  "Because I think we all get, we’re so event driven even on this Russian investigation, where does it all fit in the big picture.",
  "But what I don't want to happen is for us to just do a multi-billion dollar bailout of insurance companies without any reforms.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Does calling it--\n\nSEN. JOHN CORNYN: But I understand the--\n\nCHUCK TODD: --but does call it a hoax undermine trust?",
  "And there seems to be a disconnect about our feelings towards Russia and their motives and what the White House is portraying.",
  "And I go back to the other statement, Chuck, and that is, again, the meeting, in and of itself, of course, not an illegal act.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: No, I mean, I can’t say whether the president was told the statement was going to be coming from his son on that.",
  "That it was, in fact, from him and I believe it was his lawyer was in consultation -- I’m sure his lawyer was in consultation.",
  "If you're wondering where these counties are, in the state of Florida it's any county that basically doesn't touch salt water.",
  "So again, I raise that question, by the way, with former Director Comey because that's the basis upon which all that started.",
  "CHUCK TODD: So you just--\n\nSEN. JOHN CORNYN: Chuck, there’s isn’t a Republican bill that’s been agreed to by all 50 senators.",
  "NBC News - Meet The Press\n\n\"7.16.17\"\n\nCHUCK TODD: This Sunday the drip, drip, drip of Team Trump's meeting with the Russians.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, first of all Chuck, we all wish John McCain a speedy recovery and we need him in more ways than one.",
  "CHUCK TODD: When you were here in June you said that you were adamant that the president himself is not under investigation.",
  "But here's what we know right now, the Trump team was open to getting information from Russians and willing to cover it up.",
  "And everybody has said, and I think you will admit that, there is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.",
  "AL CARDENAS: Yeah, it's a common denominator here eliminates from the fact of how we, as conservatives, feel about Russia.",
  "But what people fail to appreciate enough I think about Donald Trump is that there's really one thing he cares about most.",
  "But at some point if Democrats won't participate in the process then we're going to have to come up with a different plan.",
  "Story number two, a meeting did occur with a Russian person, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort all attend.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD: Joining me now is President Trump’s attorney -- one of President Trump’s attorneys -- Jay Sekulow.",
  "I think the president used the term “recently” or “relatively recently.” It was in days before leading up to this matter.",
  "director, which he has appropriate-- and James Comey testified, Chuck, under oath, that he had the authority to fire him.",
  "I'll ask President Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow and the leading Democrat in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.",
  "So the thing about this investigation is it feels like almost every week we find another thread that we have to pull on.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Let me ask you this final question, is there a difference, in your mind, between collusion and coordination?",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, I think it's a mistake to personalize this to President Trump or Hillary Clinton or anyone else.",
  "You need those public opinion numbers high especially in the areas where you've got to get the members to vote with you.",
  "And if you look at the electoral map and you look where these senators are, those numbers are not where they need to be.",
  "We're willing to do what we can to shore up the system now to stabilize it to make health care available to people now.",
  "CHUCK TODD: One of the issues you have to get this to the floor to start debate is trust with Republican rank-and-file.",
  "Obviously this bill is a tough bill for -- I would say -- at least a dozen senators to vote for on your side of aisle.",
  "CHUCK TODD: That's 56 days between that press conference and that first email that we now know about from Goldstone.",
  "Now, let's fast-forward a few weeks to the start of the conventions, Republican and Democratic National Conventions.",
  "We want to show if clearly the Russians dealt with a number of individuals, senior officials, in the Trump campaign.",
  "The meeting's broker, publicist Rob Goldstone, adding, \"This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information.",
  "The gap between the original story Donald Trump Jr. told and what we have learned to be the truth grows by the day.",
  "And he explains that the information is, quote, \"Part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump,\" unquote.",
  "In my state alone, 600,000 low-income Texans will get access to private insurance which they don’t currently have.",
  "Some say it was a threat, but Senator McConnell has said it means you're going to have to work with the Democrats.",

  "CHUCK TODD: Well, and the different between those surge and flip voters, I think the surge voters will defend him.",
  "July 22nd, the day after the Republican Convention ends, WikiLeaks publishes its first dump of stolen DNC emails.",
  "There's enormous concern in the national security and foreign policy area about how that has just been set aside.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: No, I don’t represent Donald Trump Jr. and I do not know everyone for sure that was at that meeting.",
  "That was information that either Donald Trump Jr. had or the campaign had or wherever the information was stored.",
  "Why is the White House so reluctant to come clean and how much did President Trump know about the meeting before?",
  "Has it come to the point where the scope of what your initial investigation was-- obviously it needs to broaden.",
  "Illegally leaked information that was a conversation of the president of the United States with the, then-F.B.I.",
  "CHUCK TODD: You know, what does it say that you needed that one vote just simply to bring the bill to the floor?",
  "And that as a result of not being able to travel to Washington this coming week the Senate will delay its vote.",
  "The best way to figure out how significant that Trump Jr. meeting was or was not may be to follow the timeline.",
  "Look, to push this stuff in a Congress that's so close in terms of votes, you need high public opinion numbers.",
  "But we believe we have the resources and the charge to get all this information and then to try to get it out.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: I am sitting in the oval office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD: All week long, revelations render the administration's previous statement inoperative.",
  "(START TAPE)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: I know, Chuck, there are other committees that want to rush and bring these individuals in.",
  "He is the man whose job it is to find 50 Republicans to vote yes, and send this bill to the president’s desk.",
  "And many of the Democratic governors and a few Republican governors expressed strong opposition to the bill.",
  "And I think that's what the country deserves in this case is to go about it and not to entangle the two yet.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.",
  "KELLYANNE CONWAY: The comments they were making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague.",
  "And I think that raises very serious legal issues as to the scope and nature of what really can take place.",
  "ANNOUNCER: You can see more End Game and Post Game sponsored by Boeing on the Meet the Press Facebook page.",
  "Also on June 7th, remember the meeting with the Russian lawyer is already on the books for two days later.",
  "And increasingly what we in Washington now see is that the president doesn't spend a lot of time thinking.",
  "Well, wait a minute, Mr. President, or dad, there's a meeting that we probably ought to make you aware of.",
  "But is that not--\n\nJAY SEKULOW: Well, if there's not an--\n\nCHUCK TODD: --a trigger for an investigation?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: So I read those reports as well and the president was not -- did not -- draft the response.",
  "Sometimes you see on these forms they met with so and so but you don't know the details of the meeting.",
  "Everything that happens regarding Russia and the United States has a structure and an approval process.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: There is no question that timelines are the foundation of what we do in history.",
  "At this point, can’t reasonable people conclude that this meeting is enough to begin an investigation?",
  "Where's the conversation about pushing the agenda and getting through the home stretch of health care?",
  "Nobody--\n\nFEMALE CORRESPONDENT: So you're not aware of any contact during the course of the election.",
  "You know, Russia has succeeded way beyond their dreams with respect to the disruption they've caused.",
  "Where is that special compact between a president and the leader that is going to lead them forward?",
  "That meeting with this lady who was accompanied by someone else, that meeting was known to be there.",
  "June 15th, very next day, it's Russia-linked hacker Guccifer 2.0 who claims credit for the DNC hack.",
  "The timeline now, so important, not just to organize yourself, but the timeline now may be evidence.",
  "SEN. JOHN McCAIN: It's serious and this is a serious situation and one that is a long way from over.",
  "This is clearly brings the investigation to a new level and makes our effort all the more important.",
  "So the basis upon which this entire special counsel investigation is taking place is based on what?",
  "How about doing a rally in West Virginia that might pull a little pressure on Shelley Moore Capito.",
  "We did a separate survey that we're going to use and we're going to track over the next four years.",
  "But we do get the first reports that Russian hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee.",
  "Where all these conversations fall, that will be something we'll try to reach some conclusions on.",
  "And we have no notification of any investigation going on with the president of the United States.",
  "I mean that’s a -- is that a concern to you that you’re not getting all the information you need?",
  "(BEGIN TAPE)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week.",
  "It comes up, the president says, \"I'm going to deal with that,\" and then it goes away in a hurry.",
  "Well, what are we doing to convince those voters that that member needs to vote in a certain way?",
  "Story number one, there were no contacts with Russians and the Putin regime during the campaign.",
  "We know that Jared Kushner who said he had no meetings with Russians has now had three meetings.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: Chuck, all I can tell you is we don't share what we know and when we knew it.",
  "CHUCK TODD: But last Saturday the New York Times reports there was a meeting on June 9th, 2016.",
  "And with each new piece of evidence the White House is forced to revise and extend its remarks.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting.",
  "And I’ve said this before and I’d appreciate the opportunity to be very clear on this with you.",
  "AL CARDENAS: In other words, Chuck, the most significant aspect of outcome is member schedules.",
  "These are places where Donald Trump improved dramatically on Mitt Romney's performance in 2012.",
  "And I think it's time for presidential leadership to say, \"I want to get this out of the way.\"",
  "Was he asked to read the statement before it was given to the New York Times on Air Force One?",
  "(START TAPE)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man.",
  "Let's take you at your word and the leak that James Comey, you know, leaking the conversation.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: Listen, I'm going to leave the legal questions to Bob Mueller and his team.",
  "But we also want to make sure that we're prepared for when the Russians will be back in 2018.",
  "So that is where that statement -- again, I think it’s important to understand what this was.",
  "I think you used a key word though, Tom, you said, \"I wonder what the president is thinking.\"",
  "Do you accept the idea that there’s a lot of suspicion among Republican senators about this?",
  "That would not have been information that the president of the United States would have had.",
  "And this was really, as the president said, right before the whole issue started developing.",
  "The response came from Donald Trump Jr. and -- I’m sure -- in consultation with his lawyer.",
  "And we've seen the results of that, the national security advisor, General Flynn was fired.",
  "And we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.",
  "You know, they're just banging around in this arena of some kind, slamming into each other.",
  "If you're wondering what kind of counties are those think Macomb in Michigan, for instance.",

  "JAY SEKULOW: I think, you know, I'm not going to speculate as to what he's investigating.",
  "For the sole purpose of obtaining a special counsel which was appointed a few days later.",
  "But they keep just hitting at the balls that come at them rather than having a narrative.",
  "Then we can figure out were these events just facts or did they have a causal connection.",
  "One of my goals with that last segment was simply to try to put some of this in context.",
  "What does it say that one missing Republican could actually upset the entire apple cart?",
  "What the president and his team do is that they handle every little bit as it comes out.",
  "REPORTER: So as far as you know, as far as this incident's concerned, this is all of it.",
  "So I think there’s uncertainty about what the final outcome will be, I understand that.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: It does sort of tries to pull the thread I think on this Russia stuff.",
  "We did something a little bit different with our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.",
  "President right now, he's doing well in these areas, 56 percent in the surge counties.",
  "When we come back, how do people in Trump country feel about the president these days?",
  "That's the first email that is sent to Donald Trump Junior by publicist Rob Goldstone.",
  "It is so precarious that Republicans needed McCain's yes vote to simply begin debate.",
  "And not only were the Trump senior campaign officials, you know, having this meeting.",
  "Why he felt so engaged by Putin in the first place always befuddled me a little bit.",
  "If there's an investigation you're looking at what law may have been violated here.",
  "James Lankford of Oklahoma, Republican, said you knew the existence of the meeting.",
  "But do you believe there's a difference between collusion and simply coordination?",
  "And then we will leave it up to the American people to draw their own conclusions.",
  "CHUCK TODD: But the vote is now delayed because of a health scare for John McCain.",
  "CHUCK TODD: You were very careful to say the president didn’t draft the statement.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: We don’t represent Donald Trump Jr. We don’t represent the campaign.",
  "CHUCK TODD: The president once again has referred to this Russia story as a hoax.",
  "But I would say this meeting is very significant in terms of all that's happened.",
  "We've got health care hanging out there, we've got North Korea hanging out there.",
  "Al, it seems like a lot of conservative writers this week, this news turned them.",
  "And our latest numbers on what voters in Trump country think about the president.",
  "The flip voters, they were voting against Hillary Clinton and the establishment.",
  "In that email, Goldstone promises the younger Mr. Trump dirt on Hillary Clinton.",
  "But the biggest problem with the Trump administration is there isn't any thread.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, if we're not successful now I assume we'll keep trying.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: There is no collusion between circling myself and my campaign.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Tom, you were our chief White House correspondent during Watergate.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Earlier this morning, I spoke with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Over the course of seven days a head snapping series of statements.",
  "Over the next three days the number of participants in this meeting multiplies.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Yeah, but--\n\nCHUCK TODD: No I asked you about the specific email.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD: Tom Brokaw, we don't have the answer yet on collusion.",
  "CHUCK TODD: And Danielle, his lawyer said, \"I'm not Donald Trump Jr.’s lawyer.",
  "Then there are the counties that flipped from President Obama to Donald Trump.",
  "We talked to voters in different areas who helped fuel Donald Trump's victory.",
  "And you've had a lot of people on this network saying exactly the same thing.",
  "Clearly the people from the Trump campaign welcomed that kind of involvement.",
  "And this one keeps dribbling out in a way that is really destructive to him.",
  "I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.",
  "The fact is for seven years Republican Party said, \"Obamacare is a disaster.",
  "But now we have a piece of evidence that is the there is there potentially.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Does Jared Kushner-- should he leave the White House right now?",
  "FEMALE CORRESPONDENT: Can you just--\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Russia is a rouse.",
  "He can't drown out the Russia story because he's not doing anything else.",
  "Lots of reports about how hard it is for women to work in Silicon Valley.",
  "CHUCK TODD: All right, another double down, tripled down, quadruple down.",
  "That's been the entire theme of our conversation, the lack of leadership.",
  "Just 44 percent in these, quote, flip-counties approve of the president.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, what was the president's action that's not honorable?",
  "What did the president do in the context of this that was not honorable?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: By the way --\n\nCHUCK TODD: Why did you only find out then?",
  "There’s no way that anybody can block it or prevent them from doing so.",
  "We've already lost six months and this doesn't show anything of ending.",
  "But at the same time, Watergate, I like to think, was there by itself.",
  "Will the latest vote delay help or hurt the Republican bill's chances?",
  "We've talking a lot this morning about the timeline of this past week.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD: June 9th, the meeting happens at Trump Tower.",
  "June 14th, five days later, no speech from the president, by the way.",
  "One of the latest from an intriguing new survey that we've conducted.",
  "That's tonight on Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly at 7:00 p.m. eastern.",
  "And what do voters in Trump country think of the president right now?",
  "But they were anxious to have it and anxious to get this information.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Now I understand you said you didn't want to get into it.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Look, this investigation feels as if it grows by the day.",
  "And I don't think Democrats want to change anything about Obamacare.",
  "It's stopping everything we are trying to get done in this country.",
  "What do you see today that looks like the same and looks different?",
  "CHUCK TODD: Now you said you need to talk to all these individuals.",
  "The latest from a special new NBC News/ Wall Street Journal survey.",
  "This appears to be the week that the Russia story has metastasized.",
  "You've got to get public opinion in that district to side with you.",
  "Combine the two groups, 50 percent approve, 40 percent disapprove.",
  "And he hasn't gone to those states where they didn't vote for him.",
  "I want you to fess up to what happened we need to close this down.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?",
  "When we have so many issues before us it's got to get cleaned up.",
  "That void is what's getting the conservative movement up in arms.",
  "CHUCK TODD: You got a lot of work to do with the American people.",
  "And obviously journalists are writing the first draft of history.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Donald Trump Jr. promises the whole story is now out.",
  "DONALD TRUMP JR.: I'm more than happy to be transparent about it.",
  "director and one of the motivations was the Russia investigation.",
  "TOM BROKAW: The fact is, Chuck, there's a burning fuse out there.",
  "But I could argue 56 percent is not a good number in those areas.",
  "And it could undermine a lot of the support you're seeing there.",
  "CHUCK TODD: All right, Jay Sekulow, I'm going to leave it there.",
  "I'll talk to the man who counts the votes, John Cornyn of Texas.",
  "The president wasn’t aware of the meeting and did not attend it.",
  "CHUCK TODD: When did the president become aware of this meeting?",
  "CHUCK TODD: You keep saying you don’t represent Donald Trump Jr.",
  "CHUCK TODD: If this health care bill does not pass, what's next?",
  "I'm part of the Intelligence Committee along with Mark Warner.",
  "Appreciate you coming on and hopefully we'll talk to you soon.",
  "*** COMMERCIAL BREAK ***\n\nCHUCK TODD: Back now with the panel.",
  "Why does that make the president's actions any more honorable?",
  "I take you at your word that there's no illegal act there yet.",
  "July 18th, that's the first day of the Republican Convention.",
  "It's a very serious matter that needs thorough investigation.",
  "One thing we know about the Russians, there's no freelancing.",
  "And it's hurting the president more than I think he realizes.",
  "Anyway, we're out of time, space time continuum got us again.",
  "Go get some more honey in that tea that you've got to drink.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Well, they don’t like what they’ve heard so far.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Mr. Sekulow, I didn't ask you about James Comey.",
  "He made that very clear when he was on air talking about it.",
  "I think it's very important that we get the documents first.",
  "So, in that sense, we didn’t have access to the information.",
  "To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.",
  "Simple opposition research, as President Trump has claimed?",
  "CHUCK TODD: Well, he fired-- he said he fired -- the F.B.I.",
  "I came in saying I was going to be a very strong president.",
  "The one thing we can all be persuaded of is they are liars.",
  "Now I'm not persuaded that there's a lot of collusion here.",
  "You've got Russia coming up and some health care coming up.",
  "***COMMERCIAL BREAK***\n\nCHUCK TODD: Back now with End Game.",
  "I'm not even persuaded there's a lot of coordination here.",
  "This is about Russia versus the United States, in my view.",
  "He's not done the things that you do to get a bill passed.",
  "Roy Blunt told me that he did not know about this meeting.",
  "So that’s what I can tell you because that’s what we know.",
  "And some Republicans in Capitol Hill are losing patience.",
  "I'm only going to speak for the president at this point.\"",
  "(START TAPE)\n\nFEMALE CORRESPONDENT: During the election.",
  "And I noticed that he's made it on every single network.",
  "The nation's governors met this weekend in Rhode Island.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: There's no state specific relief here.",
  "But is part of Russia and its government support for Mr.",
  "That's the responsibility of Special Prosecutor Mueller.",
  "We've been trying to go about this in a methodical way.",
  "And the president doesn't spend a lot of time planning.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think the whole concept of it.",
  "You have to bring people and heal this nation together.",
  "And that's the states where the numbers need to be up.",
  "CHUCK TODD: All right, I'm going to take a pause here.",
  "So what we are doing is offering a better alternative.",
  "And it tells the country that they have a lot to hide.",
  "CHUCK TODD: And it's not just Democrats speaking out.",
  "I'm going to Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas.",
  "For example, DHS has indicated 21 states were hacked.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Nobody said he didn't have the authority.",
  "Trump Jr. responds, \"If it's what you say, I love it.",
  "DONALD TRUMP JR.: For me this is opposition research.",
  "The president doesn’t have control of data like that.",
  "Those last five or six votes are so hard to get, man.",
  "They're waiting for the Republicans to do something.",
  "And, again, the president’s been very clear on that.",
  "He has the authority to fire James Comey and he did.",
  "And I think it's important to have the full context.",
  "Mr. Sekulow, thanks for coming on to Meet the Press.",
  "His lawyers are probably giving him advice to leave.",
  "Senator John Cornyn of Texas is the Republican whip.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Well, I would call it uncertainty.",
  "***COMMERCIAL BREAK***\n\nCHUCK TODD: And we are back.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah, that's a sports analogy.",
  "So I think it’s really important to understand that.",
  "You know what, president, no speech about the bill?",
  "There is no construct for dealing with North Korea.",
  "We want to know the contents of all those meetings.",
  "And I'm more than happy to cooperate with everyone.",
  "It was a meeting apparently about Russian adoption.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Russia.",
  "Did the president get a heads up on the statement?",
  "We're not trying to re-litigate the 2016 election.",
  "TOM BROKAW: We also have to put this in a context.",
  "And that's why I said earlier that Russia has won.",
  "They have disrupted America's legislative process.",
  "I don't have a sports analogy here for you, Chuck.",
  "First time it's in public that we know about this.",
  "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: These guys just can't come clean.",
  "And remember, if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.",
  "***COMMERCIAL BREAK***\n\nCHUCK TODD: Welcome back.",
  "But I can only speak for myself and the Russians.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Doris, what do you make of all this?",
  "You asked a full question, I gave a full answer.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. said he cooperate with anybody.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, here’s the problem with this.",
  "The president was not involved in that decision.",
  "His lawyers talked to him about it right before.",
  "To be sure, there are many unanswered questions.",
  "Will the delay help or hurt the bill's chances?",
  "Our lawyers were not involved in that decision.",
  "And that's exactly what we're going to do next.",
  "And then they end up like kids in a bumper car.",
  "And we don't know how that's going to turn out.",
  "And it could blow up into Donald Trump's face.",
  "And we are going to get to the bottom of this.",
  "The president said this in his victory speech.",
  "Senator Cornyn, welcome back to the show, sir.",
  "Nepotism is not really a great American thing.",
  "Thank you for coming on, I appreciate it, sir.",
  "And that to me is problematic from the outset.",
  "And then I think we'll have a lot more to say.",
  "It feels like it metastasized a bit this week.",
  "SEN. JOHN McCAIN: This is a serious situation.",
  "What we want to show collusion, coordination.",
  "And Donald Trump Jr. has said the same thing.",
  "And after about 20 minutes the meeting ended.",
  "And then there's the battle over health care.",
  "TOM BROKAW: I really am reluctant to do that.",
  "But it’s inherent in the legislative process.",
  "And we don't know how it's going to turn out.",
  "That--\n\nDANIELLE PLETKA: And they're waiting.",
  "How about let's just look at health care, Al.",
  "They approve of the president's performance.",
  "You're an ex-officio of the Intel Committee.",
  "Mr. Sekulow, welcome back to Meet the Press.",
  "REINCE PRIEBUS: It was a very short meeting.",
  "We have a counterintelligence investigation.",
  "Sorry about the voice this morning as well.",
  "The attorney general had to recuse himself.",
  "Is the committee ready to talk to them now?",
  "CHUCK TODD: Enjoy the rest of your weekend.",
  "CHUCK TODD: When did you find out about it?",
  "You're very involved in this investigation.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Well, you guys talk about that.",
  "TOM BROKAW: I thought Watergate was unique.",
  "PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, nobody that I know of.",
  "There was an approval process, a structure.",
  "First in what we're calling surge counties.",
  "A little twist on Data Download this week.",
  "And the president was not at that meeting.",
  "But there was nothing illegal to cover up.",
  "Not even in regard to this single meeting.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Is that still operative today?",
  "CHUCK TODD: What happened at that meeting?",
  "Can you at least shed some light on that?",
  "Our job is not to find criminal behavior.",
  "After the break back to the Russia story.",
  "They just want to throw more money at it.",
  "And yet we've got a nine-month narrative.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Let me start with the delay.",
  "But we want reforms to go along with it.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Call me Jay anytime, Chuck.",
  "I haven't discussed this issue with him.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: He said he fired the F.B.I.",
  "We don’t have control of data like that.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: He's part of them.",
  "You've got to go to people's districts.",
  "That's a good way of thinking about it.",
  "Others exited the meeting very quickly.",
  "Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.",
  "CHUCK TODD: That was a pretty good one.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Thanks, thanks Chuck.",
  "That it's not a good time to be there.",
  "But he probably doesn't want to leave.",
  "We're talking about leadership before.",
  "CHUCK TODD: All right, Senator Cornyn.",
  "But this is not about President Trump.",
  "And, you know, there's no basis to it.",
  "In fact, almost exactly the same time.",
  "You don't have to call me Mr. Sekulow.",
  "We want to know what happened in 2016.",
  "AL CARDENAS: Well, you can argue that.",
  "There are three things you need to do.",
  "How many of those meetings are there?",
  "And he's also on the Intel Committee.",
  "Listen, I wish we were further along.",
  "I asked you about the specific email.",
  "So that’s really what this was about.",
  "DONALD TRUMP JR.: This is everything.",
  "And that's the hard task ahead of us.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: I know there is one.",
  "But they're losing the politics here.",
  "Also the Republican health care bill.",
  "We'll have more on this story later.",
  "CHUCK TODD: No that was pretty good.",
  "CHUCK TODD: But it isn't everything.",
  "I was not involved in that decision.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, here's the thing.",
  "We need to have those conversations.",
  "Get us in office, we'll improve it.\"",
  "That's got to be a concerted effort.",
  "Thanks to all of you for joining us.",
  "We want to see how extensive it is.",
  "And there was a translator present.",
  "So I think I wanted to hear it out.",
  "CHUCK TODD: That's all right, Dany.",
  "So let's break it all down by date.",
  "And so we know Russia's motivation.",
  "So he's clearly thought about this.",
  "They won't stop lying about things.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: Thank you, Chuck.",
  "CHUCK TODD: That's a strong thing.",
  "Is it coincidence or is it causal.",
  "Treason, as some Democrats charge?",
  "And that's very, very significant.",
  "I haven't talked with Bob Mueller.",
  "It's not an insignificant matter.",
  "Tuesday night, story number four.",
  "Did he sign off on the statement?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: About the same time.",
  "But I just don't know what it is.",
  "I mean, you can't lead like that.",
  "That's how you pressure a member.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: We did it.",
  "Look, we have offices in Moscow.",
  "Peggy Noonan, \"Was it collusion?",
  "And I want the consequences now.",
  "I can tell you he was not there.",
  "Especially later in the summer.\"",
  "It's called opposition research.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Good Sunday morning.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Sharing your views.",
  "That's a critical part of this.",
  "All right, back in 45 seconds.",
  "CHUCK TODD: I understand that.",
  "We represent global companies.",
  "And they don't have an agenda.",
  "\"I'm not Don Junior's lawyer.",
  "And I want them spelled out.\"",
  "It's not even the Trump name.",
  "Our job is to find the facts.",
  "It came from Donald Trump Jr.",
  "That is a decision they made.",
  "He doesn't reach out to them.",
  "I think we can cover it all.",
  "Time you can never get back.",
  "And then you’ll get a story.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN: Thank you.",
  "I'm going to leave it there.",
  "One is a long way from over.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: Thank God.",
  "But Senate health care 3.0.",
  "And that creates a tension.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Thanks, Chuck.",
  "We represent the president.",
  "PAUL MANAFORT: It's absurd.",
  "But really it went nowhere.",
  "And that was the end of it.",
  "Just 40 percent disapprove.",
  "You've got to work it hard.",
  "You've got to be resilient.",
  "* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",
  "And that’s important here.",
  "Those kind of information.",
  "We've made those requests.",
  "And whole bunch of people.",
  "It's a very complex issue.",
  "Let's start with June 3rd.",
  "You accept that criticism?",
  "That represents progress.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: Oh yeah.",
  "CHUCK TODD: I understand.",
  "Don't ask me about that.\"",
  "We are working in tandem.",
  "CHUCK TODD: I understand.",
  "But we're still early on.",
  "Five, six, ten, a couple?",
  "That’s a big word to use.",
  "DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: We.",
  "Let’s be realistic here.",
  "That isn’t what I asked.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Fair enough.",
  "That's a legal argument.",
  "TOM BROKAW: I really am.",
  "What do you say to that?",
  "Is the comparison fair?",
  "Time, energy and focus.",
  "Does it have the votes?",
  "CHUCK TODD: You got it.",
  "There's no freelancing.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: All right.",
  "So he has that mandate.",
  "Not necessarily emails.",
  "CHUCK TODD: No worries.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Hi, Chuck.",
  "How did this all start?",
  "How their voters think.",
  "Thank you for watching.",
  "51 percent disapprove.",
  "They were meaningless.",
  "And if so, what is it?",
  "Can you clear this up?",
  "We get the background.",
  "DANIELLE PLETKA: Yeah.",
  "There is no collusion.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Thank you.",
  "Is that what happens?",
  "CHUCK TODD: I get it.",
  "SEN. MARK WARNER: No.",
  "So that’s number one.",
  "It’s not covering up.",
  "And it's health care.",
  "That's not happening.",
  "That I can tell you.",
  "Was it even illegal?",
  "Aiding and abetting?",
  "Republican Missouri.",
  "Good to be with you.",
  "There is no context.",
