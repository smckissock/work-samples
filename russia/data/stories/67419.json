  "\"Dozens of false criminal cases were initiated against innocent people just for their participation in the protest actions of May 6th,\" he said, mentioning by name anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny, who stands accused in four criminal cases (\"absolutely fabricated\") and is restricted in his movements to the Moscow Region; far-left protest organizer Sergei Udaltsov who is under house arrest; and his own father.",
  "In his actual speech -- the prewritten bits of which you can read here while observing from this video that he spoke mostly extemporaneously -- Gudkov pointed to widening gulf between state-concocted agitprop and the independent news and information accessible to more and more Russians through the Internet.",
  "Last week, sensing that its indulged status might soon come to an end, Just Russia expelled Gudkov from its ranks, making him the only independent to sit in Russian parliament -- until, that is, his friend and fellow lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev resigned from Just Russia in solidarity.",
  "Nikolai Levichev, the leader of Just Russia's group in the Duma, claimed that an American linguist analyzed Gudkov's speech and found that, owing to some outre choice of words, the entire thing had been pre-scripted as an exercise in anti-Motherland propaganda.",
  "The linguist who performed this sub-Chomskyan gloss went unnamed, but the conspiratorial lexicon included Gudkov's use of \"shelled\" for the more colloquial \"fired\"; \"donate\" when any non-native English speaker from Russia would clearly say \"give.\"",
  "On Wednesday, the Duma Ethics Commission, whose former head, Vladimir Pekhtin had to resign last month after bloggers uncovered his extensive and undeclared property holdings in Florida, then agreed to three things.",
  "On March 12, a pro-Putin think tank, which carries the marvelous name, Center for Problematic Analysis and Public Policy Development, leaked news of a mathematical study it conducted on the Duma poll.",
  "To make matters worse, or at least more interesting, the man in charge of this think tank is Vladimir Yakunin, the head of the state-owned Russian Railways and a staunch \"conservative\" Putinist.",
  "It was they, he said, who were fomenting real change inside his country as members of a creative middle-class that could organize, fundraise and strategize without a by-your-leave from the czar.",
  "It found that United Russia lost the election to the Communists; the former's tally had to be artificially inflated by around 12 percent to get the result that was officially announced.",
  "(Two days after the report was leaked, Yakunin disassociated himself and the Centre from Sulakshin's findings, which he claimed were baseless.)",
  "He drew a distinction between \"TV-citizens\" and \"net-citizens,\" which is as good a sociological assessment of post-Bolotnaya Russia as any.",
  "\"United Russia didn't come first [in the Duma polls],\" Stepan Sulakshin, the Center's director, told independent Russian outlet RBK Daily.",
  "And he pointed out the obvious fact that enemies of the Kremlin are suddenly finding themselves under arrest or indictment.",
  "This might be odd allegation hear from a beneficiary of that election but it is by no means a radical one to make.",
  "The second was that he must offer a public \"apology\" for traveling to the United States in the first place.",
  "So if anything, Gudkov was well ahead of his government's own interpretation of recent events.",
  "The first was that Gudkov would be stripped of his right to address parliament for one month.",
  "As for systemic politics, the last Duma election, Gudkov called \"totally forged.\"",
  "(In fact, the speech began with Gudkov apologizing for his poor English.)",
  "The regime and its handmaids then went into full Absurdistan mode.",
  "The third was that he should resign from the Duma.",
  "\"Its actual result was 20-25 percent.\""
