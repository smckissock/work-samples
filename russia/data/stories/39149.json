  "Easily hackable, subpoena-able email, during a campaign that centered on his father’s opponent’s poor email management skills.”\n\nKeeping notes on a criminal conspiracy is exactly the kind of mistake you would have expected from someone who had no experience with either election law or political strategy.",
  "British publicist Rob Goldstone offered to set up a meeting “as part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr.’s response was “if it’s what you say I love it” — an explicit, written record of the Trump campaign’s willingness to work directly with the Russian government.",
  "“If Trump Jr. had wanted to get the materials being offered but cover himself, he would’ve emailed back to say he was appalled at the suggestion, but then used a more secure means of communication to contact Rob Goldstone, who was offering the files, and set up a meeting,” Matthews writes.",
  "If Trump knew that his son and top advisers were trying to acquire information about Clinton from the Russians, and explicitly directed them to use that to help him win the White House, the political pressure to impeach him could become irresistible even for his fellow Republicans.",
  "This, according to legal experts, is also devastating for Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House aide, and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, both of whom were copied on the emails and may thus also face potential criminal prosecution.",
  "(Looking up the background of an obscure radio host is, in fairness, exactly the kind of campaign nicety the Trump campaign never bothered with; still, Edwards himself said that nearly all Republican candidates refused to appear on his show.)",
  "Trump Jr. was the campaign’s emissary to the alt-right\n\nThe meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer isn’t the first time Trump Jr. has told a changing story about a controversial meeting with a group offering support to his father’s campaign.",
  "On Tuesday, seemingly to preempt another Times story, he posted the full email exchange in which he arranged the meeting — and the actual emails themselves are the first concrete evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
  "While Ivanka Trump reached leftward, promising action on equal pay and child care, Donald Trump Jr. stoked the base — including the racists and anti-Semites that most candidates would scorn but that Trump Sr. was seemingly happy to court.",
  "The campaign claimed each of these was either an innocent mistake or misinterpreted by the media — they claimed Trump Jr. didn’t know who Pepe the Frog was and that the “gas chambers” comment was meant to refer to corporal punishment.",
  "The New York Times reported on Monday night that Donald Trump Jr. went to a meeting with a Russian attorney in June 2016 with the express purpose of getting information that the Russian government had acquired on Hillary Clinton.",
  "He retweeted a retired psychology professor whose hobbyhorse is the idea that Jews are destroying America, and made an odd reference to the media “warming up the gas chambers” if Trump matched Hillary Clinton’s alleged misdeeds.",
  "It now makes sense why Trump Jr. would have the influence to pull campaign heavyweights like campaign chair Manafort and Kushner (who, of course, also had no qualifications other than being Ivanka’s husband) into a meeting.",
  "Trump has spent his life running a family business; he inherited a real estate fortune from his father and went on to build a personal company, branded in his own name, that employed most of his adult children.",
  "And now, on Thursday, we’ve learned that Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassely is going to ask Donald Trump Jr. to testify before the committee — and may even force him to with a subpoena if he refuses.",
  "If his father hadn’t adopted slogans with an anti-Semitic history, like “America First,” or hadn’t proposed far-right policies, like the “Muslim ban,” Trump Jr.’s tweets wouldn’t have been such a problem.",
  "A series of social media posts and odd public statements were interpreted as nods to the meme-slinging anti-Semites and white supremacists who wanted to help Donald Trump troll his way to the White House.",
  "Trump Jr. embodies his dad’s conflict of interest problems\n\nA prime fear about the Trump presidency has long been that Trump would use the presidency to enrich himself by favoring his business interests.",
  "That’s what happens in corrupt dictatorships where family members loot government coffers for profit, not advanced democracies — which are at least in theory supposed to be staffed by qualified people.",
  "Trump Jr. tweeted a meme featuring Pepe the Frog among a collection of Trump-supporting “deplorables” and a Breitbart article about a European “rape epidemic.” He compared Syrian refugees to Skittles.",
  "But to accidentally tweet one racist meme might be regarded as misfortune; three or more, and it starts to seem like a strategy — one with a veneer of plausible deniability for the Trump campaign.",
  "From his speech, Politico gushed that “a political star may have been born.”\n\nBut it soon became clear that Trump Jr. was also a sort of emissary to less politically acceptable supporters.",
  "Trump Jr.’s Russian follies came directly from his father’s\n\nDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?",
  "Trump agreed to this deal despite, or perhaps because of, Agalarov’s ties to the Kremlin: Agalarov had once received the Order of Honor, a pretty high-level award, from Putin’s government.",
  "Trump Jr. himself said, in a statement on Tuesday, that he saw the email to be “relating a request from Emin.”\n\nTrump Jr. wouldn’t have had this opportunity if he hadn’t met Emin in 2013.",
  "His strategy for defusing the obvious conflicts of interest was to put Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump in charge of his business empire and to not give them official roles in government.",

  "Ivanka now has an office in the West Wing, and even sat in for her father during the G20 summit, a meeting of a number of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful countries.",

  "After his father’s victory, Trump Jr. was appointed to the presidential transition team despite not having any demonstrable knowledge of how the executive branch works.",
  "He was an avid hunter who spent a year in Colorado after college, followed gun rights groups on Twitter, and could speak on the right to bear arms with authenticity.",
  "Nor is it the only way in which his personal associations appeared to have revealed facets of his father that the Trump team would rather have kept less visible.",
  "And despite the promise that the Trump Organization would eschew foreign deals while Trump was in office, Trump Jr. flew to Dubai to meet with business partners.",

  "Our colleague Dylan Matthews described Trump Jr. as a “staggeringly incompetent” political operative and conspirator, and it’s hard to argue with his case.",

  "Trump Jr. was known to be a close adviser to his father during the campaign, even giving a high-profile speech at the Republican National Convention.",
  "When he was confronted about it, his defense sounded awfully familiar, given what he’s said in the past few days about his meeting with the Russians.",
  "He was a living, breathing instantiation of the president’s myriad conflicts of interest — ones that Trump Sr. has barely even attempted to address.",

  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013\n\nThe actual story of the June 2016 meeting begins three years earlier, in November 2013.",
  "Like other ethically conflicted situations where Trump Jr. got involved, it gave the president, at most, a veneer of plausible deniability.",
  "Back then, Trump Sr. was a merely a reality TV star and real estate magnate, one who happened to own the Miss Universe beauty pageant.",
  "This all raises the question that brought down President Nixon during Watergate: What did the president know, and when did he know it?",
  "Goldstone, the British publicist who arranged the event, worked for Emin and explicitly said the meeting was arranged on his behalf.",
  "Trump Sr.’s name remained on his businesses, and if he wanted to know how things were going, all he had to do was ask his children.",
