  "“Ultimately a lot of things would have had to fallen into place, in my opinion, the most being that nobody at the hotel, nobody at the pageant, there’s hundreds of people involved in that, nobody in Emin’s organization — they told me everything about everything — has mentioned it before, during or after the story broke, which is when everybody crawls out of the woodwork.”\n\nGoldstone, who says that he has not talked to Agalarov about the dossier’s allegations, also questioned the credibility of “Source D,” who has been identified in press reports as a Belarusian American businessman named Sergei Millian.",
  "In the dossier, which was funded by Democrats, author Christopher Steele cited a source — “Source D” — who claimed to be present when Trump engaged in “perverted” conduct that included “employing a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.”\n\nSteele claimed that Kremlin operatives had wired Trump’s room at the Ritz Carlton and used footage to blackmail the real estate tycoon.",
  "Goldstone said that he believes he would have known about Millian had he been with the Trump team in Moscow because Goldstone, Agalarov and Agalarov’s staff “interfaced with the Miss Universe organization on every detail.”\n\nGoldstone has been questioned by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller as well as a federal grand jury investigating Trump’s links to Russia.",

  "Goldstone was identified in press reports as the person who sent an email to Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016 stating that a “Russian government attorney” would provide “information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia.”\n\n“If it is what you say I love it,” Trump Jr. responded.",
  "But he now admits to using “puffed up” language in his email to Trump Jr.\n\nGoldstone also addressed a theory among some Trump critics that some members of the Russian delegation stayed behind the main meeting for a smaller gathering, possible to discuss the exchange of Clinton emails or other dirt.",
  "Goldstone attended with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, her interpreter, Anatoli Samochornov, a Russian-American lobbyist who worked with Veselnitskaya named Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, an employee of the Agalarovs who was also at the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.",
