  "RM: So the Alex Stamos memos interesting because it's dated from March, uh late March 2018, which is right after if you remember, uh, the Cambridge analytic stories broke in the New York Times And The Observer so to kind of rewind a little bit: Stamos was an executive at Facebook who reportedly had some disagreements over, uh, investigating Russia disinformation and Russian interference in the election that happened on Facebook and by March it was reported that he was going to leave the company by August of that year.",
  "And the way that they tested those ads for the Facebook platform was they took a method that was used in the Trump campaign called “Test, Learn, Adapt.” And what they did in that is they would test an ad, say they would run a red ad and a blue ad and they would test that against a small audience and if one had a better reaction, they would learn about that and then they would adapt the ad to then be broadcast across a larger audience on Facebook.",
  "DM: Well, this is a crazy story from our Pentagon correspondent Vera who has looked at, uh some emails that she got through FOIA and looking at how uh, the White House basically has been keeping the Pentagon out of the loop on the statements that they released to the press and basically looking behind the scenes when uh, the White House says something to reporters and the Pentagon officials are kind of like what the fuck was that?",
  "So Facebook's been trying to do a lot of these conference calls, a lot of these face-to-face meetings with reporters to show that they're being transparent and a lot of reporters: myself, the New York Times, the Post, everyone was on this call yesterday and someone asked the street pretty straightforward question: Have you seen interference in the run-up to the 2018 midterms and they kind of dodged the question.",
  "I mean Facebook's never been in a situation like this before it's kind of facing a crisis of confidence from the public and these are the kinds of people that you kind of want in your corner asking these difficult questions, challenging Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg on these issues... And yet he's leaving.",
  "There are law enforcement agencies around the country starting to use this but the ACLU has a few quibbles with this, uh, they say it screws up a lot, especially on minorities, especially on women, and to prove this to try to convince Congress that this wasn't perfect, they did something quite smart I think.",
  "SH: If we're looking at this from the perspective of the average Facebook user, who's getting targeted with all kinds of ads, political, apolitical, retail, whatever, what is this relationship that Facebook has with its advertisers and that Facebook has with speech, mean for the average Facebook user?",
  "She said, The bacteria are present at all times in all waters at sometimes in oysters grown or harvested in places like Alaska or northern Europe where you wouldn't expect them to be but if you really are a fan of raw oysters, I think you should just keep in mind you know what the risk factors are.",
  "I mean you don't really hear Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg going out and kind of being their chest about how they made a ton of money off political ads largely because I mean there would be like an extreme public backlash given the kind of discussion around the election.",
  "TT: I asked the CDC expert if um say getting uh oysters harvested from cold water was safer because many people postulate like hey, as long as you don't get them from the Gulf in summer, you should be fine because that's warmer water and it's more likely to grow Vibrio.",
  "And so the memo came out right after the Cambridge Analytica stories about a week after in the attempt to kind of explain why he was leaving the company and this is an internal memo hasn't been circulated outside of Facebook until we published it on Tuesday.",
  "It's really shocking right the basically the correspondence is sort of like, when somebody on the group text doesn't understand what the joke is or is like somehow like left off the chain and they're like, \"I'm sorry, what was that thing you said?\"",
  "And the president has previously said not only did he not have an affair with this woman, but he never knew of any uh payout to her and of course now, there's some sort of taped evidence indicating that, well on the latter at least, he was lying.",
  "New presidents get lots of phone calls from lots of important people, but it seemed like Zuckerberg was making this call after his advertising team had worked extremely closely with the Trump campaign over previous election period.",
  "Agerenesh Ashagre: I highly recommend The Bold Type season two—well season one also, but if you stopped watching for whatever reason you should definitely tune into season 2, which is currently on Freeform and available on Hulu.",
  "RM: Yeah SH: In a note that he wrote to employees that felt very like it was very high level as very principled and he felt like we have to you know, make better decisions about what voices we’re amplifying, that kind of thing.",
  "SH: Right and then Charlie Warzel who was your co-author on this piece said on Twitter I think that it’s interesting that he's saying all this so bluntly as he's leaving, instead of staying in trying to help make things better.",
  "I mean the reason why Charlie and I started looking at that actually was because we had obtained these documents that showed Facebook marketing team actually kind of speaking glowingly about their work with the Trump campaign.",
  "And so it just seems so weird to me that they wanted to host these conference calls, but they're unable to answer basic questions about what they're doing to prepare and what they're seeing heading into the 2018 election.",
  "And I think that in terms like I think that in 2018, if you're not thinking of a sort of stunty strategy to try and make your point against a very bizarre and wildly chaotic news cycle, you're not thinking hard enough.",
  "If you have an underlying health condition if you have an immune system weakness, if you've got liver or kidney disease or if you have type 2 diabetes, I I would say you should probably not eat any kind of raw seafood.",
  "That's not that dangerous that would most of the time it resolves on its own just like any kind of food poisoning you'll be fine, but it's not a bad idea to call your doctor right away and say hey I've eaten oysters.",
  "TAPE: Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out Of My Head DM: This is this great story from our tech reporter Daniela who has a piece on how Amazon's facial recognition, which is like we're living in the future now, right?",
  "They basically ran through all the photos of people in Congress and showed that 29 members of Congress were wrongly matched up with fugitives and wanted suspects of crimes and to show how much this is not reliable.",
  "JF: Yeah, let's just listen to a you know, a choice sampling of things that Michael Cohen recorded: TAPE: DM: But there's obviously... Was this story about uh, whether or not Trump, uh knew about this payment.",
  "So, you know, you just want to keep in mind that there's other more important things like eating undercooked hamburgers or undercooked food, getting a severe sunburn and also being aware of water safety.",
  "But when you do it can be very very serious and there have been a number of high-profile deaths—one in Texas and other one in Florida and another one in Virginia—related to infections with Vibrio.",
  "She calls it “So Many Thoughts” and it's incredible and I feel like I'm learning so much about fashion because I'll be like, oh she looks so cute and Royal and she'll be like, this is a bad look.",
  "It's almost like disgustingly real and I hate that I relate to it so much but the characters are great, the writing is amazing and funny, and it's incredibly diverse so you should check it out.",
  "I mean, this is a company that will control how information is disseminated into your newsfeed into your Instagram feed, into basically the main types of media that people are using these days.",
  "And if you look at what's been said about their work with the Trump campaign in financial companion disclosures, Trump spent a lot of money, tens of millions of dollars on Facebook Advertising.",
  "RM: It's bizarre because I mean they wanted they want to be transparent but they can't be so like why are you even hold these calls in the first place if they're not going to answer questions?",
  "It's called Vibrio vulnificus and you can get it from eating raw seafood, or you can also get it from swimming in the ocean if you have an open cut so it's very unusual to get this infection.",
  "So here's how it works: I'm gonna give you a news story from this week and you are going to come up with a snappy little subject line for it and tell us why we should give a shit about it.",
  "He's just the president's old, uh private attorney and now it emerged he's been secretly taping him over the years and of course, uh prosecutors have their hands on some of these tapes.",
  "And one of the hosts Rob Hayes is like the last remaining Kanye stan and just seeing the hoops that he jumps through to make Kanye West life, public life makes sense is truly amazing.",
  "Things like we should listen to people if people are telling us that we're doing creepy things or we should be willing to take sides and instances of of a kind of moral discussions.",
  "SH: We're at a point where people are really scrutinizing what's going on, especially considering, you know, Zuckerberg comments about Holocaust deniers from a couple of weeks ago.",
  "I think um, you're referring to there been a lot of headlines lately about what some people call a flesh-eating bacteria, so Vibrio, and there's 12 different kinds of Vibrio.",
  "So earlier this week you and Charlie again had a story about a previously unreported call that Zuckerberg made to the president post-election, which is not super unusual.",
  "And I think this what a genius uh Congressional move because now there are two congresspeople who have already written a letter saying we want some answers from this.",
  "SH: So Facebook is its own country and it's not surprising that there are a lot of different opinions within it about how— RM: Zuckerberg would dispute that.",
  "I mean that comes in direct conflict with what we're seeing in the Stamos memo that was sent out to employees in March this idea of like taking sides.",
  "They call it flesh-eating for a reason because can really infect her tissues and move very very rapidly and some people do unfortunately lose limbs.",
  "I mean, yes, they have like two billion users, but he says first and foremost that they're a company and he's tried to make that point very clear.",
  "You mentioned the Holocaust comments that Zuckerberg made with regards to allowing Holocaust deniers to post their opinions on the platform.",
  "You've had a busy couple of weeks here, uh with a couple of pretty big Facebook scoops from the head of security at Facebook who's outgoing.",
  "TT: Yeah, like I think in terms of the risk, things like flesh eating bacteria get a lot of headlines; they’re really grabby and very scary.",
  "Highly Recommended — 22:11 Dara Levy: I would recommend this great show I've been watching on freeform called Disney's Fairytale Weddings.",
  "A lot of people call it glorified A/B testing, but the Facebook platform allows you to do this rapidly like within seconds and at scale.",
  "And this is a common thing that you see with Vibrio is that he had um, you know type 2 diabetes, he was on dialysis for kidney disease.",
  "So I think a lot of people around the country I've seen these “fake news is not your friend” Facebook ads on bus stops and billboards.",
  "I mean the average users can be paying attention to what Facebook is allowing on its platform because it really matters what they see.",
  "Subject Line — 16:02 JF: And now it's time for subjects line with special guest breaking news editor David Mack, resident Australian.",
  "However, and um, I think it's just a cautionary tale that just important to be aware of it, but not too scared of it's still extreme.",
  "He also had underlying health conditions, you know, he ingested the bacteria and it manifested as these just terrible skin ulcers.",
  "That's why and we also see the White House trying to tell everyone later that \"no no, there's no chaos here, everything is great.\"",
  "I mean you have these executives that are saying a lot of different things and they just seem kind of confusing and conflicting.",
  "But for the most part there are a lot of things that can happen to you during the summer that are much more likely than Vibrio.",
  "Every week, every day, I wake up in the morning and I think what how can I make Kylie Minogue more a part of this news cycle?",
  "It was a 71 year old man in Sarasota Florida, I believe and he got it from eating raw seafood and he got sick very quickly.",
  "And so these documents were kind of what set us looking at this trying to understand how Facebook viewed Trump internally.",

  "RM: Yeah, and we talk to at least one kind of former senior executive at the company who said that.",

  "SH: They say they are and then they had this call on Tuesday with reporters.",
