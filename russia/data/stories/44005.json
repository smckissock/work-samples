  "\"It's similar to what's going on in reality right now, and I'm happy 'The Show' sparks the debate about the danger of big tech, especially among millennials,\" Syta told Business Insider.",

  "He told my colleague Jim Edwards in 2016 that 90% of the book was true or inspired by real events, mentioning a culture of narcotics and meaningless sex.",

  "All I can say is 64 million Americans went to church on Sunday — and that same day, every single American went to The Show twice.",
  "And it doesn't take a Google engineer to work out that it's something of an allegory of the omniscient power of Silicon Valley.",
