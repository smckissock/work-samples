  "From season two's Battle at the Blackwater, to season five's surprise Hardhome massacre and then season six's Battle of the Bastards, even people who don't watch the series have a hard time remaining ignorant of the massive productions featured each season.",
  "Put thousands of diehard \"Game of Thrones\" fans into a giant room, place Ramin Djawadi onstage with a live orchestra, and add huge screens playing the best scenes from every season, and you have a recipe for a bangin' good time.",
  "Instead of just watching Daenerys' dragons take flight over her new army of Unsullied in your living room, it's playing on a giant screen in front of you and you're seeing the TV magic unfold with thousands of fellow superfans.",
  "Djawadi's haunting piano track \"Light of the Seven\" was the star of the second act, with nearly six minutes of build up while Djawadi himself played the giant organ (or what was more likely a keyboard disguised as an organ).",
  "There were even real fire bursts synced up to the on-screen dragons:\n\nKim Renfro/INSIDER\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" often raises the bar when it comes to producing television on an epic scale often equated to big-budget movies.",
  "The swell of emotion you felt when Jon Snow died wasn't due solely to seeing a hero bleeding on the ground, it was partially because Djawadi selected the melancholy Stark theme music to play over Jon's final moments.",
  "If you are a \"Game of Thrones\" fan, listening to live renditions of the series' most epic soundtrack moments while watching each of your favorite characters get their own tribute montage is about as good as it gets.",
  "The sequence of music chosen by Djawadi is not only chronologically matched with the show's seasons, but it was meant to force fans to relive both the best and worst moments of their favorite characters' stories.",
  "And Daenerys setting sail for Westeros wouldn't have been nearly as monumental without hearing the Targaryen and Greyjoy themes blended together for a new song, striking an inspiring note while signaling change.",
  "But if you are a hardcore rewatcher, then the event becomes participatory — you're able to guess what's coming next based on small musical cues, and you can sit back and bask in your favorite soundtrack moments.",
  "Kim Renfro/INSIDER\n\nAs the song built up to its heartbreaking end, Ned's execution scene played out on the huge screens while a weirwood tree rose from the stage around the violinist.",
  "Then, from start to finish, Djawadi combines stage effects with his live orchestra, playing various scenes from the show as they sync up with his chosen selection of soundtrack songs.",
  "That platform is rigged with a rising center and interactive walls with a screen above, so a violin soloist or singer can have their time to shine away from the rest of the bustle.",
  "Composer Ramin Djawadi leads an orchestra and group of singers as they go from the iconic main title song all the way to the final music played in the season six finale.",
  "If you're not a fan who rewatches every episode and can recognize every soundtrack listing, Djawadi's concert acts as a part-educational, part-nostalgic spectacle.",
  "The green flames of wildfire licked up the stage's screen, until finally the platform erupted with pyrotechnics and smoke as the Sept of Baelor exploded on-screen.",
  "Djawadi purposefully placed the Lannisters' tribute and a chilling cover of \"Rains of Castamere\" right before the tragic Red Wedding scene played out on screen.",
  "Tickets for the show range from $20 - $200, depending on the arena and seating, and we think the price of entry is worth it for any and all fans of the show.",
  "As Ned's death came closer, the tree bloomed with red petals — petals that eventually came showering down on fans standing near that section of the stage.",
  "Try watching a compilation of his and Bran's journey north before seeing his sacrifice while listening to the terrifying White Walkers' theme music.",
  "The show was split into two acts, just like a play or an all-star sports game, with a fifteen minute intermission between each hour or so of music.",
  "The sweeping musical score makes a huge contribution to these moments of epicness, and so hearing each song performed live has an inherent magic.",
  "Kim Renfro/INSIDER\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" concert experience is effectively like watching a compilation of the \"greatest hits\" in the series.",
  "People booed loudly whenever Cersei Lannister, Walder Frey, or Ramsay Bolton appeared on screen, and cheered \"King in the North!\"",
  "A soloist stood on one end of the 360° stage, playing the mournful Stark theme while Ned, Catelyn, and their children were shown.",
  "Which is why HBO and \"Game of Thrones\" composer Ramin Djawadi's idea for a \"live concert experience\" is genius at its core.",
  "Her voice booms over the dark concert hall, requesting that everyone silence their cell phones.",
  "\"Those who violate these rules will be boiled alive in the blood of their children,\" she says.",
  "Djawadi and his orchestra are on one side, with a symmetrical platform on the opposite side.",
  "Barry Brecheisen/HBO\n\nThe set up, no matter what city you see the show in, is a 360° stage.",
  "As our resident \"Game of Thrones\" nerd, I went to one to see for myself and report back.",
  "Kim Renfro/INSIDER\n\nDjawadi was tiny compared to the epic set surrounding him on stage.",
  "Kim Renfro/INSIDER\n\nThis is why the concert works, and is worth the price of entry.",
  "Barry Brecheisen/HBO\n\nYou thought Hodor's death on the HBO show was heartbreaking?",
  "For example, one of the first parts is a family montage dedicated to the Starks.",
  "The show opens with a pre-recorded warning from Lena Heady (Cersei Lannister).",
  "Barry Brecheisen/HBO\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Game of Thrones.\"",

  "And the crowd was more than happy to engage with the scenes shown.",
  "Then, he disappearing in a blaze of wildfire and smoke.",
  "Understandably, you might be confused by the concept.",
  "What exactly does a \"Game of Thrones\" concert entail?",
  "when they saw Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen.",
