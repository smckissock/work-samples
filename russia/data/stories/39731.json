  "You have the entire city, but you don’t feel like you’re in the city.”\n\nYou can see the city from the water yourself — for free — through the Downtown Boathouse, Village Community Boathouse or Manhattan Community Boathouse in Manhattan; the Northern Brooklyn Boat Club, Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse or Red Hook Boaters in Brooklyn; and Kayak Staten Island on Staten Island.",
  "No one thinks of going out on a boat.”\n\nOnce in the kayak, we paddled away from happy hour patrons at City Vineyard and toward New Jersey, periodically stopping to coast on the gentle waves rippling from the commuter ferries.",
  "We tried it for ourselves at Pier 26 along the West Side Highway, where the Downtown Boathouse hosts free kayaking several nights a week, holidays and weekends.",
  "“You think, ‘Let’s go to a coffee shop, let’s go check out the Met, let’s go to SoHo.’ You’re in the city, so you want to do city-type things.",
  "We arrived to a queue of kayakers clad in bikinis and swim trunks — a sight you don’t usually see next to a busy highway.",
  "“When you come to New York, you don’t think, ‘Let’s go kayaking,’” said Nida Masood, 23, a third-time kayaker in line.",
  "When we reached the buoy boundaries, we turned around and marveled at our surroundings.",
  "“But then you turn around and you’ve got Jersey and the Freedom Tower staring at you.",
  "“You go out there and don’t notice it,” Ms. Masood said of the view.",
  "And not a bad way to cool off after a week of unbearable heat.",
  "Kayaking is not a bad transit alternative."
