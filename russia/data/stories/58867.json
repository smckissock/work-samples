  "Now, if things weren't bad enough that Hillary is paying for Russian read from the Grassley-Graham memo, Russian government information to be used in an election to lie to the American people, then used as the bulk of information for a FISA warrant, none of it verified, if that's not bad enough, now we have the information that looks like Sid \"Vicious\" Blumenthal and people at the Department of State are complicit in providing Steele some of this phony information that he then coordinates with the Clinton campaign to disseminate to the lazy overpaid so-called journalists and media in this country.",
  "As it relates to the intel, I would think that we, if we ever got ahold of the FISA court, considering they are saying the bulk of information to allow this to go forward was based on this phony Hillary Clinton paid for Russian government dossier, I can only -- and they withheld all this information from the court, can I got to believe that court judge has got to be livid and furious tonight.",
  "It is clear though that at the time prior to the election and subsequent to the election, there were a group of people inside the FBI at the senior levels on the seventh floor who decided that they were going to protect Hillary Clinton, they were going to change 302s and they were going to make --\n\nHANNITY: 302s are witness testimonies.",
  "Tom, in this whole issue of Barack Obama wants to be kept abreast of all of this or Strzok and Page are preparing what appears to be talking points for President Obama, \"Wall Street Journal\" says it was not about the email investigation but from earlier comments that I saw that you made, you have your doubts about that?",
  "ATTKISSON: I think from what we know from news reporting and what we had learned since then under the (inaudible) of listening to a Russian official from ambassador from Russia to the United States they accidently captured somebody who may have been allegedly their true target hopefully lead them to mischief.",
  "I think part of the reason for that is there is a much bigger scandal under the surface and some people know this which is in my view not that they were going after President Trump, perhaps, during the campaign but why because unlike what they thought would happen if Jeb Bush were elected or Hillary Clinton.",
  "And he is telling them about this strategic plan of Putin to take over the uranium industry and he is writing up these reports and telling them about it is he also telling them about the corruption in these companies, all of them -- you know, they are all one company even though they were different names.",
  "And a new text message proves that on September 28, 2016, Strzok say: \"Got called up to Andy's earlier\" -- who we think is Andrew McCabe -- \"hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner's attorney to the SDNY\" -- the southern district of New York -- \"includes a ton of material from spouse. \"",
  "This is the letter that Devin Nunes has sent today to the presiding judge of the FISA court, requesting not one but four different hearings and any transcripts to determine the false misrepresentations of fact that were made allegedly by the Department of Justice and the FBI during those hearings.",
  "There is all kinds of ways I was told even before Donald Trump announced for office that intel officials and I was told this by insiders have sometimes been using bad information to bring to the FISA court to wrap up other people that are the true targets that they can't get a warrant against.",
  "There are some inside the intelligence community who have been there for more than one administration who feared that Donald Trump could bring in people who could peel back the layers and see the allegedly improper and illegal surveillance techniques they have implemented for a long time.",
  "He also contends in his testimony and his written briefs that the FBI -- that Russia attempted to hide their ongoing aide to help sustain Iran's nuclear industry at the time the Obama administration, in fact, approved the sale of 20 percent of U.S. uranium mining rights to Russia.",
  "But then the more important thing is who knew how do they possibly take unverified information withhold from the FISA court Judge that it's Hillary Clinton bought and paid for, how do you withhold that kind of information when seeking something as sensitive as a FISA warrant?",
  "This shows that the FBI was boot strapping all of the information that it was getting and it was basically a circular firing squad so that all the information was based on the same information that therefore nothing being presented to the FISA court was actually verifiable.",
  "But this is what he was testifying to those committee staffers who were questioning him that the Russians were consistently bragging about their relationship with the Clintons and that they would be able to move this through the Obama administration without any trouble.",
  "And, of course, there's the Republican House Intelligence Committee memo, remember the highlights from that document, the former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe revealed to Congress without that dossier, the FISA warrant to surveil would never have been approved.",
  "My question is to every one of us out there who see this happening, how do we deal with these people, Sean, because Sheryl myself and you know how ruthless they are and how diabolical they are they will stop at anything to stop honest people from uncovering them.",
  "And the Wall Street Journal's reporting that the FBI officials, top officials, including McCabe, they knew about Huma Abedin's emails that were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop in September of 2016, but they waited for at least a month before alerting Congress.",
  "Turns out everything and much more we have been literally unpeeling layers of an onion here with real facts and information the media has gone with the story about Russia Trump collusion with zero evidence for a year and bio mission don't cover these stories.",
  "And according to British court records, Steele talked to reporters, let's see, from the New York Times, fake news, The Washington Post, Yahoo News, New Yorker and, of course, the shh- hole network, fake news CNN at the end of 2016 about the dossier.",
  "Sara's reporting, quote: the informant who spent years gathering information on the Russia energy and uranium market industry for the FBI met staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, House Oversight and the House Intelligence Committees.",
  "So, after Lynch's statement that she was taking a backseat, she would go along with the FBI and James Comey, the same guy that she said don't call it an investigation, call it a matter, Strzok then writes to Page, oh, \"Timing looks like hell.\"",
  "Now, sources close to Strzok and Page, they are telling the Wall Street Journal tonight that this message they sent doesn't have to do with the Clinton email probe and, instead, was talking about possible Russian interference in the election.",
  "In June 2016, Bill Clinton infamously, remember, meets with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac in Phoenix for 40 minutes which caused Lynch to say on July 1 she is stepping away from the investigation and she would just accept the FBI's conclusion.",
  "That was when, guess what, Bill Clinton, former President and his multi-gazillionaire friend (inaudible) traveled to Pakistan and bestowed all kinds of praises on the dictator there and ended up with my surprise, with uranium mining rights.",

  "What's more, he obviously has not read the April 26th, 2017 opinion of the FISA court in which they accuse the FBI of purposefully and illegally and unconstitutionally leaking FISA 702 information to private contractors, which is a felony.",
  "Now, we previously uncovered that Fusion GPS co-founder, remember Glenn Simpson, he actually testified to a congressional committee that the Clinton campaign and the DNC were very aware that his company was contacting media outlets.",
  "And so, despite all the information that he provided to the FBI and to their counterintelligence unit, the Obama administration chose to ignore that and move forward with the sale of Uranium One, which was a Canadian mining company.",
  "Now, the FISA judge was, in fact, in this particular case never notified that the dossier was bought and paid for, again, by the Hillary Clinton and the DNC funneled through the same law firm, which of course is, a huge problem.",
  "Well, that all happened earlier today where he gave explosive testimony on his years as an undercover informant providing information to the FBI on Russian criminal networks that are operating right inside the United States.",
  "One can bicker about the meaning of some of the vagueness in these text messages, but it's abundantly clear in today's messages just reinforced it that there was such extreme political bias on the part of Strzok and Page.",
  "That they were no longer dealing with Iran on the nuclear reactors but at that time, William Campbell, the informant, was actually providing information and this was months before that Russia was still dealing with Iran.",
  "But they rigged the system so she could stay as the candidate, because they thought she would win and become President and even Strzok and Page were afraid oh my gosh, if she wins, she might get mad at us at one point.",
  "In this they are saying this dossier is full of Russian government lies, they don't say lies, but Russian government sources, Russians, and then we learn that there are Clinton sycophants also feeding Michael Steele.",
  "McCabe was sent packing as a result of Christopher Wray being briefed by a number of people who have access to the investigation that's underway, which is going to lead to criminal charges against a number of people.",
  "On May 19, two days after Robert Mueller was named the special counsel, Strzok was talking about joining the investigation with Mueller and Strzok asked Page this question: \"An investigation leading to impeachment?\"",
  "Before the CFIUS signoff, the nine different agencies signing off on the Uranium One deal, they knew that Vladimir Putin had operatives in this country that wanted to get a foot hold in our uranium industry.",
  "Wow, so they're giving -- literally, Clinton's friends are giving Steele some of the information is he using in that phony dossier but the rest of the information came from the Russian government, remember?",
  "Also, Sara Carter tonight reporting that the uranium one informant met with congressional staffers and gave explosive testimony about a Russian criminal enterprise operating right inside the United States.",
  "Now, during a September 2nd, 2016 exchange about creating talking points for former FBI Director James Comey to give to President Barack Obama, Page writes: \"POTUS wants to know everything we're doing\".",
  "Now, that text message provides very key proof that show that Comey, McCabe and others, they literally sat at a crucial moment on Huma Abedin's emails that were discovered on Anthony Weiner's laptop.",
  "Here with reaction tonight we welcome back to the program, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.",
  "It never made sense to allow when we knew Vladimir Putin he had a band of supporters in the country that wanted to get our uranium and then they are still doing this with Iran as Sara is mentioning.",
  "What you are seeing coming out now in the text messages is just the minimum of what is available now to DOJ officials as they watch sadly --\n\nHANNITY: Who do you think is going to get charged, Joe?",
  "Liberal morning show host Joe Scarborough and Dr. Mika Brzezinski they recently paraded on \"Saturday Night Live\" while many thought was an all too realistic impersonation of this cringe worthy duo.",
  "I mean, if you just look at the Grassley-Graham letter, it lays out a meticulous case of how the court was mislead, deceived, evidence was concealed but it may be even worse in those transcripts.",
  "So, what they were doing was hiding the fact -- they didn't tell the FISA court judge in their application that that dossier, that they didn't verify, was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton.",
  "Now, I've always wondered why president Obama has skated really free from any serious inquiries about his involvement in the Russia investigation, his knowledge about the dossier its origins.",
  "They were so confident in that that they even had him open up a new office because they were planning on the kind of business that they are going to do as soon they get the CFIUS approves it.",
  "This was almost a year ago on this program we broke the story right here with Sara Carter and John Solomon who had done incredible work, yeah they got a FISA warrant against Donald Trump.",
  "And he was told and has proof and evidence that in fact the response was, well, it's not going to be a problem as long as Hillary is in the administration, then as secretary of state?",
  "Full of salacious lies to get a FISA warrant against an opposition Party candidate to prevent him from winning and then when he does win, to try and unseat a duly elected President.",
  "The activities of McCabe and others and Bruce Ohr and others were designed to subvert the Constitution and a national election, the most serious offense under our Constitution.",
  "A patriotic service and you are protecting the President who honestly won the election despite all of this nonsense that was happening in the politicization of these agencies.",
  "And Brennan's comments this weekend about all of the stuff that Nunes is doing rank among the most disgusting political comments by any CIA -- former CIA director in history.",
  "Mr. Campbell was told by the FBI that he was being told and they were taking it upstairs and he was also told that the President Obama had it in his daily briefing twice.",
  "According to reports, what is in the upcoming DOJ inspector general report we expect next month is what caused Andrew McCabe to abruptly resign at the end of last month.",
  "And Strzok also played a key role in the Clinton investigation, even interviewing Hillary and helping James Comey write that exoneration months before the investigation.",
  "I want to know what Brennan and Clapper, I want to know about the surveillance, unmasking, leaking intelligence and their potential understanding and knowledge of that.",
  "I want to talk about the legality of all of this, because, we do know that Lindsey Graham and Senator Grassley, they got a chance to look at all four FISA applications.",
  "They are missing one the great corruption stories of American law enforcement and sad to say it involves the senior levels of the FBI and it is a national disgrace.",
  "The memo shows Steele was suspended and terminated as an FBI source for leaking to the press, demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr had a close relationship with Steele.",
  "And in March of 2017, James Comey, he briefed Congress that the FBI used the dossier in a FISA application because they thought Christopher Steele was credible.",
  "So it's either about the set-up that they were doing to set up Donald Trump or someone was saying it is about a meeting with Putin, but here is the bottom-line.",
  "Now, the Senate report notes this is likely a reference to the New York Times election forecast which showed Trump gaining ground at that point in the election.",
  "Now, Senator Ron Johnson has put out a report that is raising questions about President Obama's potential involvement in Hillary Clinton's email investigation.",
  "Either way you see President Obama being intensely involved in wanting to know everything about either the Clinton email investigation or Russia investigation.",
  "But then it gets even deeper is that Comey and others use this as the bulk of information unverified, Hillary Clinton bought and paid for, Russian propaganda.",
  "JEANINE PIRRO, \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE\" SHOW HOST: If you were to write a script for Hollywood even they might think that this was a little over the top.",
  "VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me take balk to 2005, because that is when this really started the Russian plan to take over U.S.",
  "And four days later, Comey holds his press conference right after they interviewed Clinton and that was Strzok's interview and they let Clinton off the hook.",
  "And finally tonight, the memo finds during the first FISA application for that warrant, corroboration of the Steele dossier was, in quote, its infancy stage.",
  "Despite the bombshell revelations in the Grassley-Graham memo and some pretty damning text messages from FBI official's lovers, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.",
  "HANNITY: OK.\n\nTOENSING: And then when he got involved in the uranium and Russian places, the CIA turned him back over to FBI counterintelligence, correct.",
  "Remember, we told you last night and he in part -- this takes the cake -- was being fed information from the Obama State Department and Clinton cronies.",
  "Now, Steele was briefing several mainstream media outlets these lies and propaganda in the summer and fall of 2016 about his first fake news dossier.",
  "The American people have to understand that their government is there to serve them, we are not here to serve the people that work in the government.",
  "It was then that my client was told that the Russians began to plan strategically how they could take over uranium, particular in the United States.",
  "And he believed that he wasn't going to make it and he wanted to ensure that his information became public and this was the only way he could do it.",
  "And personal animus toward Donald Trump the candidate and then the president that these two people should have been nowhere near the investigation.",
  "Now, the unredacted Grassley-Graham document is now showing that the phony dossier made up the bulk of the application to obtain that FISA warrant.",
  "Remember, Ohr is the guy who had an office four doors down from the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who would later appoint Robert Mueller.",
  "So, Page, Strzok, Lynch, Comey all knew that Clinton wouldn't be charged and the Obama administration, in fact, was rigging it and the fix was in.",
  "And we also know that James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein, all approved surveilling in this particular case.",
  "Also tonight, even more evidence that the FBI lied to a FISA court using that Clinton bought and paid for dossier to spy on the Trump campaign.",
  "TOENSING: When Mr. Campbell was asked today so why can you do all of this for so long and you were losing money and as you were sick, you said.",
  "So, the FBI never actually corroborated the information because Steele was the source of the dossier and fake news sorry by Michael Isikoff.",
  "It is inescapable, no matter what all these people are saying at the \"New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" with their silly editorials.",
  "But they do have authority as witnessed by this letter today to get their hands on the transcripts of the hearings before those FISA judges.",
  "On November 3, 2016, only days before the election, Page wrote, well, \"The New York Times probability numbers are dropping every single day.",
  "Did he know about the payments of the DNC and Hillary Clinton and the dossier's use in the Russia investigations and the FISA application?",
  "They were so confident, Sean, the Russian that they told Mr. Campbell that with the Clinton's help it was a shoe-in to get CFIUS approval.",
  "HANNITY: And the more important point is that he tried to tell people and warn people, specifically, about everything that was going on.",
  "You've never heard Mr. Panetta say anything about any of the conduct of John Brennan, the single most political CIA director in history.",
  "That was during the Watergate investigation, asking very important questions that President Barack Obama and others now need answers to.",
  "And, you know, some people have said and I have watched them on other programs and said, well, when Mueller found out, he fired Strzok.",
  "Now it's bad enough that they are using the dossier to feed to a liberal media that doesn't do any work or fact checking on their own.",
  "HANNITY: Anthony, Chuck Schumer says they will get you six ways and Sunday and this guy on fake news CNN saying they are going to win.",
  "ATTKISSON: I think there has largely been a lack of curiosity and a lack of accurate and thorough reporting on one side of this issue.",
  "FITTON: This president is being criminally investigated about his communication with the FBI director about a criminal investigation.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: Investigative reporter Sara Carter out with a huge bombshell report on the Uranium One scandal tonight.",
  "Now, Strzok was a former top intelligence official at the FBI and signed the documents, remember, to start the Russia investigation.",
  "Peter Strzok and to an extent Lisa Page who was Andrew McCabe's legal counsel, they are at the center of everything in all of this.",
  "You see, Sean, the frustration that I have and so many Americans have is that as we keep hearing these pieces of evidence come out.",
  "And also remember, the Senate report says the dossier, as we told you last night, full of information from the Russian government.",
  "And the author of the smear, how shady political operatives and fake news controls what you see, what you think, and how you vote.",
  "And now we know that President Obama, shock, lied to us when he said I'm not involved in anything involving the FBI and the DOJ.",
  "And tonight's video of the day we compare the real life Joe and Mika and their \"Saturday Night Live\" counterparts, take a look.",
  "Now, Strzok and page also called Trump an idiot, loathsome human being and talked about their insurance policy in case he won.",
  "The author of the dossier, \"...desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\"",

  "Also tonight, there is a new batch of text messages just released from Trump-hating FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.",
  "That's why tonight we have two very simple questions for Barack Obama and frankly everyone else involved in this scandal.",
  "Of course you have got these two FBI love birds saying --\n\nHANNITY: Do we know what that text messages specifically said?",
  "He was introduced to the FBI and they immediately sent him over to work with the CIA which he did for about 15, 20 years.",
  "And then Page later adds, \"It's a real profile in courage since she,\" Loretta Lynch, \"knows no charges will be brought.\"",
  "DIGENOVA: I can't answer that question because too much of the information about Comey is filtered through other people.",
  "And two blockbusters memos are now proving the FBI, in fact, lied to a FISA court in order to spy on the Trump campaign.",
  "But everybody tried to assure everyone that Russia was no longer and the Russians themselves, they were lying about it.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nHANNITY: That is so creepy, anyway, it looks like sometimes a reality is really better than fiction.",
  "HANNITY: When we come back, The Mooch, Anthony Scaramucci is back and Sharyl Attkisson as we continue, straight ahead.",
  "Because as someone who has tried criminal cases for decades, what you do is you put together the pieces of the puzzle.",
  "And that they were involved in bribery and racketeering and kickbacks and money laundering and all sorts of behavior.",
  "What was the reaction if you can tell us of these committees number one and number two, if you could explain the why?",
  "Here with more, Fox News contributor broke this story, Sara Carter, lawyer for the FBI informant Victoria Toensing.",
  "They used the dossier full of Russian lies to spy on the Trump campaign just before an important American election.",
  "And America's powerful tools of intelligence were weaponized to spy on opposition campaign during an election year.",
  "They were coordinating, in other words, about the dossier, coordinating their efforts to leak these Russian lies.",
  "And breaking now, we have brand new just released messages from anti-Trump FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.",
  "Keep in mind, during that same text exchange on May 19, two days after Robert Mueller was named special counsel.",
  "SCARAMUCCI: Yes exactly, that monster saying we are around for 100 plus years and you are around for 13 months.",
  "HANNITY: Sharyl, the bottom line is you have one Presidential candidate that pays for a phony Russian dossier.",
  "But what's even more important, Sean, is that they knew that the Russians were still double dealing with Iran.",
  "Brand new tonight, we have even more text messages from Trump-hating FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.",
  "So, in light of the new Strzok texts, well, we need to know what investigation is Obama want to be briefed on?",
  "They were using it as separate and independent source to corroborate the phony dossier before the FISA judge.",
  "Then they don't tell a FISA Judge the facts of who bought and paid for this phony dossier that is unverified.",
  "A lot of these FISA Judges, people think FISA Judges are picked, that they're special for the secret court.",
  "Well, he was on the Hillary Clinton case, the leader investigator, then he jumped to the Trump-Russia case.",
  "If you look at our top stories tonight, there is a part of me that can't believe all of this is happening.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1973)\n\nSEN. HOWARD BAKER, R-TENN.: What did the president know and when did he know it?",

  "They are all servants and they need to be held accountable for the nonsense that is going on right now.",
  "He knows, I assume we don't have enough uranium resources on our own, why didn't anybody listen to him?",
  "Oh, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS, specifically working on the anti-Trump opposition research.",
  "It's one of the mainstream destroy Trump favorite tactics to prevent you from getting the whole story.",
  "There is something called forum shopping where someone decides I want to get this Judge or that Judge.",
  "Then, on Election Day, November 8, 2016, Strzok then says: \"Oh my god, this is (blanking) terrifying.\"",
  "None of it is verified and she is also, Christopher Steele is being fed from Clinton's own associate.",
  "Anyway if you have something to say, let not your heart be troubled, just right there, 877-225-8587.",
