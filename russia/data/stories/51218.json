  "Not just a waste of money, but I’m sure, intensify in this country the same kinds of pressures and phenomena that we’re now watching undo Europe.”\n\nBased on what he has seen of Barack Obama’s security policy so far, Gaffney judged the President is “truly blind to the nature of the enemy we’re facing.”\n\n“His periodic public manifestations of concern about the Islamic State – to give him some credit, he’s moved away from thinking it’s the ‘jayvee team,’ but that’s partly because that kind of policy approach has enabled this danger to metastasize,” Gaffney said.",
  "He said the new useful idiots were self-declared humanitarians “in the service, whether they know it or not, of Islamists, and frankly other enemies of freedom.”\n\n“Whether he has a grip on the service that he’s rendering with these kinds of comments, I have no idea, but my guess is that he’s so imbued himself with this idea of, ‘what’s the humanitarian, what’s the social justice driven agenda?’ that he doesn’t have to bother himself with the facts, or worse, with the implications of his recommendations,” Gaffney said.",
  "“Are we talking about essentially enabling Europe to be repopulated by non-Europeans, who will transform it from a part of the free world, Western civilization, into something that is almost certainly hostile to the free world?”\n\nGaffney doubted Bono, or most current Western leaders, understood the Islamist theory of “civilizational jihad,” which calls for the transformation of soft Western states into Islamic states through mass migration and the subversion of institutions such as the court system.",
  "“But I fear that’s the inevitable result of a policy that says, ‘this has nothing to do with Islam.’ It certainly doesn’t have to do with all Muslims, but it has to do with the sharia-adherent ones, who – whether they’re involved in violent jihad of the Islamic State stripe, or the al-Qaeda stripe, or the Boko Haram stripe, or al-Shabaab – or that civilization jihad of the Muslim Brotherhood mode.",
  "Frank Gaffney, founder of the Center for Security Policy and a senior policy adviser to presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon his view on rock singer Bono’s call for a new, America-funded “Marshall Plan” to prop up nations in the Middle East and Africa, along with bringing even more migrants into Europe.",
  "“But it’s still a symptom of a larger problem he refuses to address, let alone do anything about.”\n\nFor that reason, he thought Obama’s impending visit to CIA headquarters would be “at most, a photo opportunity; at worst, it will be doubling down on a failed policy that is going to get Americans killed.”\n\n“I hope I’m wrong.",
  "Those are the things I think we’ve got to attend to before we start throwing money at Europe.”\n\nGaffney compared Bono, a man of the Left, to the “useful idiots” of the Cold War – those whose ideology made them unwittingly useful to the cause of global totalitarian communism.",
  "“The network that these jihadis have been able to use – in Europe most especially, but also here – to wield their violent kind of jihad is one that’s been put into place by the Muslim Brotherhood,” Gaffney charged.",
  "They are our determined – absolutely, I’m afraid, lethal – enemies, and will remain so until, and unless, they’re defeated.”\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.",
  "He found it troubling that the U.S. Congress would give a platform to “someone who’s espousing – intentionally or otherwise – programs, and plans, and initiatives that will cause us grief.",
  "“He’s off to the CIA today, to talk about defeating ISIS, but it’s as though that’s happening in isolation from the global jihad movement,” Gaffney said of the rock star.",
  "One aspect of civilizational jihad involves using more respectable organizations to establish networks of support for violent extremists.",
  "“That’s in mosques, that’s in Islamic societies and cultural centers, front groups of various kinds, influence operations.",
  "You can listen to the full interview with Frank Gaffney below:",
  "“A Marshall Plan for what?” Gaffney asked.",
  "I pray I’m wrong,” Gaffney added."
