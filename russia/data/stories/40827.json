  "The document says that “possible Russian efforts to set up a ‘back channel’ with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign.” That finding contradicts what Kislyak told Moscow, which is that the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner proposed the back channel with Russia during a meeting in early December 2016.",

Bannon in contempt for not fully complying with the committee’s subpoena to answer its questions.",

  "Democrats, who opposed adoption of the report, have accused Republicans of prematurely shuttering the committee’s year-long Russia investigation — and willfully disregarding evidence, they argue, demonstrates there was collusion.",
  "But the findings put some blame on “the Republican national security establishment’s opposition to candidate Trump” for “creat[ing] opportunities for two less-experienced individuals with pro-Russia views” to join the campaign.",
