  "It is inconceivable that a thorough investigation of the possibility of Trump and his campaign colluding with Russia would not include an investigation of the very people who were building links between Trump and Russia, and who have been proved to be comfortable engaging in illegal activity to sway the election.",
  "In a column for CNN, Whitaker said that “investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else.",
  "On it, Cohen describes, right before the 2016 election, a scheme to create a secretive shell company in order to hide a hush payment about an affair with the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.",
  "It was Agalarov’s son, Emin, who called for the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and eight figures linked either to the Kremlin or to a variety of oligarchs from the former Soviet Union.",
  "The conversation is clear: Weisselberg, who has worked exclusively for the Trump family since graduating from college, in 1970, was seen as an in-house expert on creating secretive companies to hide the flow of money.",
  "In those days, Whitaker, Sekulow, and others argued that there were, essentially, two clearly delineated and entirely separate spheres: the campaign was one and Trump’s businesses were something else altogether.",
  "Matthew Whitaker, the newly named acting Attorney General and the man who now has authority over Robert Mueller and his investigation, wrote, last year, that he believed the special counsel was going too far.",

  "Weisselberg would have been central to a variety of proposed business deals between the Trump Organization and Aras Agalarov, the Moscow-based billionaire with ties to Putin.",
  "In previous years, Cohen and Weisselberg had also been central players in the Trump Organization’s efforts to make deals with a variety of figures with ties to the Kremlin.",
  "We know—from audio tape, documentary evidence, and the words of several insiders—that Trump’s business dealings and his campaign were not separable in any meaningful way.",

  "For them, it was all one thing: helping Trump do whatever it was he wanted to do.",
  "Weisselberg was granted immunity in Cohen’s case and testified against him.",
  "There is no evidence suggesting that they say their roles were bifurcated.",
  "(Cohen later pleaded guilty to the crime, and implicated Trump in it.)",
