  "On July 10, two days after a New York Times report first revealed the Trump Tower meeting in 2016, exhibits released by the committee show that Goldstone forwarded Agalarov and Kaveladze a proposed “statement drafted by Trump lawyers which they have asked me to release.”\n\nIn his email to Goldstone proposing the statement, Futerfas wrote that “if you feel comfortable with this statement and are comfortable saying nothing more, at least for the time being, that would be our preference.”\n\nFuterfas described his effort to interview the attendees as routine.",
  "“Their efforts to conceal the meeting and its true purpose are consistent with a larger pattern of false statements about the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) blasted Grassley’s investigative efforts: “To call the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Trump-Russia investigation halfhearted is too generous.”\n\nBut the Judiciary Committee is moving on: Despite Democrats’ urgings, Grassley suggested that he would move on to other investigative avenues unrelated to potential Russian collusion.",
  "Apparently, when Veselnitskaya made her appeal about the issue, Goldstone said Trump Jr. suggested she should address her “what seemed very valid concerns ... to the Obama administration because they are actually in power.”\n\nTrump almost met Putin in 2013: Other issues touched on in the transcripts include alleged efforts to set up an in-person meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.",
  "Sometime after the meeting, Goldstone was even more apoplectic, texting Emin Agalarov that he had “20 years of reputation basically destroyed by this dumb meeting.”\n\nNo mention of hacked emails: One other major outstanding question about the get-together has been whether the attendees discussed a trove of internal documents and emails that had been stolen earlier that year from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign.",
  "Goldstone described Kushner as “somewhat agitated” and “infuriate[d]” during the meeting, and he apparently asked the Kremlin-linked lawyer at one point to “focus a bit more and maybe just start again?”\n\nGoldstone also thought things weren’t going well during the meeting, telling congressional investigators that he sent Kaveladze a WhatsApp message saying, “this is embarrassing,” and that Kaveladze nodded at him.",
  "In fact, Samochornov said there was no discussion “of anything that might reasonably be considered collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.”\n\nTrump Jr. batted away Russian adoption talk: According to Goldstone, Trump Jr. was quick to steer Veselnitskaya away from any requests made regarding an American law, the Magnitsky Act, that sanctioned Russian officials.",
  "Eventually, a Putin spokesman relayed the message that “due to the tardiness of the King of Holland, he was unable to schedule a meeting for Mr. Trump.”\n\nThe Mooch is back: Buried deep in the exhibits is an email Anthony Scaramucci sent to Goldstone on July 23, 2017, days before he started his brief tenure as White House communications director.",
  "Here are the highlights from the massive document dump:\n\nTrump Jr. attorney Alan Futerfas tried to harmonize accounts of the meeting: According to the documents, Futerfas contacted three participants in the meeting — publicist Rob Goldstone, Russian singer Emin Agalarov and Russian executive Ike Kaveladze — to discuss their memories of the day.",
  "It’s unclear what the president’s role was: President Trump himself is reported to have helped craft a statement about the 2016 meeting that portrayed it as dealing largely with Russian adoption laws and not campaign matters, which obscured its initial portrayal to Trump Jr. as a chance to receive dirt on Clinton.",
