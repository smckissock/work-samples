  "Bias versus politics\n\nWhat might normally have been a routine oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee for Rosenstein is now taking on a new focus in light of a report late Tuesday evening of roughly 375 politically-charged text messages exchanged between two top FBI employees that were turned over to congressional investigators.",
  "Clinton email probe\n\nDuring his opening statement, Goodlatte also hinted he would press Rosenstein on appointing a second special counsel \"to investigate the improprieties\" related to the handling of the investigation into then-Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton's email probe under then-FBI Director James Comey.",
  "In his opening statement, Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte previewed he would be asking Rosenstein about about Peter Strzok, one of the FBI's top counterintelligence experts, and FBI lawyer Lisa Page exchanged a running commentary of criticism of then-presidential candidate Trump via text message for months.",
  "Washington (CNN) The second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department stepped back into the national spotlight Wednesday to say he believes there's no good cause for firing special prosecutor Robert Mueller and that to date no one has asked him to remove the special counsel.",
  "Rosenstein -- who retains oversight of Mueller's investigation since Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from all 2016 campaign-related probes -- has managed to keep a low profile since his front and center role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey back in May.",
  "\"Reports on the political predisposition, and potential bias, of certain career agents and department lawyers on Special Counsel Mueller's team are deeply troubling to all citizens who expect a system of blind and equal justice,\" Goodlatte said in his opening statement.",
  "He continued: \"And so I believe that Director Mueller understands that and he is running that office appropriately, recognizing that people have political views, but ensuring that those views are not in any way a factor in how they conduct themselves in office.\"",
  "Wednesday's hearing gave lawmakers the opportunity to grill Rosenstein publicly on his views of everything from Trump's cable news-fueled rages about the Justice Department's handling of various investigations to Mueller's investigation.",
  "\"It authorizes him to investigate anybody who there is predication to believe obstructed justice,\" he said, later adding when asked to clarify on the President, \"It would include anybody who was suspected of obstructing justice.\"",
  "\"If the inspector general discovers that normal protocol was not followed or that the investigation was closed or otherwise tainted for political purposes, would that be a justification in your mind to reopen the investigation?\"",
  "\"Last week, (FBI) Director (Christopher) Wray acknowledged that the normal procedures were not followed with respect to Secretary Clinton's email server,\" Goodlatte told Rosenstein after his opening statement.",
  "\"I think it's important to recognize that when we talk about political affiliation -- that all demonstrates political affiliation -- the issue of bias is something different,\" Rosenstein responded.",
  "\"I believe based on his reputation, his service, his patriotism, and his experience with the department and with the FBI, I believe he was an ideal choice for this task,\" he told the committee.",
  "GOP Rep. Lamar Smith asked Rosenstein about Mueller asking for clarification about the scope of his investigation, whether Mueller may be \"casing too wide of a net\" in what he's looking into.",
  "Stzrok was immediately removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's team this past summer after the text messages were uncovered through an internal investigation at the Justice Department.",
  "Rosenstein responded: \"I think it's important to understand, congressman, that we have an inspector general who has 500 employees and a $100 million budget, and this is what he does.\"",
  "And on whether the committee could investigate Trump for obstruction of justice with regards to the Russia investigation, Rosenstein said Mueller's team can investigate \"anybody.\"",
  "And later when asked by another member of the committee if President Donald Trump has asked him to remove Mueller from the investigation, he said no one has asked him to do that.",
  "\"I am not going to be discussing my communications with the President but I can tell you that nobody has communicated to me the desire to remove Robert Mueller,\" he said.",
  "Later in the hearing, GOP Rep. Steve Chabot asked Rosenstein whether the political opinions of the members of the FBI investigation would influence the outcome.",
  "So I can assure you that the special counsel is conducting himself consistently with our understanding about the scope of his investigation.\"",
  "Rosenstein responded he wanted to wait until results from the inspector general's investigation before making a decision on Clinton's emails.",
  "During the hearing, Rosensetin praised Mueller for his work in the special counsel, saying there was no one better qualified for the job.",
  "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday he has seen no reason to fire Mueller thus far.",
  "When asked by the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jerry Nadler, if he's seen a cause to fire Mueller, Rosenstein responded: \"No.\"",
  "\"There are a lot of media stories speculating about what the special counsel may or may not be doing,\" Rosenstein responded.",
  "He later asked Rosenstein about the inspector general's investigation into the handling of the email probe.",
  "\"I have discussed this with Director Mueller ... We recognize we have employees with political opinions.",
  "\"We are now beginning to better understand the magnitude of this insider bias on Mr. Mueller's team.\"",
  "Later in the hearing, GOP Rep. Jim Jordan pressed Rosenstein to set up a second special counsel.",
  "\"And I'm here to tell you Mr. Rosenstein I think the pubic trust in this whole thing is gone.",
  "And it's our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions.",
  "You can disband the Mueller prosecutor and you can do what we've all called for.",
  "If there were no good cause, I would not,\" Rosenstein told the committee.",
  "But as you pointed out, my views about it are already known.\"",
  "He also said he's not afraid of Trump firing him when asked.",
  "\"That's the inspector general's job,\" Rosenstein responded.",
  "I'm appropriately exercising my oversight responsibilities.",
  "\"He'll reach his own independent determination.",
  "Appoint a special counsel to look into this.\"",
  "\"If there were good cause, I would act.",
  "\"This is unbelievable,\" he said.",
  "\"I know what (Mueller is) doing.",
  "... You're the guy in charge.",
  "This story has been updated.",
  "\"No I'm not,\" he said."
