  "Over the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies ‘target,’ or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories.”\n\nWeinstein “monitored the progress of the investigations personally.”\n\nIn a statement, Weinstein’s spokesperson, Sallie Hofmeister, said, “It is a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed at any time.”\n\nThe full story (which is truly a must-read) details a number of instances in which intelligence officers impersonated journalists or women’s rights activists with the intention of extracting information from alleged victims and reporters pursuing the Weinstein story.",
  "In another incredible piece of investigative reporting, The New Yorker‘s Ronan Farrow—the same journalist who broke the news of the rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein—details the lengths the movie producer went to suppress the mountain of harassment and rape accusations against him (57 women have come forward so far).",
  "Aside from being as thrilling as any crime novel, it goes far in helping to answer the question, “How did this stay quiet for so long?”\n\nIt’s also an excellent reminder to all of us that those in power have plenty of resources—and motive—to silence their victims.",
  "“The explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with [intelligence agency] Black Cube, signed in July, was to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against Weinstein that eventually emerged in the New York Times and The New Yorker.",
  "And for those who might think Weinstein is simply an extreme case, recall that now-deceased former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes used similar tactics (private investigators, intimidation) to keep a lid on the allegations against him.",
  "Farrow reports that Weinstein hired a number of intelligence agencies to investigate both his alleged victims and the journalists who sought to bring the story to light.",
  "• Harvey’s army of spies."
