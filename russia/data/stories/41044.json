  "Explains Grant: “Ultimately data science becomes the glue, the catalyst, that holds the chemistry and biology together.” Erik Andrejko, who runs Monsanto’s data science center, frames the company’s new mission more succinctly: “Feeding the world through math.”\n\nThis past December David Hula of Charles City, Va., won the National Corn Growers Association’s annual yield contest by squeezing 532 bushels of corn out of a single acre—a world record that trounced the 2015 U.S. national average by a factor of more than three.",
  "It’s at the center of several bizarre conspiracy theories: that it bought private military company Blackwater; that, as it plies the rest of the world with GMOs, it serves only organic food in its headquarters’ cafeteria; that the company and its “biotech mafia” henchmen caused Chipotle’s cmg food-safety crisis through sabotage; and that Monsanto, rather than the Zika virus, is responsible for microcephaly.",
  "“Confidence that they’re doing the right thing has blinded them to the fact that they need to be out there defending it.” The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that we must double the current level of food production to adequately feed a population predicted to hit 9.7 billion by 2050—and we’ll have to do it on less land (much of it scarce of water), using fewer resources.",
  "Climate Corp.’s chief technology officer Mark Young doubts that that Monsanto could ever get to a billion-acre footprint just by being a seed company, “but as a decision-based company, it seems to have a really good shot.” Monsanto, for example, doesn’t sell grape seeds, but it could some day advise grape growers on how to increase their yields.",
  "“I’ve never yet heard anybody go into a doctor’s office and say they want the same 1950s medicine as Grandma and Grandpa,” says Monsanto chief technology officer Robb Fraley, “but yet for some reason there’s a precondition to believe that was a better way to farm.” For the deepest skeptics of GMOs, it seems that the science is beside the point.",
  "“They will use a lot of that information to develop more efficient technologies,” says Paul Thompson, a professor of philosophy, specializing in food, at Michigan State University, “but I do think it’s something of a worry to see all of that information in the hands of a single actor.”\n\nConsider the tale of the honeybees.",
  "Environmentalists, masses of whom rail against Monsanto’s production of genetically modified seed (it is the world’s largest seller), called the company’s pledge to become carbon neutral “greenwashing”—an attempt to distract consumers from what they viewed as Monsanto’s ongoing poisoning of the planet.",
  "To its diehard critics it embodies all that is wrong with big, industrial agriculture—the corporatization of farming, the decline of smallholders, the excessive use of chemicals, a lack of transparency, and, of course, the big one: the entry of genetically modified organisms into our food supply.",
  "Hula had to get everything smack-dab perfect to reach that prize-winning yield: planting his rows the right distance apart, treating the soil with the precise microbes needed to keep it healthy, applying the ideal amount of nitrogen fertilizer at the ideal moment.",
  "Shortly after that excursion, the company Grant leads joined the chorus of other Fortune 500 companies robustly warning about the dangers of climate change—rhetoric that ultimately resulted in a pledge by Monsanto mon last year to become carbon neutral by 2021.",
  "Despite its name, the San Francisco startup is not just a weather-data company but also an algorithm builder, working to figure out how genetics, farmer practices, and the environment—what Grant calls “that ghastly, uncontrollable variable”—fit together.",

  "In previous decades and in previous corporate iterations, Monsanto (then a mere chemical company) produced Agent Orange, the powerful defoliant used during the Vietnam War, which was later blamed for causing cancer and other diseases to those exposed.",
  "With Climate Corp.’s algorithms—which are based on the analysis of satellite data, weather, field trials, farmer inputs, soil maps, and yield data from millions of acres of U.S. farmland—Monsanto suddenly had a new set of problem-solving tools.",
  "The goal of Climate Corp. was not to tell farmers they should expect a wet spring, but rather to advise them on how much nitrogen fertilizer to apply in a wet spring on a particular square meter of land, based on how they tilled their soil.",
  "After the acquisition was announced, he wrote a letter to employees acknowledging that many could expect to get emails from family and recruiters with the subject line: “Do you REALLY want to work at the MOST EVIL COMPANY IN THE WORLD ??!",
  "Photograph by Ryan Donnell for Fortune Magazine That kind of response gave pause to Jerry Hayes, then the chief apiary inspector with Florida’s Department of Agriculture, when Monsanto asked him to run its honeybee health efforts in 2012.",
  "“I don’t think it’s possible for people to feel antagonized by Monsanto more than they already do,” says CLSA Americas analyst Mark Connelly, who has covered the company—and the craziness surrounding it—for the past 15 years.",
  "But Friedberg—who stepped aside as CEO in January and remains a senior adviser—believed that combining Monsanto’s expertise in plant biology with Climate Corp.’s broader data analysis would actually do good in the world.",
  "The 35-year veteran of the company (Grant became CEO in 2003) has a passion for orchids—a love he acquired during a four-year stint in Singapore—and spends most spring weekends at home tending to his vegetable garden.",
  "Even many Cornbelt farmers—some of the seedmaker’s oldest customers—lashed out, accusing it of giving in to government and activist pressures by embracing the notion that climate change was even partly man-made.",
  "Monsanto sells not only its own seeds, genetically modified and otherwise, but also licenses its genetic technology (such as traits that, say, give cotton plants resistance to weed killers) to rival seedmakers.",
  "When Monsanto approached Climate Corp.’s founder David Friedberg with an offer to buy his then-seven-year-old company, Friedberg, a former Google googl employee and lifelong vegetarian, was at first a bit wary.",
  "It should not have been all that surprising that a company whose $15 billion in annual revenues come from getting the earth to grow stuff would be concerned about the changing climate of said earth.",
  "Promising to do something as seemingly benevolent as reduce its greenhouse gas emissions had somehow managed to piss everybody off—which, for the Creve Coeur, Mo., company, was business as usual.",
  "Many scientists and plant biologists express a sense of frustration that consumers have embraced technology in so many parts of their lives but have rejected it out of hand when it comes to food.",
  "Grant, now 58, is a man who favors hard data and statistical rigor, and who studied entomology and molecular biology as an undergraduate before getting a master’s degree in agricultural science.",
  "Record harvests have led to low commodity prices, eating into farmers’ incomes and their willingness to open their wallets—a factor that has forced Monsanto to cut its guidance for fiscal 2016.",
  "He is 6 feet tall and bearlike in stature, a physique he is quick to quip about: “You don’t get to look like this if you’re not very careful.” In April, Grant and I are at the company’s hive.",
  "The company that was founded in 1901 as a chemical maker, then turned itself into a biotech company, and finally became a seed company is metamorphosing anew: this time, into a data company.",
  "Nor do they take at face value Monsanto’s “feed-the-world” argument, contending that it’s merely a strategy for creating a sense of crisis that will let them push through a pro-GMO agenda.",
  "Depending on where they are in the world, farmers will increasingly wrestle with either intense rainfall or ongoing drought, and the respective pests and pathogens that come with them.",
  "Grant calls this “hubris”: “Twenty years ago,” he says, “we thought biotech was going to be the panacea.” In the past half-decade the company has begun to look beyond seed for answers.",
  "That same year it partnered with Danish company Novozymes, hoping to find ways to boost crop yields by harnessing plant microbiomes—the microorganisms that live within and on them.",
  "And we’ll have to do it as climate change rewrites the weather rules around the globe—and as ever more of that population achieves middle-class status and wants to eat accordingly.",
  "Farmers make some 40 decisions like these each season—decisions that were once made largely by tradition and training, but which are now reached increasingly with the help of data.",
  "The NAS found no evidence that there would be a higher risk to human health from eating genetically engineered foods than from eating their non-genetically-engineered equivalents.",
  "There, between Norway and the North Pole, Grant saw legions of black-and-white barnacle geese, which arrive like clockwork in May after wintering in Scotland, Grant’s native land.",
  "Still, that yearly growth rate would leave the U.S. average below 200 bushels by the end of the decade—far from Hula’s corn bonanza and nowhere near enough to feed the planet.",
  "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that changes in climate are already slowing the average growth rate for crop yields by up to 2.5% per decade globally.",
  "In July 2008 the National ­Geographic Society and other groups invited a few dozen corporate chieftains, world leaders, and scientists on a private boat trip to the Arctic.",
  "Monsanto wasn’t so much interested in the bees as it was in the RNAi technology, a tool it hoped to harness in creating corn that was resistant to rootworm and other pests.",
  "Among the passengers were Google googl co-founder Larry Page, former eBay (and now HP Enterprise) CEO Meg Whitman, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.",
  "In terms of revenue, Monsanto’s big-data forays have been insignificant so far, yet they offer the best opportunity for planet-feeding growth, many believe.",
  "The agricultural industry, as a whole, is ­lagging—which has led to reshuffling and consolidation, including the pending merger of Dow dow and DuPont dd .",
  "“They are based on very highly aggregated figures that don’t take into consideration the fact that a lot of production is going for fuel or animal feed.”",
  "At the time of publication, Monsanto had rejected the bid as “incomplete and financially inadequate,” though indicated it was open to further discussion.",
  "The geese normally synchronize their appearance in Svalbard with the melting snow and the blooming of grass, which they feast on after the long journey.",
  "That made my day.” In theory RNAi might help save the honeybees, just as other technology will almost certainly increase food yields around the planet.",
  "But in recent years, as the Arctic temperature has warmed, the timing of the first bloom of grass has become erratic, limiting the birds’ food supply.",
  "Photograph by Ryan Donnell for Fortune Magazine Breeding better seed has contributed to a more than 1% annual increase in corn yields, experts say.",

  "That company was trying to protect bees against Israeli acute paralysis virus, which is associated with the collapse of bee colonies.",
  "Biologists, for instance, have created corn plants that can be clustered closer together, meaning there can be more stalks per acre.",

  "Photograph by Ryan Donnell for Fortune Magazine\n\nThe world’s most vilified company—now a takeover target—has a plan to feed us all.",
  "The hope is that all of these shards of information can produce what most “big data” efforts rarely do: knowledge one can act on.",
  "But then, there’s that familiar problem for the company: suspicion of its motives, a reputational blight it can’t seem to shake.",
  "Photograph by Ryan Donnell for Fortune Magazine The demonizing of the company has played out in dark and sometimes comedic ways.",
  "It was a testament to the changing hegemony in agricultural science: Even for Monsanto, it wasn’t just about the seed anymore.",
  "And last year, to shore up its own agrichemical business, it attempted to buy competitor Syngenta—but that deal was rebuffed.",
  "Grant— a jovial fellow who describes himself as a “Scottish optimist, which is a really rare condition”—is altogether mild.",
