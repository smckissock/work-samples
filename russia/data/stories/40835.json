  "Mueller's investigators continue to ask witnesses — including former national security adviser Mike Flynn — about how administration officials connected with foreign officials during the campaign, transition and the administration.",
  "The Washington Post first reported that Mueller has gathered evidence that the secret meeting in Seychelles was an attempt to establish a back channel between Russia and the incoming Trump administration.",
