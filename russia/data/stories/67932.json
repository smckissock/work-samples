  "BROWN: I think this is a significant part of the story and committees on the hill will have a lot to look at, including this one and from our understanding the only reason it came to the attention of FBI investigators is because Jared Kushner six months after he filed his initial security clearance form, updated it, amended it with this meeting at Trump Tower with Don Jr. and Paul Manafort because he is going to be testifying on Capitol Hill.",
  "The only possible crime I see coming out of this particular event involving Donald Jr. is possibly a campaign finance violation where it's unlawful to solicit anything of value from a foreign government and perhaps, depending on what happened in this meeting and frankly, I don't necessarily credit Don Jr.'s description of this meeting since he is lies about so much already, whether he solicited some sort of aid from the government.",
  "Emails preemptively released earlier today by Trump Jr. just before they were about to be published by The New York Times, in June 2016 Trump Jr. was explicitly offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the emails claiming to Trump Jr. that the incriminating information quote is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump unquote.",
  "BORGER: Would it have been illegal opo that he would have reported to the authorities, I mean the fact that he came from the Russian, might be something one would think you would report to the authorities in the first place, if you had gotten this kind of emails, you might pick up the phone and call your counsel, say what do I do about this?",
  "TAPPER: One of the things Adam Schiff hypothesized earlier today was this might have been a trial run to see how interested the Trump team might be were they to be offered damaging information, that it's entirely possible Schiff to be saying that the meeting went exactly the way Trump Jr. and others say it did.",
  "And whether Donald Trump Jr. was played or whether the intermediary was played or whatever, the Russians were trying to get in and see how far they could get into this Trump campaign and low and behold, this woman ends up with a meeting with three of the top people closest to the President -- to the candidate.",
  "See whether or not the law has been violated by the President or those around him but meanwhile we have seen today the knowing subversion of the interest of the United States by the son and son in law of the President of the United States when they took this meeting enthusiastically as it says in that email.",
  "The President's son, Donald Trump Jr. trying to defend himself and explain what is arguably the most incriminating piece of public evidence yet any investigation to the Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether there was any demonstrable collusion between the Trump team and the Kremlin.",
  "Let me ask you this, the New York Times is reporting this evening that the President's lawyer Marc Kasowitz might resign, is threatening to resign over frustration with Jared Kushner, because the feeling in The New York Times story is that Kushner might not be working with the President's team.",
  "CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Honest, earnest mistakes are one thing and we're talking about a malignant presidency of the United States and the reason, at the core of the malignancy has been lying throughout the presidency by the President, now we see by his son.",
  "He claimed there was nothing to tell but The New York Times is reporting this evening that President Trump was involved in the damage control about this story in recent days, signing off on his son's initial and incomplete account of his meeting with that Russian lawyer.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[23:23:05] TAPPER: A few hours ago President Trump sent his first tweet defending Donald Trump Jr. over today's release of the email chain, about that meeting about the Russian attorney calling his son quote a great person who loves our country.",
  "At this point the credibility of the President of the United States, members of his family and this is very much about his family and the Mr. Mueller is now focused in his investigation in part on Trump businesses and the family and the way the businesses are run.",
  "TAPPER: The Washington Post this evening also reporting that it's quite tumultuous in the White House right now, a Republican who is allied with the president referring to it as a category 5 hurricane that some people are calling for Reince Priebus to step down.",
  "I speak with Marc Kasowitz and my other co counsel in this case, pretty much every day, spoke to Mark yesterday, spoke to his partners today, so I don't know where is this coming from, but let me be really clear, Marc Kasowitz is the lead lawyer in this case.",
  "This is a real frustration right now talking to members who don't want to go out and criticize the President who are still tepidly behind him, their real concern he is causing so many distractions it's undercutting their one opportunity to get stuff done.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The onslaught of breaking news today, Donald Trump Jr. speaking out tonight trying to defend his decision to meet with a Russian attorney last year and admitting in retrospect he probably should have done things differently.",
  "Or should we report this to the FBI immediately because this is a country that doesn't have our best interest at heart and it's clear in this email they say that we have sensitive information as part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.",
  "Now there has been a report, I believe in Politico that Paul Manafort said he only read the first line of this email chain that said changed where the meeting was and where the meeting was, I wouldn't be surprised if Jared Kushner said the same thing.",
  "He said the White House is not reading that correctly but they are getting some receptiveness audience from members of the House of Republican leadership as well as others House Republican conference who are listening to the administration concerns.",
  "Don Jr. Would hand over anything that the FBI would like and said when it comes to these accusations he could have violated campaign finance law, there is an allegation that the Russian government wanted to hand over incriminating information.",
  "Congress is relatively hawkish, especially Republican on the issue of Russia and Russian sanctions, but right now there's a bill enabling -- keeping sanctions even tougher against Russia and it's kind of in a little bit of limbo in the house.",
  "TAPPER: And The New York Times is reporting that he signed off on the original statement that Donald Trump Jr. issued on Saturday, that one that required a follow-up clarification because it didn't disclose the idea of opposition research.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The act which was passed in 2012, I believe overwhelmingly enables the U.S. to sanction human rights abusers in Russia, people who have committed corruption, and horrible crimes against people there.",
  "If it there's a pattern, it can become quite serious and the thing that gets people nailed in Washington is false statements, it is -- this is a town filled with a-personality types that try to talk their way out of problems.",
  "The irony of that is something I think you have - this is the middle of a political season --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: It's not ironic and also the reason Donald Trump Jr. did it was because The New York Times was about to publish it.",
  "[23:10:11] Two, even if both issues were consequential, the idea of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, but also she dodge issues as she want Russian pushing for, they want to water down these sanctions.",
  "So is it fair to say that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort put the president in a disadvantage by not telling him about that meeting, because that answer -- if you take out the not that I know of.",
  "But the real concern is that Trump officials are raising concerns about a key provision that would essentially give congress the opportunity to veto any effort by the administration to loosen sanctions on Russia.",
  "It would encompass an enormous amount of political speech it would allow the federal government to investigate campaign just because they're receiving information from foreign sources like NGO's individuals.",
  "It escaped none of our attention that President Trump has been very restrained in his twitter and public comments about this while his beloved son is in the middle of this and I'm not making light of this.",
  "Goldstone spells out that the Russians were offering quote official documents and information's that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.",
  "TAPPER: My understanding to the dossier that was originally it was paid for by Republican opponents of President Trump in the primary, than Democratic wanted to President Trump, but that dossier.",
  "Whether it was my father, the rest of my family and the efforts that we put into, you know those efforts well, because we would do anything for this country, we would never put that in jeopardy.",
  "Just as a principal, if somebody says he wants to set up a meeting with your campaign because a foreign government wants to give information about arrival to that campaign, is that okay to do?",
  "JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think this Donald Trump Jr. meeting if he thinks a friendly interview on Hannity and the released of the email is going to put a fork in this, he is mistaken.",
  "GLORIA BORGER, AMERICAN POLITICAL PUNDIT JOURNALIST AND COLUMNIST: You know this puts to rest the question of whether the Russians were trying to influence the election to help Donald Trump.",
  "Coming back, I'm going to talk to one of the President's lawyers about one of President Trump's response to these meetings, to the emails and possible political and maybe legal consequences.",
  "Especially Jared who has an interim security clearance right now but has not been officially gotten a full security clearance yet and I assume that this is perhaps run of the reasons.",
  "Tonight CNN has learned that special counsel Bob Mueller is planning to investigate that meeting and that Donald Trump Jr.'s email exchanges will be part of the investigation as well.",
  "The Times is also reporting the emails were only discovered after Jared Kushner updated his security clearance form after initially failing to disclose his involvement in the meeting.",
  "[23:45:38] TAPPER: And what is interesting is, this is obviously not the first time that we have seen somebody from the Trump team misrepresent a conversation with a Russian national.",
  "And they said to reporters earlier this week they view it as 535 members of congress who believe they have greater commander and chief authority than the commander and chief himself.",
  "This was the middle of the campaign, a meeting was setup, a meeting that ends up where they evidently, purportedly ends up not being the case, opposition research on Hillary Clinton.",
  "They're going 20 hours a day and this is 20 minutes of one day and it ends up being nothing, so why would you go to the president and say we had a meeting and it results to nothing.",
  "TAPPER: An example of how many senate Republicans and how some house Republicans have a lot of concerns about President Trump and his views on Russia to say nothing about all this.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you say whether you are aware whether anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?",
  "I mean, I think Senator Warner said that today on the hill, man knew, and I think that we get in looking at what occurred a really a bird's eye view of just how they operate.",

  "DONALD TRUMP, THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing, so that is one person, but he was dealing as he should have been.",
  "And the final thing is this is the first meeting of many meetings we have reported on and the intelligence committees on the hill and special counsel are looking into.",
  "In fact many of the meetings that we have been reporting for months have taken place between Trump aids and Russians were not official Russian intelligence officials.",
  "But no court has taken information and said that is effectively a substitute for contributions and if they did, it would present a huge threat to the first amendment.",
  "TAPPER: President Trump was asked directly in February if he was aware of any contacts on the campaign between any Russians and anyone affiliated with the campaign.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Our correspondence and analysts are here to help us to sort through tonight's new revelations and analyze Donald Trump Jr.'s interview.",

  "Jeffrey Toobin let me start with you, has anything that has been revealed so far that show that anyone Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, any of them violated any law.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Obviously I don't think -- I assume he didn't mean getting an email getting information from the Russian government is pretty common.",
  "We look for anything that can cause further damage below the water line and this obviously came up in that review and they did notify that they had to amend.",
  "The senate judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley sending a letter to two senior Trump officials tonight saying how did this Russian lawyer get into the country?",
  "What do you mean the Russian government is trying to sell -- that might be a normal reaction, but --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Unfortunately that is all the time we have.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. did what any good lawyer and maybe it was your advice for all I know --\n\n\n\nSEKULOW: I don't represent Donald Trump but released was fine.",
  "One reason why that is being held up right now in negotiations, but expect this pressure campaign to Senate Republican to intensify in the coming days.",
  "But the point was to probe to find out would they be interested and this is exactly how Russia would do this, through this family friend of the Trumps.",
  "The top two Democrats asking for at least private testimony from Don Jr. who said in that Fox interview he is willing to cooperate, testify under oath.",
  "That is long shot but to answer your question simply no, I don't think there is any crime that has been uncovered specifically regarding this meeting.",

  "Certainly the special counsel will have far more questions to ask about this as will the house and Senate Intelligence Committees.",
  "It is amazing how this has unfolded and to Gloria's points how we continue to peel back layers of the onion in this investigation.",
  "Why would you do that, when they're having hundreds of meetings as I said, thousands of meetings over the course of the campaign?",
  "Jeffrey Toobin, Jonathan Turley, Carl Bernstein thank you so much, in a moment our correspondents are going to be looking ahead.",
