  "Blackwater founder Erik Prince, who has been linked to President Donald Trump in the past, has tried to convince the White House to go along with the idea that he said would employ 5,500 former special operations soldiers and an Air Force with 90 planes.",
  "\"The way the United Nations defines mercenaries, by being attached to the Afghan army, they would not be mercenaries,\" Prince told CBS, adding that it would drop the annual cost of the war from $45 billion to less than $10 billion.",
  "Prince made the rounds this week, speaking with USA Today and \"CBS This Morning\" about the idea, and insisted the private military contractors would not be mercenaries.",
  "\"So they would be contracted people, professionals, former special operations veterans that have experience in that theater to go do that work.\"",
  "Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., supports an idea that would employ a private Army and Air Force to conduct the war in Afghanistan.",
  "Prince, whose sister is Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, noted that the contractors would not conduct operations on their own.",
  "Rohrabacher's office told The Daily Caller the lawmaker backs a plan that's reportedly being considered by the White House.",
  "\"Imagine them as skeletal support on which each Afghan battalion is built around,\" Prince said.",
  "They are mentored in exactly this way by U.S. Special Forces.\"",
  "They conduct 70, 80 percent of the offensive missions.",
  "\"The Afghan special forces are functional.",
  "Story continues below video.",
  "They do well."
