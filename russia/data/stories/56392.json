  "Hilland, the FEC spokesman, said in a statement: “In exercising its regulatory and enforcement authority, the Commission uses a variety of methods to uncover possible election law violations including reviewing campaign finance reports, conducting financial audits of political committees, and investigating complaints filed with the agency by members of the public.”\n\nAfter the Wall Street Journal reported on the payments to Daniels in January, Common Cause filed a complaint later that month asking the FEC and Justice Department to investigate the payments.",
  "The president told Fox News, regarding Manafort, that “some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.” And Trump said Cohen’s “campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly.”\n\nIRS spokesman Leas, while not addressing the Manafort and Cohen cases, said the agency’s criminal investigation unit “uses sophisticated data analytics tools to detect fraud and identify criminal activity.",
  "Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman, said the agency has “spent significant effort” in the past year reaching out to entities that they believe should register under FARA, “and we have made our determination findings more fulsome.” This has led to a large increase in FARA registrations, he said, with the number jumping by more than 50 percent from 2016 to 2017.",
  "Financial crime has not diminished during that time — in fact, it has proliferated in the age of the internet, international financial crimes and virtual currency.”\n\nRepublicans and the Trump administration have resisted calls from Democrats to make the IRS pursue more fraud cases, arguing that the agency is bloated and needs to be overhauled.",

  "“That reminds campaigns and their lawyers and accountants that these are laws that have serious teeth, and that even though the odds of a violation being discovered may be small, the effect of discovering a criminal violation is life ruining.”\n\nSeung Min Kim and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.",
  "Manafort faces trial next month on violating FARA law, but a prior inspector general review concluded the FARA enforcement system had been frequently ignored by lobbyists in years past, partly because officials at the FBI and Justice Department had different notions of how such cases should be pursued.",

  "The Obama administration tried to bring more transparency to such entities, proposing in 2016 changes to federal law that would require people to disclose the “beneficial ownership” for limited liability companies.",
  "Such worries come amid a steady, multiyear decline in the number of financial fraud cases the government has pursued, erosions that began during the Obama administration after Republicans took control of Congress.",
  "But decisions by policymakers and lawmakers to defang regulation and defund investigations, particularly through political pressure aimed at the Internal Revenue Service, helped the behavior to go unnoticed.",
  "The use of obscure limited liability companies, which enables white-collar criminals to mask how they move money, presents particular challenges for federal investigators, former federal officials said.",
  "Paul Manafort’s multiyear tax fraud and Michael Cohen’s ability to easily arrange campaign contributions as hush money could have been intercepted sooner based on existing tax and campaign rules.",

  "“Their systems have gotten so weak,” said Paul Streckfus, a former tax lawyer at the IRS and editor of the EO Tax Journal, a newsletter that tracks the agency’s activity.",
  "The FEC now typically opens investigations only if there is a complaint, and the law requires approval from four of the commission’s six members to open an investigation.",
