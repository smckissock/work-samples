  "It's an excellent example of how to handle a massive crisis, and this is an enormous crisis - even more poignant because Google has a major product launch event tomorrow and because of Facebook's recent series of woes being so fresh in mind.",
  "There is still no public Tweet on the Google+ Twitter account or Google Twitter account as of writing, but Google will be watching the next 72-hours very carefully to determine strategy and determine the scope of the issue now it is out.",
  "The Google blog post goes through systematically the issues involved and outlines what is and isn't at risk; \"This data is limited to static, optional Google+ Profile fields including name, email address, occupation, gender and age.",
  "Details have surfaced that Google knew about a bug within Google+ (Google's attempt at a social network product) which would give nefarious outsiders potential access to private profile data from 2015 to mid-2018.",
  "It does not include any other data you may have posted or connected to Google+ or any other service, like Google+ posts, messages, Google account data, phone numbers or G Suite content.\"",
  "Both lack transparency because of future legal issues ahead, but Google's response appears (at first glance at least) to be more considered and above all, more definitive.",
  "Instead of admitting fault and pleading a case, the blog post treats the issue more like a learning experience and attempts to highlight almost why this is a good thing.",
  "Google chose not to disclose any details because of PR fears and blowback showing one thing; Facebook gets PR on a whole different level to Facebook.",
  "Alphabet has chosen to shut down the consumer arm of Google+ who released that 90 percent of Google+ user sessions were less than five seconds.",
  "There were other options available to Google, but this is pretty much what you'd expect with a breach of this kind and the current climate.",
  "The smell of regulation is in the air and Google knows this breach won't do anything but make media and political tummies rumble.",
  "Broken in The Wall Street Journal, the story has been covered massively and trended worldwide on Twitter.",
  "The post misses the point though, likely for legal reasons more than PR or image ones, and falls flat.",
  "While it is unclear what data has gone to whom and for what purposes, Google is on the PR offensive.",
  "Google is astutely aware that the company is a target for stories as much as hackers.",
  "In some respects, the former, at this time in history, could be far more damaging.",
  "It will be interesting to see how (and if) the breach is addressed.",
  "Google is about to have its own Cambridge Analytica moment.",
  "Strikingly different from Facebook PR in recent months.",
  "(See the full list on our developer site.)",
  "One line, in one place and in one time."
