  "AP\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his testimony this week in Washington that there was not a \"meaningful\" number of people who had deleted their Facebook account following revelations that data firms were able to steal personal information from millions of users.",
  "Facebook's main product hasn't changed that much in recent years, so perhaps, like Zuckerberg, they're reminiscing about a time when the company was run out of a Harvard dorm room and the key feature was the \"poke.\"",
  "So Carolina Milanesi and the technology research group Techpinions decided to survey 1,000 Americans, representative of the country in age and gender, about their feelings regarding the social-networking giant.",
  "At the same time, the hashtag \"#DeleteFacebook\" has trended following the Cambridge Analytica, and you may even personally know people who zapped their Facebook account.",
  "According to the study, two out of five people surveyed who had been on Facebook for over seven years wanted it to \"go back to how it was.\"",
  "Either way, Milanesi writes that lower engagement is actually the real risk for Facebook, not necessarily people deleting their accounts.",
  "Here are the big takeaways:\n\n17% of respondents said they deleted the Facebook app from their phone over privacy concerns.",
  "39% said they were \"very aware\" of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, while 37% said they were \"somewhat aware.\"",
  "Of course, there may be a gap between people who say they deleted their Facebook and those who actually did.",
  "35% said they were using Facebook less than they used to over the privacy issue.",
  "And Americans account for only a fraction of Facebook's user base.",
  "9% reported deleting their Facebook account altogether."
