  "Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer Getty\n\nIf you're meeting with Sheryl Sandberg in her private conference room at Facebook, you best not have anything negative to tell her, because the sign on the door forbids it.",
  "Unfortunately for Sandberg, NPR's Steve Inskeep didn't abide by the rules of the room, instead pressing her on the company's power and its respect for users privacy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",
  "That's the word from NPR's Morning Edition, which broadcast its one-on-one interview with the social networking company's chief operating officer on Friday.",
  "Obviously the sign on the door is meant as a playful placard, but it's an ironic reminder of the depth of the PR crisis the company now finds itself in.",
  "You can listen to or read Inskeep's full interview on NPR's Morning Edition site.",
  "\"Only good news,\" it reads."
