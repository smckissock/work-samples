  "As former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in 2002, the Iraq War would take “five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that.” When these wars did not end in mere months, the all-volunteer force found it could not recruit enough volunteers to sustain two long wars.",
  "Now, as President Obama prepares to hand off combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and elsewhere, to his successor, he’s also bequeathing a way of war that relies on large numbers of guns-for-hire while, at least formally, restricting the number of American “troops” sent overseas.",
  "When a squad of Blackwater contractors killed 17 civilians at a Bagdad traffic circle in 2007, it provoked a firestorm in Iraq and at home, marking one of the nadirs of that war.",
  "As a result, the government can put more people on the ground than it reports to the American people, encouraging mission creep and rendering contractors virtually invisible.",
  "Private military contractors perform tasks once thought to be inherently governmental, such as raising foreign armies, conducting intelligence analysis and trigger-pulling.",
  "For decades now, the centrality of contracting in American warfare—both on the battlefield and in support of those on the battlefield—has been growing.",
  "This big number signals a disturbing trend: the United States has developed a dependency on the private sector to wage war, a strategic vulnerability.",
  "The greater point is that America is waging a war largely via contractors, and U.S. combat forces would be impotent without them.",
  "Congress does not consider them to be troops, and therefore contractors do not count again troop-level caps in places like Iraq.",
  "Since 2009, the ratio of contractors to troops in war zones has increased from 1 to 1 to about 3 to 1.",
  "Contractors also encourage mission creep, because contractors don't count as \"boots on the ground.\"",
  "If this trend continues, we might see 80 or 90 percent of the force contracted in future wars.",
  "During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they constituted about 15 percent of all contractors.",
  "During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, policymakers assumed a quick and easy victory.",
  "During World War II, about 10 percent of America’s armed forces were contracted.",
  "Not surprisingly, both the Bush and Obama administrations opted for contractors.",
  "Second, institute a Vietnam-like draft to fill the ranks (political suicide).",
  "During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that proportion leapt to 50 percent.",
  "Only about 10 percent of these contractors are armed, but this matters not.",
  "First, withdraw and concede the fight to the terrorists (unthinkable).",
  "The U.S. government does not track contractor numbers in war zones.",
  "Today, America can no longer go to war without the private sector.",
  "Today, 75 percent of U.S. forces in Afghanistan are contracted.",
  "Their failures have an outsized impact on U.S. strategy.",
  "That left policymakers with three terrible options.",
  "Third, bring in contractors to fill the ranks.",
  "But don’t let the numbers fool you.",
  "Why did this happen?"
