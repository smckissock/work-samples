  "With less than a month to go until the caucuses, sources say, Braynard was still working to assemble a team to do what he described as a combination of high-level statistical analyses and “unglamorous political grunt work.” When one experienced data engineer asked when he could start working for the Trump campaign, Braynard immediately responded: “Now.”\n\nThe campaign didn’t start seriously building a data operation to target voters until mid-October, sources said, and even then it did not act with urgency.",
  "“The Iowa team did an amazing job with the tools that they had, but that’s like saying that Al Qaeda did an amazing job in a battle with the U.S. Army because some Al Qaeda fighters didn’t get killed.”\n\n***\n\nOn the ground in Iowa last month, Trump’s operation showed signs of disorganization and acrimony as it faced mounting doubts about its ability to identify and mobilize its high numbers of previously disengaged supporters and to persuade more traditional, but undecided, Republicans to caucus for Trump.",
  "He cast doubt on the ability of statistical models to microtarget New Hampshire voters, arguing that “to a certain extent you can’t predict who’s going to show up.”\n\nBut the campaigns with sophisticated data operations believe they can make a difference — and that the main question will be whether Trump's lead will be too big to overcome, or if the billionaire will, once again, fail to turn out enough of his avowed supporters to win a winnable race.",
  "“For all the talk over the last few years about the right being behind on voter ID and targeting, we’re experiencing a quantum leap forward right now.”\n\nHis group, which had been knocking on doors in Iowa for more than three months leading up the caucuses, has around 50 canvassers on the ground in upcoming states including South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri.",
  "Cruz and Rubio’s campaigns ran circles around Trump’s bare-bones operation, which gambled that Trump’s star appeal could overpower modern organizing tactics, and relied instead on big rallies, an outlandish social media presence, a flashy endorsement from Sarah Palin and a late advertising blitz to try to get supporters to the polls.",
  "Tranter’s team prides itself on having internal models showing that Rubio had more than 20 percent support from Iowan Republicans with a potential turnout scenario to surpass Trump for second place, much better than the final Des Moines Register poll, which had him with 15 percent support behind both Cruz and a leading Trump.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nTrump’s campaign lacked the voter-targeting and turnout capabilities to translate a 7-point polling lead in Iowa into a win in Monday’s Iowa caucuses, and his disappointing second-place finish hinted at potential trouble for him in upcoming states that should otherwise be more favorable.",
  "presumably mostly for the now-iconic hats bearing Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”\n\nThe campaign's lackadaisical data effort is seen in some quarters as coming down to Trump's lack of willingness to use his own cash on something that’s seen as essential in modern-day presidential politics.",

  "By the time his campaign began investing in voter data and targeting analytics, his rivals for the GOP nomination — particularly Iowa winner Ted Cruz and third-place finisher Marco Rubio — had spent millions building sophisticated voter-targeting machines.",
  "And, in early October, Trump’s Virginia state director, Mike Rubino, reached out to the nonpartisan voter data firm rVotes, writing in an email “We want to utilize this ASAP.” Steve Adler, rVotes' owner, said the Trump campaign never followed up.",
  "“He’s not going to spend any more money than he has to, and he made his bet.”\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether its Iowa turnout suffered from an underfunded voter targeting and mobilization operation.",

  "Trump’s backers maintain that the most painful part of his loss to Cruz, by a 3.3-percentage-point margin, is that it never should have happened.",
