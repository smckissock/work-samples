  "Photograph: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images More\n\nAccording to the president’s less-competent lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Trump himself paid Cohen a retainer to cover the $130,000 so generously handed over to Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election for a relationship Trump says never existed.",
  "That’s a total of almost $2.5m – as far as we know – paid to the deliciously titled Essential Consultants, the company also used to pay hush money to a porn star and a model on behalf of Donald J Trump and a donor.",
  "For a man who was meant to fix problems for Donald Trump, his personal lawyer has left an awful lot of problems unfixed\n\nDonald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen arrives at his hotel in New York City this week.",
  "Cohen also facilitated the payment of an astonishing $1.6m in hush money to another woman, Playboy model Shera Bechard – who had an abortion – supposedly on behalf of another man.",
  "They burn cash on glass-tabled conference rooms close to the White House, hugely inflated salaries for former congressmen, and steak dinners on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
  "Most of the coverage of this giant wheelbarrow of cash has focused on the corporate giants who were so happily fleeced by the fixer, until the deals became public.",
  "Cohen recently put up his $9m Park Avenue apartment as collateral, to back up reportedly as much as $12.8m of debt previously backed by his taxi medallions.",
  "This is not a good look for any self-respecting fixer, or for the large corporations that paid him millions for his insights into Trump’s inner thoughts.",
  "You might be forgiven for thinking his fixing was confined to mysterious payments to porn actors and Playboy models, in exchange for their silence.",
  "But the real mystery is not about the revenue: there are always suckers out there ready to believe the patter of a supposedly well-connected fixer.",
  "Michael Cohen, the most personal of the president’s personal attorneys, has cut an extraordinary figure in this totally abnormal administration.",
  "Now it’s true that his sideline business in taxi medallions has been more than a little distressed since Uber and Lyft burst on the scene.",
  "These are mind-grabbing, if not body-grabbing, stories involving actual sex, movies about sex, a president and one of his major donors.",
  "Some reporters claim these relationships and sums are normal in the influence-peddling business that thrives in the nation’s capital.",
  "But Elliott Broidy, now former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, apparently paid the money himself.",
  "But you would be wrong, because there are several public statements identifying other sources of cash for the hush money.",
  "But unlike fixers of yore, Cohen has been unable to fix anything without requiring a good deal of cosmetic after-fixing.",
  "Columbus Nova, an investment firm linked to the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, paid Cohen $500,000.",
  "AT&T now says the deal with Cohen was “a big mistake” and its head lobbyist is taking early retirement.",
  "Novartis blames its previous CEO for a relationship that involved all of one meeting with Cohen.",
  "Stormy Daniels speaks outside US federal court in Manhattan with her lawyer Michael Avenatti.",
  "But Essential’s known revenues are trivial compared with the scale of Cohen’s taxi troubles.",
  "That’s not true for Essential Consultants, whose staff amounted to one Michael Cohen.",
  "Most of the influence-peddlers have to support large teams and offices.",
  "AT&T paid Cohen’s firm $600,000 last year, while Novartis paid $1.2m.",
  "Michael Cohen’s story about the $130,000 payment to her has evolved.",
  "So it’s still not clear how Cohen spent as much as $2.5m last year.",
  "No, the unanswered questions are about where the money was going.",
  "Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters More\n\nThe fixer is in a fix.",
  "You’d think it was to pay off all those pesky women, right?",
  "Retainers of $100,000 a month are few and far between.",
  "Korea Aerospace Industries paid him a measly $150,000.",
  "What was the fixer doing with all that money?",
  "Rest assured, they are not."
