  "The Houston-based company is owned by Venezuela’s PDVSA, and operates three oil refineries and three pipelines in the U.S.\n\n“This could leave Rosneft, a company controlled by oligarchs with close ties to Vladimir Putin, in control of critical energy infrastructure in the United States,” the senators wrote.",
  "Sechin, one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, is among dozens of Russian citizens who are also sanctioned by the U.S. Tillerson, who in 2013 was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship by Putin, has recused himself from matters involving Exxon, according to the U.S. State Department.",
  "Exxon was blocked in 2014 from participating in the multi-billion dollar deal when the U.S. imposed the sanctions — which bar Russian investment in U.S. holdings and limit the ability of American companies to invest in Russia — after Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.",
  "“If you permit this deal to go ahead, it of course invites the question of why can’t other deals go ahead.”\n\nThe request raised eyebrows because the deal between Exxon and Rosneft was struck in 2011 while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was CEO of the Texas-based oil corporation.",

  "WASHINGTON — Exxon Mobil (XOM) will not be granted a waiver allowing it to resume drilling around the Black Sea in partnership with Russian state-owned Rosneft, the U.S. Treasury Department announced Friday.",

  "The Exxon deal is one of two transactions involving the Rosneft that have recently drawn scrutiny, along with calls for Treasury officials to intervene.",
  "The Treasury has not commented on the deal, which the lawmakers say should be reviewed for its national security implications.",
