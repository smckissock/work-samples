  "It's entirely likely that they're feeding the author of this report garbage, as often happens.”\n\nFor this reason, mainstream media outlets had generally shied away from reporting on the Steele dossier — until January, when CNN reported that US intelligence services had determined that Steele and his sources were “credible.” Top intelligence officials presented a summary of the dossier to Trump in an intelligence briefing.",
  "“This was managed of the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate’s campaign manager, Paul MANAFORT.”\n\nUS intelligence and law enforcement agencies are still investigating the dossier, parts of which have apparently been deemed credible, as well as the contacts between Trump associates and Russian intelligence that were identified by the New York Times.",
  "If Flynn was calling Kislyak to tell him that the Trump administration would roll back Obama’s new sanctions, then it would look like the Trump administration was attempting to immunize Russia from punishment for its interference in the US election and undermine the Obama administration, which was still in power at the time.",
  "One centers on Russia’s interference in the election, another centers on just-resigned National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s improper contact with the Russian ambassador after the election, and a third involves potential blackmail material Russian intelligence may or may not have on the president.",
  "The Times report cautions that there’s no evidence the Trump staff discussed Russian interference in the election — or that they even discussed Trump at all — and it doesn’t disclose whether any current administration officials were among the staffers who had been in contact with Russia.",
  "What we know for sure: Trump’s weird fondness for Russia has created fodder for years of investigation\n\nSo what we’ve got are three distinct, but connected, scandals — each unproven but credible enough that investigations from both the press and elements of the US government are ongoing.",
  "The Sessions news has raised questions even among Republicans on Capitol Hill — three leading Congressional Republicans have already called on Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation — so it’s possible more questions will come from that venue as well.",
  "Trump press secretary Sean Spicer and Vice President Mike Pence both separately told reporters that the calls were a friendly exchange that grew out of Christmas greetings — a questionable story given that Russian Orthodox Christmas was actually on January 9, 2017.",
  "“TRUMP’s unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so wished.”\n\nMost of this stuff is completely uncorroborated.",
  "He resigned in late August — right in the middle of the campaign — after a secret ledger was discovered with his name in it, suggesting he had quietly received $12.7 million between 2007 and 2012 from Ukraine’s pro-Russian former president, Viktor Yanukovych.",
  "But in a TV appearance the same day, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the president had been “loyal” to Flynn for the whole controversy, and that Flynn himself chose to resign on Monday night to put an end to the controversy.",
  "Arguably, doing so would have been illegal — an obscure 18th-century law, the Logan Act, prohibits people outside the executive branch from making foreign policy on behalf of the United States (though no one has ever been prosecuted under this act).",
  "This would suggest that Trump was basically fine with Flynn reaching out to Russia and discussing sanctions — that is, McGahn’s warning didn’t really matter to him — and that it was only the negative press that forced him to get rid of Flynn.",
  "On October 2, Stone sent a tweet hinting he had inside knowledge that WikiLeaks was about to torpedo Clinton’s campaign:\n\nFive days later, on October 7, WikiLeaks released the first tranche of emails hacked from top Clinton aide John Podesta.",
  "Even if no damning information is uncovered, continued press coverage will distract from Trump’s substantive agenda — and continued intelligence investigations will fuel his counterproductive, damaging feud with the intelligence community.",
  "Veteran journalist Dan Rather wrote in a Facebook post two weeks ago that the various controversies have the potential to become bigger than Watergate:\n\nOn a 10 scale of armageddon for our form of government, I would put Watergate at a 9.",
  "Put together, though, they point to one inescapable conclusion: Trump’s unprecedented friendliness with Russia’s dictator and willingness to tolerate staff with close Russia ties has already thrown his young administration into chaos.",
  "It also comes on the heels of the recent New York Times piece reporting that members of Trump’s campaign team and other “Trump associates” had “repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials” prior to the November vote.",
  "Spicer insisted, in a Tuesday press conference, that McGahn informed senior members of the administration back in January, and that their trust in Flynn had been deteriorating for weeks, culminating in a dismissal from Trump.",
  "Private cybersecurity firms and researchers have linked some of the code in the hack to known Russian operations; there’s consensus in the US intelligence community that Russia’s operation was designed in part to help Trump.",
  "“Source E, an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy between them and the Russian leadership,” Steele writes in the dossier.",
  "In August, longtime conservative political operative and close Trump confidant Roger Stone said that he was in touch with WikiLeaks, the source through which Russia released the hacked emails to the public.",
  "Late Wednesday night, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak twice during the 2016 campaign, when he was serving as a Trump advisor.",
  "It’s also possible that Flynn was acting with Trump’s blessing — that the Trump team knew about the call’s contents the whole time and then lied to the American people (and maybe even Mike Pence) about it.",
  "If that’s right, it means that Trump didn’t see Flynn’s call itself as a fireable offense, which in turn suggests that Trump at least tacitly approved of him reaching out to the Russians back in December.",
  "The Washington Post published a story confirming that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak about sanctions on December 29, and that FBI counterintelligence agents were investigating Flynn’s contact with Russia.",
  "A dubious dossier put together by a former British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele, claims there was an “extensive conspiracy” between Trump and the Russians to weaken the Clinton campaign.",
  "In late January, acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed White House counsel Don McGahn that she believed Flynn was deceiving the Trump administration about the contents of his call to Kislyak.",
  "This would be a much, much bigger scandal than the call itself — it would mean that the president or key members of his team deliberately hid the truth about the actions and policies toward Russia.",
  "Sessions’ meeting with Kislyak wouldn’t have been nearly as controversial (to the point where he may have lied about it under oath) had it not been for questions about Trump’s choices about Russia.",
  "It’s also possible that Flynn was acting alone but the Trump administration found out about his sanctions conversation before it went public — and then covered up the truth about it to save face.",
  "The most logical explanation, as my colleague Matt Yglesias explains, is that Trump did indeed fire Flynn, but did so only after the Post story exposed his lie about the sanctions call publicly.",
  "When huge elements of the administration are busy fighting fires, dealing with damning press leaks and congressional investigations, then they don’t have time to make major policy pushes.",
  "Flynn’s deception over what was and was not discussed during those calls has gotten Flynn fired — but the outstanding question is who else knew about Flynn’s calls and when they knew it.",
  "The report also suggested that Flynn had lied to Pence personally, telling Pence he hadn’t discussed sanctions with Kislyak, thus leading Pence to give false statements to reporters.",
  "Flynn has spoken very positively about the prospect of partnering with Putin’s regime to fight terrorism, and repeatedly appeared on Russia’s English-language propaganda outlet, RT.",
  "It’s theoretically possible that Flynn reached out to Kislyak on his own, without consulting any other Trump administration officials, and told him not to stress about sanctions.",
  "According to Steele’s sources, Trump did some very naughty things during his visits to Russia — like hiring prostitutes to pee on a hotel bed that President Obama once slept in.",
  "That’s because there isn’t just one scandal involving Trump and Russia: There are, roughly, three different allegations, which are connected but are each more or less distinct.",
  "Before he went, he tweeted this:\n\nDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?",
  "Suspicion fell on Russia almost immediately, given Trump’s pro-Russian approach to foreign policy and Russia’s long history of interfering in Western elections.",
  "“It’s not like these people wear badges that say, ‘I’m a Russian intelligence officer.’”\n\nTrump himself seemed to encourage Russian involvement in the election.",
  "In a July 2016 press conference, his final presser of the campaign, Trump publicly called on Russia to hack Clinton and publish emails from her private server.",
  "What we don’t know is whether there’s a connection between those two things — that is, whether the Trump camp knew about the Russian hack while it was ongoing.",
  "So far, they have only been able to corroborate insignificant parts of it, like whether one Russian official talked to another on the date listed in the memo.",
  "Flynn was so in with RT that he had been paid to give a speech at its 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow — where he sat at the head table with Putin himself.",
  "When news of the call first went public, on January 12, the Trump administration admitted that the two men spoke but denied that they spoke about sanctions.",
  "After the campaign was over, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov publicly admitted that members of Trump’s “entourage” were in touch with Russia.",
  "On December 29, the Obama administration announced a series of new sanctions on Russia as punishment for its interference in the US presidential election.",
  "As emails hacked from Clinton allies continued to leak to the press in a way that seemed designed to damage her campaign, these suspicions grew stronger.",
  "He called Flynn a “wonderful man” and said that \"it's really a sad thing\" that Flynn was treated “very, very unfairly” in press accounts of his actions.",
  "Right now, there’s no public evidence either in favor or against that — but some members of Congress have called for an investigation into the issue.",
  "“I cannot say that all of them, but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives,” he told the Russian news service Interfax.",
  "This is a devastating revelation, as Sessions is nominally in charge of the FBI — which is investigating the links between Trump’s team and Russia.",
  "Russian agents filmed these acts, according to Steele’s sources, and are wielding them to blackmail Trump into taking pro-Russian policy positions.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013\n\nThe point is that Trump, as a result of his business interests, has spent time in the country.",
  "This is despite the fact that Sessions said in his confirmation hearing that “I did not have communications with the Russians” — while under oath.",
  "He didn’t have to repeatedly praise Putin in public over the course of the past several years, or call on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails.",
  "FBI counterintelligence is still investigating Flynn, to see if Russia had any improper influence over him during his time in the administration.",
  "It’s likely that this investigation, together with whatever Congress decides to do, will give us more clarity on the real nature of Flynn’s call.",
  "The evidence comes entirely from testimony from anonymous sources, with little identifiable corroboration, and thus is very far from conclusive.",
  "Finally, we don’t really know why Flynn ultimately resigned from his post, as the line out of the White House varies from official to official.",
  "At this point, we don’t know who else in the administration McGahn told about Yates’s warning, or what they chose to do with that information.",
  "We know that Trump has had business dealings in Russia for years, going back to efforts to open a Trump hotel in Moscow during the Soviet era.",
  "The question of whether the American president assisted in a Russian effort to interfere with the democratic process is still very much open.",
  "That’s when Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, made a series of phone calls to Ambassador Kislyak (yes, him again).",
  "It stems almost entirely from anonymous allegations in the Steele dossier, and involves some deeply bizarre and hard-to-believe stuff.",
  "Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign manager at the time the first emails went public, also has longstanding ties to the Russian state.",
  "So here’s the million-dollar question: Did Trump, or anyone on his team, know about the hack targeting Clinton while it was going on?",
  "First, an unknown number of Trump campaign operatives and Trump-adjacent people were in touch with agents of the Russian government.",
  "Handling three separate ones at the same time — that’s exhausting, especially for a White House as famously disorganized as Trump’s.",
  "This Russia scandal is currently somewhere around a 5 or 6, in my opinion, but it is cascading in intensity seemingly by the hour.",
  "The scandals aren’t “fake news” or an intelligence community conspiracy; they stem directly from behavior by Trump or his staff.",
  "“The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation,” the Times reports.",
  "Two sources told the Post that Flynn had strongly implied that the Trump administration would be taking care of the sanctions.",
  "And there’s very little hard evidence to support the allegations — especially the more salacious ones — in the Steele dossier.",
  "This first scandal really got going after we found out about the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in June 2016.",
  "Manafort was the only Trump official identified by name in Tuesday’s New York Times report, though he denied the allegations.",
  "And did they plan their campaign strategy, which centered on “Crooked Hillary” and her emails, around Russian interference?",
  "Trump didn’t have to hire staff, like Manafort and Flynn, who had extensive and well-documented ties to the Russian state.",
  "The calls were intercepted by US officials monitoring Russian intelligence, who then leaked their existence to the Times.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\"",
  "Second, the Trump camp had no problem with Russian interference in the election, and at times seemed to welcome it.",
  "Trump officials are insisting that McGahn passed on the information to them quickly, but their story is confusing.",
  "When my colleague Sean Illing asked an ex-CIA analyst, Aki Peritz, about the memo, Peritz was deeply skeptical.",
  "That Flynn would call Kislyak was not, itself, surprising: Like Manafort, he had longstanding ties to Russia.",
  "Getting bills through Congress, or crafting executive orders that can survive court scrutiny, is hard work.",
  "And neither report explains what Sessions or the unnamed officials actually talked to the Russians about.",
  "\"Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump said.",
  "So for all we know, Sessions was one of many administration officials who had spoken with the Russians.",
  "Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance,” Steele writes.",
  "“I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers,” Manafort told the Times reporters.",
  "He didn’t have to propose policies, like weakening America’s commitment to NATO, that help Russia.",
  "Which, if true, would suggest that the administration has been lying to the public for weeks.",
  "The Post’s piece was the backbreaker for Flynn, who tendered his resignation on February 13.",
  "\"Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years.",
  "The US government is currently investigating each of these scandals, but none are proven.",
  "Basically, the Russian connection will be a problem for Trump for the foreseeable future.",
  "Handling one scandal with that kind of potential is tiring enough for an administration.",
  "None of this would be happening if Trump hadn’t decided to buddy up with Vladimir Putin.",
  "There is a smidgen of evidence outside of the calls to support cooperation allegations.",
  "The latest Sessions news shows that, without a doubt, Ryabkov was telling the truth.",
  "Trump’s own comments during a Wednesday press conference suggest this is the case.",
  "And we may look back and see, in the end, that it is at least as big as Watergate.",
  "Sine then, investigations into the dossier’s allegations have remained ongoing.",
  "The second Trump scandal begins after the election was over, around Christmas.",
  "Scandal 1: Did the Trump campaign collude with Russia against Hillary Clinton?",
  "So what do we know, exactly, about the scandals surrounding Trump and Russia?",
  "Even if Trump survives these scandals, it’s possible his policy agenda won’t.",
  "At this point, the evidence that Russia is responsible is pretty conclusive.",
  "If Trump hadn’t done these things, most of these scandals wouldn’t exist.",
  "There’s no confirmation, in the Times or Post reports, to support this.",
  "All roads here lead back to the same thing: allegations of a cover-up.",
  "Individually, the mere hint of any one of these scandals would be bad.",
  "In 2013, Trump traveled to Russia to host the Miss Universe pageant.",
  "Presidents only have so many resources and people at their disposal.",
  "It may become the measure by which all future scandals are judged.",
  "But it wasn’t the end of the trouble for the Trump administration.",
  "For starters, we still don’t know whether Flynn was acting alone.",
  "This third scandal is, by far, the least supported of the three.",
  "Both end up raising more questions than they answer as a result.",
  "There are varying degrees of public evidence for each of them.",
  "\"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"",
  "This is detrimental to Trump’s ability to pursue his agenda.",
  "It has all the necessary ingredients, and that is chilling.",
  "There’s long been circumstantial evidence to support this.",
  "And these Russia allegations are, make no mistake, huge.",
  "President Trump’s Russia problem is getting even worse.",
  "“We've no idea if any of this is true,” Peritz said.",
  "Scandal 2: Flynn lied about his overtures to Russia.",
  "That same day, Flynn called Kislyak multiple times.",
  "Watch: How Vladimir Putin won Republicans' approval",
  "Put this all together and two things become clear.",
  "And now his entire administration is lying in it.",
  "A fair amount — a disturbing amount, actually.",
  "The timing of the call, though, was an issue.",
  "Scandal 3: Does Russia have dirt on Trump?",
  "On February 9, this narrative fell apart.",
  "“We don't know who these sources are.",
  "This where the Steele dossier starts.",
  "And it’s all his own fault.",
  "Trump made his bed.",
  "Did Trump?"
