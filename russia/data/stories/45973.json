  "“Curiously, the same spirit who made sure that all military checkpoints in Dapchi and other surrounding towns were removed to pave [the] way for [the] abduction of the girls also made sure that the girls were returned without any security agent seeing them.” Newspapers and primetime TV shows began debating the “Dapchi scam.” Another theory making the rounds was that the insurgents had flown the girls to and from their hideout in jets — a belief fueled by a quote in an international outlet in which one of the girls said they were “flown in planes,” although that was clearly a translation error.",
  "“Even the Nigerian Nollywood filmmakers,” went another typical comment, referring to the country’s low-budget film industry that churns out extravagant plotlines, “would have helped Buhari and his cabal to script this ‘abduction’ to be more convincing.” Only after days of sustained media coverage of the conspiracy theories did the government explain why the release took part with no visible official presence: It was, apparently, the only precondition the abductors requested during negotiations to bring back the girls.",
  "“Especially when we have a local media that is not exactly concerned about discovering the truth, but will instead parrot whatever the various sides of any issue are all insisting on, and an international media that is often given to sensational reporting.” These theories are nurtured online but real harm takes place on the ground, where citizens might look to alternatives in the face of a government they can’t trust to protect or provide for them.",
  "A clue as to why trutherism has thrived in Nigeria lies in how the government aggressively attacked the report’s findings, saying “most of [Amnesty’s] narratives are outright falsehoods and a calculated attempt to whip up sentiments and mislead unsuspecting Nigerians.” “The Nigerian military fails to recognize that Amnesty International has immense credibility.",
  "Now, in Dapchi, truthers claimed the reverse was true: The Dapchi girls were all Muslims, which explained why Buhari or his loyalists had once again engineered a fake kidnapping and, more importantly, a successful release (except the sole Christian among them) — to show he, unlike a Christian president, had a firm grip on governing the nation.",
  "Ayodele Fayose, a vocal opposition governor from Ekiti state, declared the incident was a “drama scripted by the government and its agents to swindle Nigerians.” It was strange, he noted, that the girls could be brought back to Dapchi by their abductors without security officials knowing when they were returned and who returned them.",
  "Although the Dapchi abduction happened four years after Chibok, and under a different administration, the initial official response was eerily similar: denials the abduction had taken place were followed by bizarre false claims that 76 of the girls had been rescued, prompting celebrations in Dapchi’s streets.",
  "Up until the Dapchi girls were suddenly returned, no one had seriously questioned that the turbaned gunmen that night in February were militants from Boko Haram, a group whose nine-year-long quest to carve out a caliphate has left more than 30,000 dead across northeast Nigeria and the region.",
  "For President Muhammadu Buhari, it was a vindication of what he said just a few months after coming to power in 2015: that the war with Boko Haram was “finished.” Without a single shot being fired, without a ransom or a prisoner exchange, the girls been freed, according to the government.",
  "Boko Haram gradually splintered under the leadership of a notoriously violent hardliner called Abubakar Shekau, after some commanders balked at attacks on children in schools, the use of child suicide bombers, and the indiscriminate violence targeting both Christians and Muslims.",
  "He held long sermons urging the girls to “forget the infidels” — their family — they’d left behind, and ended by presenting them with “gifts.” On his first visit, after informing them their hijabs did not reach a Qur’an-approved length, Abu Khalifa brought them longer hijabs.",
  "For the public, though, doubts crept in over the government’s insistence a ransom hadn’t been paid, especially since the release of 103 of the girls from Chibok in 2017 came on the back of a $3 million payment, and an exchange of five top commanders who had been imprisoned.",
  "Aminu Abubakar / AFP / Getty Images Yobe State Governor Ibrahim Gidan (right) speaks with Information Minister Lai Mohammed and the head of the military force fighting Boko Haram, Major General Rogers Nicholas, on the premises of the school after the girls were abducted.",
  "“Why would a conquered enemy still have the ability to move with the force and self-assurance we saw Boko Haram displaying on videos...?” What should have been a triumphant case closed for the government instead turned into a gift for the conspiracy-minded.",
  "Equally mystifying was the government’s claim that the children’s release had been secured with just one condition from their abductors — that the kidnappers could return the hostages to the town themselves without being captured or coming under fire.",
  "Their kidnappers, she said, were an elderly man with a graying beard who the girls nicknamed “Baba” — meaning uncle — and a younger, light-skinned man who looked like the Fulani herders whose cows often grazed just beyond her family’s mud-walled home.",
  "For many ordinary Nigerians, it seems easier to believe the whole event was orchestrated in order to boost low government approval ratings rather than accept that, once again, more than 100 girls had been abducted from their school dormitory.",
  "And it took further public pressure before a military spokesperson offered an explanation for the sudden withdrawal of security forces from Dapchi before the attack — a point many truthers see as compelling evidence of government collusion.",
  "Well-known anti-government critics spent weeks decrying the “scam.” Some, such as Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister whose outlandish claims have often sparked controversy, narrowed in on obscure details, many of which are outright untrue.",
  "That would be nothing new — when the Chibok girls were taken in 2014, trutherism reached the highest levels of government, with the then-president’s wife claiming the abduction was part of a smear campaign designed to unseat her husband.",
  "The story of the Dapchi kidnapping is an extreme version of something happening across the globe — it shows what happens when citizens don’t trust their government, and the idea of an objective truth is fractured along partisan lines.",
  "The implication that the kidnappers hadn’t known they were abducting Muslims was puzzling, not least because the girls’ release later seemed to hinge on that fact, but Maisamari was too busy scanning the arrivals to think it through.",
  "Unlike during Nigeria’s most infamous kidnapping — when 276 girls were snatched from Chibok, launching the #BringBackOurGirls movement — there was no boastful video, no contact with the media, and no proof of life ever given.",
  "But officials didn’t say when the handover took place or provide any proof it had happened, while the state police commissioner said he had never received any kind of official notification his men were supposed to take over.",
  "For years, the government has exaggerated battlefield successes while aggressively attacking those who point out holes in official narratives — meaning public trust has eroded to a point where people will believe anything.",
  "It is therefore likely that local Boko Haram members or supporters alerted the kidnappers to the absence of security forces in Dapchi,” said John Campbell, a former US ambassador to Nigeria who now runs a security blog.",
  "But this being 2018, a year in which Nigerians learned the data firm Cambridge Analytica ran a campaign intended to portray the president as a Boko Haram sympathizer, the conspiracies have taken on virulent proportions.",
  "Those shouting the loudest that the government had carried out the abduction were, unsurprisingly, opposition figures, and in another time might have been dismissed as partisan rabble-rousers ahead of elections in 2019.",
  "The notion of “alternative facts,” newly introduced to the West by the Trump administration, is one that’s been peddled for years by politicians in Nigeria, rushing in to fill a vacuum created by fear and discontent.",
  "For most of the past decade, Nigeria’s government has tried and largely failed to strike peace accords with Boko Haram, whose leadership is obscure and whose bloodthirsty strategy is often confusing.",
  "https://t.co/wajHHCaGUd\n\nInstead, the information minister, Lai Mohammed, claimed the abductions were simply a mistake made by Boko Haram, with whom the government was conducting back-channel talks.",
  "It was the same government official as before, who asked him if there was “any news.” “I said, ‘Boko Haram started bringing the girls.’” The officer told him he was aware of that, Maisamari said.",
  "In Dapchi itself, far from social media or any kind of decent working internet, residents were finding new ways to cope with the reality that their government simply can’t guarantee their safety.",
  "In Nigeria, trutherism is instead a logical conclusion to the numbness of repeated tragedies — Boko Haram is just one of several insurgencies ravaging the country — and failures of government.",
  "In a country whose 180 million population is split roughly in half between Muslims and Christians, the truthers fell on both sides of the religious divide, and could be found even in Dapchi.",
  "In a scathing report, Amnesty International documented how increasingly frantic villagers had called security officials to warn them a convoy of Boko Haram fighters were heading to Dapchi.",

  "Afolabi Sotunde / Reuters Major General Rogers Nicholas carries one of the newly released Dapchi schoolgirls as others wait to board a plane at the air force base in Maiduguri, Nigeria.",
  "So instead of you to run, it’s better you people thank us.’” “So I said, ‘Okaaay, if that’s the case,’” he said, clapping his hands together and feigning a bow of obsequious gratitude.",
  "This was the residential block of Dapchi Girls Science and Technology College, a government-run school where dozens of girls aged 10 to 18 were preparing to settle down for the night.",
  "When the schoolgirls came streaming out, the gunmen bundled them into the truck and took them to their hideout in a swampy border region around Lake Chad — three days’ drive away.",
  "“You know, I have to thank them, even if I hate them internally.” Maisamari approached the man who seemed to be their leader and asked if all the girls were going to be returned.",
  "It’s entirely possible that Boko Haram simply exploited the security lapse — indeed, many saw the Chibok abduction as an opportunist kidnapping rather than anything premeditated.",
  "The men gave highly specific instructions about how the town’s girls should be educated: “The first thing you are going to do, go and marry the older ones,” they told residents.",
  "How have millions of Nigerians become convinced that their own government — still dogged by the #BringBackOurGirls campaign to return the Chibok girls — staged a mass abduction?",
  "But in the West, hardcore conspiracy theorists tend to remain a fringe who are clearly deflecting their own fear of random chaos on to the grieving relatives of murder victims.",

  "“If not because I’m too elderly, I would have run away,” the 65-year-old said, pointing to the corner where the truck arrived, just a few dozen yards away from his own home.",
  "Later, she would learn they had been taken to Tabichadi — meaning “waters of Lake Chad,” an island-strewn lake that spans Nigeria and neighboring Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.",
  "Overhead, the hum of an aircraft — Hajara had only ever seen them on TV so she couldn’t tell whether it was a plane or helicopter — faded in and out throughout the night.",
  "They then loitered in front of the town’s police station to change a burst tire, eyewitnesses told BuzzFeed News, before disappearing once more into the surrounding bush.",
  "Later, something else strange dawned on him: the apparent absence of police or military officials, whose patrols had otherwise increased in the days after the abduction.",
  "Finally, after wading across streams and crossing rivers in canoes, the group disembarked on a grassy island shore where the militants then planted a large black flag.",
