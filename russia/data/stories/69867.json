  "(In August 2016, he wrote to Republican Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a former CIA officer, urging a congressional inquiry into \"Russian abuse of…LinkedIn to achieve a national security advantage over the U.S.\")\n\nCobaugh and other military and intelligence veterans and academics coalesced on LinkedIn in 2015 to combat dezinformatsiya, or disinformation, a branch of what Russian intelligence calls \"active measures,\" the tactic of spreading false rumors that the Kremlin has employed since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.",
  "Dianova countered in a LinkedIn post that she had \"NEVER [her capitalization] asserted…that Mr. Leven 'engaged in theft,'\" but merely \"ASKED him whether or not it is true that he had misappropriated the government funds.…\" She also wrote that another account of the case \"contains NOTHING to counter the allegation…that 'Charles Leven, had pocketed some of the money.…\" In fact, the article didn't even mention the incident.",
  "\"A group of about 40 of us from the West began exchanging notes,\" says Joel Harding, who retired from the U.S. Army's Intelligence and Security Command in 2003, \"and we noticed a few of the profiles [on LinkedIn] were consistently not engaging us [in debate] but rallying the troops\"—the defenders of Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, critics of NATO, Trump-style European populists and the like.",
  "Top U.S. intelligence officials say there's no reason to believe the Kremlin will pull back: \"Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the [2016] U.S. presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide,\" they concluded in their January 2017 report, \"including against U.S. allies and their election processes.\"",
  "Leven, who spent over three decades recruiting Russian agents, says he does \"not believe she is a Russian intelligence staff officer\" but rather just another well-connected Moscow figure whom the Kremlin uses to send messages, like the Russians who got a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials do deliver \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton.",
  "Commentary on pro-Kremlin propaganda sites like Russia Insider, a website founded in 2014 to combat \"coverage of Russia [that is] is biased and inaccurate,\" labeled him a \"suspected pedophile\" and pushed a long-discredited, KGB-generated story accusing him of embezzling funds from one of his Cold War-era Russian spies.",
  "Back online, DeMourot and his fellow Kremlin critics felt LinkedIn was inclined to accept the other side's charges—and not theirs—even though they say many of their foes were hiding behind suspected multiple fake identities (including Russians posing as pro-Trump Americans), a violation of LI's User Agreement).",
  "On LinkedIn, Harding was also labeled a \"pornographer\" (a favorite meme used against Hillary Clinton and associates) following a lawsuit against him by a Malibu Media, a notorious Los Angeles company that lures browsers into clicking on links to X-rated movies then demands payment for \"illegally\" copying them.",
  "\"It is a new and open issue as to whether our kind of self-government can function successfully when…much of the electorate gets its news from social media easily employed by foreign powers,\" two top former White House cybersecurity officials, Richard Clarke and Robert Knake, wrote recently in Politico.",
  "Experts have increasingly called attention to Russia's use of covert \"propaganda factories\" to subvert democracy, flooding Twitter and Facebook with millions of computer-generated bots posting under false names (often unwittingly picked up and amplified by supporters of Donald Trump).",
  "She also leveled insults against her critics via LinkedIn and well-known Kremlin propaganda sites like the Russian International Affairs Council, a \"soft power\" arm of the Kremlin founded by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and chaired by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.",
  "The platform's \"mobile application remains available both in the AppStore and in Google Play, and the network's e-mail service continues delivering messages sent via its website,\" Nabi Abdullaev, a senior analyst at the Control Risks security firm wrote last December in Forbes.",
  "\"The Russian special services are for sure exploiting LinkedIn to gather personal information on certain targets and possibly recruit and blackmail them,\" says a close Kremlin watcher at a university in a former Soviet satellite state, asking for anonymity to protect himself.",
  "But in April, his company produced a report on its own investigation, saying it \"does not contradict\" the finding of U.S. intelligence that \"information warfare\" ordered by Putin was carried out on Facebook and other social media sites—despite their best efforts to stop it.",
  "The report said Facebook had \"observed many actions by fake account operators that could only be performed by people with language skills and a basic knowledge of the political situation in the target countries, suggesting a higher level of coordination and forethought.\"",
  "Yet when Berger asked LinkedIn to remove Dianova's \"defamatory\" post on Leven's alleged espionage embezzlement, \"Scarlett\" cited a section of the Communications Decency Act that said \"we are not responsible for such content, even when it's alleged to be defamatory.\"",
  "A North Korea attack would take out Los Angeles, Chicago or New York, and be the deadliest in U.S. history\n\nRussia investigation: Jill Stein explains her relationship to Putin, Trump and Hillary Clinton\n\nLinkedIn provides a rich hunting ground for Russian agents.",
  "\"Most of the Russian trolls are still active on LinkedIn,\" says the Eastern European expert on Russian internet practices, who supplied Newsweek with web addresses and screen shots of dozens of alleged fake users spouting anti-Western and pro-Kremlin messages.",
  "Such techniques have worked all too well with the rise of the Moscow-friendly Trump, whose tweets denouncing investigations into contacts between the Russians and his campaign aides and family members have found a friendly echo chamber in social media sites.",
  "In a flurry of emails with Newsweek, Dianova offered to provide \"a compilation\" of \"everything Charles Leven and his collaborators\" have written about her—but only \"in exchange\" for Newsweekrevealing its sources to her with screen shots of their comments.",
  "There, however, Newsweek has found that pro-Moscow forces have put constant pressure on the company to suspend or permanently evict a number of its adversaries, many with long, distinguished careers in the U.S. military or its intelligence agencies.",
  "Not only has this muzzled credentialed critics and damaged professional reputations, but if Malcher's suspicions were right, the Kremlin's campaign to combat its adversaries on social media may have moved beyond cyberspace and into the streets.",
  "The stranger's comments, delivered with a thick Slavic accent, made Malcher's security antennae vibrate: He had recently joined a Washington, D.C.–based think tank involved in combatting Russia's stealthy infiltration of American social media.",
  "One of the most persistent critics of Leven and his cohorts was Yana Dianova, a top international law expert with ties to Roskomnadzor, the Russian internet regulator that censorsopposition parties and foreign news reports critical of Moscow.",
  "In a June 27, 2016, LinkedIn post, she wrote that she had compiled a \"list of at least a dozen\" of her enemies, \"with [their] background and contacts details, adding that \"those whose job is to survey these activities are aware of them.\"",
  "A key feature of the online effort was trolling, the tactic of injecting inflammatory, off-topic commentary into discussion groups and threads with the goal of defaming critics, provoking fights and chasing away thoughtful adversaries.",
  "Still working as a defense and foreign policy consultant for private clients, DeMourot had been writing exposés of alleged Russian intelligence front groups and agents in France and Belgium \"with names, places and dates\" on LinkedIn.",
  "Beyond her legal work, Dianova used LinkedIn and other media to insinuate that the bogus KGB embezzlement story about Leven had merit and suggested that Harding, the \"porn addict,\" had done time in a \"a maximum correctional prison.\"",
  "\"Americans, she wrote on LinkedIn, \"may vehemently claim that they are Russian propaganda fighters but [what] they actually do 24/7 here is quite similar to…CIA and other U.S. government social media trolls/disinformation programs.\"",
  "To DeMourot, the attack was a disquieting replay of a Cold War–era, Russian KGB assault on Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident who died in 1978 after being injected with a poison pellet from an umbrella jab on a London street.",
  "She frequently employed a favorite Kremlin rhetorical tactic, \"whataboutism,\" or responding to exposés of Moscow's interference in the 2016 elections with counter-narratives of U.S. support for pro-democracy groups in Russia.",
  "The company offers clients advice on the Russian gas and oil sector, as well as guidance on real estate investing in Cyprus, an area of \"primary concern\" for money laundering, according to a 2014 U.S. State Department report.",
  "\"There's no way he could have known that except via LinkedIn,\" Malcher says, referencing the professional online networking site where he and other critics of Moscow had been active in international affairs discussion groups.",
  "There, foreign affairs specialists from academia and the government post mainstream media articles and commentary, frequently on the subject of Russia's so-called \"hybrid warfare\" tactics against NATO members and applicants.",
  "A few days before Malcher was approached in a London pub in March, a former U.S. national security official who had been contesting Kremlin propaganda on LinkedIn says he was assaulted near his retirement home in France.",
  "To Leven, Demourot, Harding and their comrades, such commentary was just another front in a larger Russian media campaign that veteran Kremlin-watcher Celestine Bohlen had called\"breathtaking, even by Soviet standards.\"",
  "As the rhetorical combat between the Americans and the Russians accelerated through 2016, DeMourot says he continued to see real world consequences (though he does not allege these consequences were related to Dianova).",
  "She has regularly threatened to sue anyone who repeats the allegation, but in a response to one critic who floated the idea that she and her law firm had intelligence connections, she cracked, \"Thanks for the free PR.\"",
  "\"In many cases,\" The Atlantic noted, \"such information operations are aimed at gaming Facebook's algorithm, using tactics like the mass creation of fake accounts and the creation of groups populated by those accounts.\"",
  "After being retained by Leven, Berger sent written protests to LinkedIn's Department of Trust and Safety, as well as senior executives at LinkedIn and Microsoft, which acquired the site for $26.2 billion in June 2016.",
  "\"If we receive a report of a false profile or harassment of a member, we investigate…with our user agreement and professional community guidelines in mind,\" LinkedIn spokeswoman Mary-Katharine Juric tells Newsweek.",

  "Immediately recognizing them as \"rogue\" former British commandos, whom he knew were working for an alleged Kremlin agent he had written about on LinkedIn, he suspected the email had come from a hijacked account.",
  "Unlike Twitter and Facebook, most of its estimated 500 million, predominantly white-collar subscribers use it to advertise their expertise, seek employment or engage with peers in expert-based discussion groups.",
  "\"I've never been barred, even though I have been just as hard on the Kremlin as anyone else,\" says Kandy Zabka, a cybersecurity specialist who has done work uncovering hackers for the FBI, Interpol and Europol.",
  "Others have taken her place, while fake Russian accounts, in many cases computer-generated bots from Russia's \"propaganda factories,\" continue to plague LinkedIn and other social media platforms, observers say.",
  "It also occurred around the time that the Moscow-backed hackers stole and promulgated embarrassing private emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta.",
  "A representative of LinkedIn's Department of Trust and Safety using the name \"Scarlett\" accused them of \"repeatedly posting unwanted/inappropriate content, and using the platform to harass other members.\"",
  "He says he once got a tip from a source in the Paris municipal government that a man \"with a Russian accent\" had tried to get confidential information about his company from the city's business records.",
  "Other critics have been attacked with poison too, notably an ex-KGB officer turned freelance investigator named Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after a Kremlin agent laced his tea with polonium.",

  "A senior attorney in the Moscow office of Grata International, a firm based in Kazakhstan, Dianova has participated in two Roskomnadzor conferences, which are attended by senior security officials.",
  "\"In 2015 through 2016, Yana began making complaints\" to LinkedIn management, says Harding, \"calling us trolls, sending the screen shots in as evidence, getting a few of us temporarily restricted.\"",
  "Like virtually all U.S.-based social media sites, LinkedIn was looking to expand abroad, including Russia, where it had a tenuous foothold with 6 million customers in 2016, according to Reuters.",
  "DeMourot points to the case of Fred Eidlin, whom he calls \"an ardent and virulent pro-Russian propagandist\" who was active mainly in another LinkedIn discussion group, Political Science.",
  "The evictions were first reported a year ago by Kseniya Kirillova, a Russian-born journalist who fled Ukraine for the U.S. last year under death threats and applied for political asylum.",
  "DeMourot promptly copied the email to LinkedIn's Department of Trust and Safety, with a complaint that Eidlin was in \"flagrant violation of its terms of use\" by misrepresenting himself.",
  "A major target was Charles Leven, a highly-decorated retired senior CIA operations officer with over 40 years' experience jousting with the Russian KGB and its successor spy agencies.",
  "The pro-Moscow campaign has recently expanded—and, in some cases, gone offline—allege some American LinkedIn members who have been criticizing Russia's covert attacks on the West.",
  "Unfortunately, Wu argued, social media companies \"lack a serious financial incentive to do anything about…the millions of fake users who are corrupting the democratic process.\"",
  "But others in the International Relations discussion group remain banned, including Leven and his attorney Berger, who received permanent membership bans without explanation.",
  "Paul Cobaugh, a former U.S. Army psychological warfare expert, says the accounts of DeMourot and Malcher sound right to him: \"When I see influence operations, I know them.\"",
  "By raising unfounded questions about their backgrounds and credentials, DeMourot and the others complain, Dianova was \"trolling,\" a violation of LinkedIn's user agreement.",
  "(DeMourot supplied a hospital document confirming the wound was caused by \"wooden splinters\" and that \"only an outside intervention [event] can explain the infection.\")",
  "Cobaugh, who retired from the U.S. Special Operations Command in 2015, has also been harassed by Russian trolls on LinkedIn after posting comments critical of Moscow.",
  "Such activities were designed to help Donald Trump and \"undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,\" an American intelligence report concluded in January.",
  "\"Our group consists of real professionals, many of whom have long track records of public service, military service and/or work in fields such as law,\" Berger says.",
  "\"Both U.S. and Russian intelligence officials agreed the story was a fabrication,\" Leven points out, citing authoritative books and a magazine articleon the affair.",
  "\"I was shopping at the local supermarket when I was stung on my lower-right thigh by something, probably with an umbrella,\" Giles Raymond DeMourot tells Newsweek.",
  "That provides fodder for Russian intelligence to gather detailed information on its most formidable critics and cast doubt on the truth of those accomplishments.",
  "An expert in information warfare, Malcher reasoned that the Kremlin had dispatched the stranger to the Queen's Arms with a message: We know everything about you.",
  "\"Their allegations that I am somehow acting on behalf Russian government authorities/its agents,\" she adds, \"are totally false, crazed and made out of revenge.\"",

  "To bolster their credentials, most—even current and former U.S. national security officials—post detailed résumés and recommendations from their colleagues.",
  "Whatever the value of the Russian market, Moscow booted LinkedIn on November 17 because it would not agree to move its data servers under Russian control.",
