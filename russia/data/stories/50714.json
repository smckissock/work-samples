George.",

  "On Oct. 17, 2009, my photo appeared on the front page of my local newspaper, the Tennessean, with the quote: “Carol Swain is an apologist for white supremacists.” That was Mark Potok, at the time the SPLC’s national spokesman.",
  "The context for Mr. Potok’s attack was a review I gave for a film titled “A Conversation About Race.” I endorsed it for classroom use because it offered a perspective on race rarely encountered on university campuses.",
  "The attacks did not subside until this newspaper’s website published a lengthy article titled “In Defense of Carol Swain.”\n\nBeing targeted by the SPLC has had a lasting impact on my life and career.",
  "Yet today I wear the SPLC’s mud as a badge of honor because I know I am in the company of many good men and women who have been similarly vilified for standing for righteousness and truth.",

  "I wrote: “Rather than monitoring hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has become one.”\n\nThe SPLC’s retaliation was vicious and effective.",
