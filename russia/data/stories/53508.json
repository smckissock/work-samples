  "Rob Goldstone, the Donald Trump Jr. acquaintance who brokered the meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, the day after the 2016 US election: pic.twitter.com/20bMLUvDiH — Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) July 9, 2017\n\nIt's worth noting that Goldstone has defended himself by saying that the meeting was made at the request of his client, Russian entertainer Emin Agalarov (who is the subject of many a Goldstone social media post and who made a music video that includes a cameo from President Trump).",
  "\"The lawyer (Veselnitskaya) had apparently stated she had some information regarding illegal campaign contributions to the (Democratic National Committee) which she believed Mr. Trump Jr. might find important,'' Goldstone said in a statement provided to USA TODAY.",
  "And he's been pretty outspoken about his love for Russia – where he travels frequently for work – which is drawing more scrutiny since the news that he arranged the meeting for Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-backed attorney.",
  "Buzz60\n\nRob Goldstone is now in the eye of the Russia investigation storm, and there's one thing we can tell you right off the bat about the entertainment publicist: The man is an avid social media user.",
  "But scroll back to June 2016, and you'll see that Goldstone checked into Trump Tower on the day the meeting took place:\n\nWithin the hour, he then checked into the Trump Organization.",
  "His Facebook profile is full of public post after post about his glitzy lifestyle: check-ins to high-profile places and jetting around the world.",
  "The next month, after a trip to Moscow, he made sure that people knew he was no fan of Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee.",
  "And the day after the 2016 presidential election, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram sporting a shirt featuring the word \"RUSSIA.\"",
  "As several journalists have noted, he even touted the meeting he arranged between Trump Jr. and the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya.",
  "CLOSE The man behind the meeting between Trump Jr and that Russian lawyer appeared to have publicized it on his Facebook.",
  "\"I reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and he agreed to squeeze us into a very tight meeting schedule.''",
  "Goldstone has also posted several times about Donald Trump, both as a candidate and as a president.",
  "According to The Guardian, the caption on the photo read, \"Hedging bets.\"",
  "The posts themselves aren't as explicit as that, of course.",
  "And for what it's worth, he goes to Moscow for work.",
