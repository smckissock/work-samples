  "Now, yes, right, just like there's truth in that phony, unverified, uncorroborated, debunked dossier that the Clinton campaign used to smear then candidate Donald Trump, the same Russian lies that were used before the election as the foundation for the Mueller witch hunt and the op research used to mislead a FISA court on four, not one, but four separate occasions, four judges, so the government literally could spy on an opposition party candidate and Trump campaign associate.",
  "HANNITY: And then after the election, they are trying to drag him back in, through the fourth highest ranking Justice Department official whose wife, incidentally, we believe -- we know she worked for Fusion GPS, but we believe on the phony Russian dossier and they're trying to bring him back because after Trump won and his dossier lies didn't work, then they were trying to take out the president with more Russian lies, correct?",
  "Months after Christopher Steele was discredited and terminated by the FBI because he has leaked to the media, a major violation of human source intelligence rules, there was an effort underway by him with his buddy Bruce Ohr, at that time a top deputy to Rod Rosenstein, to try to get him back into the FBI's good graces and possibly get him working, reengaged it says is the word used in this emails with special counsel Mueller.",
  "MCCARTHY: I just don't understand why at this point -- look, in 99 percent of investigations investigative secrecy is a very important priority because most cases don't involve the president of the United States, but I think at this point, two years down the road we are entitled to know if the special counsel has a case and he should be -- he should have to come forward and show what the crime is.",
  "And meanwhile, Manafort's attorneys once again called out what is the questionable character of the star witness Rick Gates, pointing out that he had up to four extramarital affairs on top of, oh, let's see, embezzlement, lying, extortion and could have faced if he didn't get the free -- get out of jail free card from Mueller, could have faced 290 years in jail.",
  "HANNITY: Let me ask you, I had a source of mine recently tell me that drones are being used by drug cartels out of Mexico and they use the drone to find out where our law enforcement is positioned so that those that are either involved in human smuggling or drug smuggling, that they will know which direction, which route to take that is the most safe for them.",
  "After all, remember, WikiLeaks, they were the ones that actually released those hacked emails and unlike so many other so-called journalist here in America, we took the time, we went to England, we sat down and we interviewed Julian Assange right here on the show and on my radio show and he said to us then, no government actor was involved in the hacking.",
  "And while team Mueller is embarrassing themselves attempting to put the screws on Manafort as Judge Ellis said to get him to sing or compose against President Trump so they can impeach or prosecute him, well, it's Mueller's prosecutors who were actually feeling the heat from the presiding judge, T.S.",
  "Now, meanwhile, according to a brand-new report from our own Sara Carter, a post-election 2016 handwritten document from Bruce Ohr listing the names of Strzok and Page and others in the FBI is also raising questions tonight about the extent of Ohr's communications with the bureau.",
  "SOLOMON: The only reason to bring Christopher Steele back into the investigation that we can see in these documents is to sustain an inaccurate narrative in the public domain that they had this extraordinary evidence against President Trump that he was colluding with Russia.",
  "Now, it doesn't appear in these things that we can prove they ever got to Mueller, but the mere fact that a senior Justice Department official was trying to get a discredited partisan intelligence source back on to the case tells you all you need to know about this case.",

  "NIELSEN: Well, it's not -- it's not just that, but let's face it, when we are talking about the technology we have today, these drones can fly up to 100 miles per hour so the concept of using an antiquated law to get a warrant to stop a nefarious drone is ridiculous.",
  "That's more than a year after the FBI supposedly officially cut off all ties with Christopher Steele because he was leaking and lying about potentially classified information to the media again to peddle his lies to influence the outcome of our election.",
  "In a statement, the attorney for President Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote: We are restating what we have been saying for months, it is time for the office of the special counsel to conclude its inquiry without further delay.",
  "That is what they were working for, that is what they continued to do and that is what they were semi-successful, at because what they got, the end result -- Comey got it when they appointed special counsel Robert Mueller based on this evidence.",

  "And according to some other newly unearthed texts tonight, we are also learning he was concerned about the U.S. Senate's inquiry into the dirty dossier, probably because the contents were full of Russian lies and outright propaganda.",
  "HANNITY: But the president has the power to go through these documents to the FISA and make it un-redacted and let the American people see that the bulk of information was what Christopher Steele himself said wasn't verified.",
  "Now, this all comes on the heels of last night's shocking report that showed that Christopher Steele was working closely with Bruce Ohr before and after the 2016 election, again to spread the lies from his dirty dossier.",

  "HANNITY: There's a great irony here, if it wasn't --\n\nGIULIANI: Well, may be if Mueller and his band of whatever they are, Democrats, right, were fair-minded, maybe they'd investigate -- maybe that's the collusion.",
  "GIULIANI: Well, I think of it isn't over by September, then we have a very, very serious violation of the Justice Department rules that you shouldn't be conducting one of these investigations in the 60-day period.",
  "You would need to show that there was a serious crime that you had the president implicated in somehow and that he is the source of evidence that you need to make the case that you can't get from any other source.",
  "HANNITY: So, he tries to get Trump, the American people were fed by him, Hillary paid for it lies because they wanted -- they wanted to influence the American people with Russian lies that she paid for, correct?",
  "Oh, we now know he was also paid by your FBI, your dollars under Jim Comey while they were desperately trying to influence the ongoing counsel with the hunt into so-called Russian collusion and it gets worse.",
  "HANNITY: But the dossier, thinking about the dossier that she paid for and the fact that the FBI paid Steele, it was designed to misinform the American people with Russian lies to influence the election.",
