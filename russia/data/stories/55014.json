  "“The entrance into the Bundestag of the far-right Alternative for Germany party will fundamentally alter German politics,” said professor Stephen Silvia of American University, “because it will shift Germany's political center of gravity significantly to the right and put on the agenda topics that the centrist parties took great pains to avoid, such as immigration, multiculturalism, and the costs as well as the benefits of being in the European Union.”\n\nBut how did we get here?",
  "Those actions may have helped mitigate mainstream anxiety over not only the flood of migrants but also the fears stoked by a terror attack allegedly perpetrated by a Tunisian immigrant in a Berlin Christmas market last December that killed 12 and injured 49, as well as mass sexual assaults carried out in Cologne over New Year’s Eve that affected more than 1,000 women and were apparently carried out, in part at least, by migrants and new arrivals.",
  "In its toddlerhood, the AfD morphed from a party primarily concerned with opposition to the euro and Germany’s role in bailing out failing European economies into a party defined by anti-Muslim rhetoric, xenophobia, anti-migrant positions, pushing for border controls, and, most recently, a bold call to break with Germany’s tradition of accepting total guilt for its past.",
  "She told Newsweek earlier this year, “It’s simply a lie by the government that these migrants will fit into our society.” In the same interview, she also (falsely) blamed refugees for an uptick in criminal activity, told the magazine she was a fan of a closer relationship between Germany and Russia, and argued that it was high time for American troops to leave Germany.",
  "Firing back at her, Gauland said they should school her on German culture and then “dispose of her in Anatolia.”\n\nDuring the campaign for parliament, the AfD became even more aggressive\n\nWhen summer rolled around and the campaign for Germany’s federal elections kicked into high gear, the AfD began running overtly misogynistic and Islamophobic advertisements.",
  "But as xenophobia so often works, Brookings’s Stelzenmüller told me, “There was a direct correlation with lack of actual refugees and votes for AfD.” In other words, regions least effected by the refugee crisis voted more heavily for the AfD, some citing refugees as their reason for doing so and others calling their vote for the AfD a protest vote.",

  "“This is a country which has had whole generations that have learned, more than anyone else, that [far-right, xenophobic parties are] a bad idea.”\n\nThe German education system teaches the Holocaust again and again during the course of a child’s schooling, and Holocaust denial is a crime in the country.",

  "Insults and daily Islamophobia have led to the desecration of houses of worship, and bullying in the streets.”\n\nBut while Petry easily critiqued refugees and Islam, she balked when a local AfD politician began to criticize something else as well: Germany’s policy of remembering the past.",

  "By September 2016, the party was polling around 16 percent in national polls and had edged out Merkel’s Christian Democrats in two regional elections and taken seats in nine out of 16 regional legislatures.",
  "It’s also cannily exploited continued divisions between former East and West Germany, picking up the majority of its supporters from the former German Democratic Republic, as East Germany was once called.",
  "pic.twitter.com/4FKwuUNw79 — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) September 24, 2017\n\nIn its short life, the AfD has also torn through two different sets of leaders, a sign of its own growing pains and uncertainty.",

  "The latest came on Monday with a dramatic, and unexpected, statement by one of the party’s chairs, Frauke Petry, who announced she will serve in parliament as an independent, not for the party.",
