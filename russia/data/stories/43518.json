  "As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares for a showdown with EU lawmakers on Tuesday, the European Data Protection Supervisor expects other breaches to emerge after 87 million users had their Facebook profile scraped and used in targeted political advertising by Cambridge Analytica.",
  "European Data Protection Supervisor\n\nUnder new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force this week, Facebook and other tech companies could be fined up to 4% of their global revenue for privacy breaches.",
  "The European Data Protection Supervisor added that it is important for companies like Facebook to comply with GDPR to restore trust among users — and that May 25, when the law comes into force, is just the starting point.",
  "Buttarelli said Facebook's open relationship with data researchers, which were used to improve and refine the platform according to academics involved, meant that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was no accident.",
  "GDPR must restore user trust\n\nButtarelli said it was difficult to determine whether the Cambridge Analytica breach, which took place in 2015, would have left Facebook vulnerable to a hefty penalty.",
  "Getty\n\nEurope's top data protection official has warned that Facebook's Cambridge Analytica crisis is just the \"tip of an iceberg\" when it comes to scandals involving people's personal information.",
  "\"Whether it's fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people's information, we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibilities,\" Zuckerberg is expected to say.",
  "Buttarelli was referring to the myPersonality test, a University of Cambridge app that was revealed last week to have collected the data of around three million Facebook users.",
  "He said: \"It was not by chance, it was not a data leak, it was not a breach of contract, but actually the result of a standard and later on a predominant business model.\"",
  "I'm not referring to the #deleteFacebook, or the stock exchange effect, but I'm talking about the sense of depression in many users and consumers,\" Buttarelli explained.",
  "Zuckerberg is expected to apologise to European users during his EU Parliament hearing on Tuesday, according to written testimony seen by The New York Times and others.",
  "Trust in Facebook plummeted after the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit in mid-march, but data last week showed that Facebook usage actually increased in April.",
  "You have seen news of other personality tests and also about the 200 apps suspended by Facebook,\" Buttarelli told Business Insider.",

  "His office works with European member states to help them interpret regulation and protect consumers.",
  "Giovanni Buttarelli is responsible for helping enforce data protection laws across the EU.",
  "He said the matter is still being investigated and would depend on a number of factors.",
  "\"I'm afraid that some of them are underestimating the lack of trust among consumers.",
  "\"To apply a fine: Is this a negligence, is this tolerance, is this complicity?",
  "For Facebook, this could mean a fine of more than $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion).",
  "Different conclusions may be raised depending on the period to be analysed.",
  "Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Data Protection Supervisor.",
  "It suggests that the Facebook backlash never fully arrived.",
  "Business Insider has contacted Facebook for comment.",
  "\"Cambridge Analytica is the tip of an iceberg.",
  "It's a retrospective analogy,\" he said.",
  "\"That was a mistake, and I'm sorry.\"",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg."
