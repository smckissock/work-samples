  "But to go back a year later and say this is what should've happened, when the meeting itself was 20 minutes in a series of meetings that took place for days and days and months, I think -- I don't think that's fair to Donald Trump Jr., to Jared Kushner, or to Manafort, for that matter, because no one was in the situation of that kind of campaigning in the middle of a presidential election.",
  "TAPPER: The last time you were on this program back on June 4, you said that it appeared to you that Russian paid Internet trolls created bots, a type of Web robot that performs -- would automatically put forward misinformation, false stories about Hillary Clinton in ways that seemed targeted, targeted, you said, at certain states, certain demographics, certain precincts.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: We now know that there were at least eight people in that meeting, including a Russian-American lobbyist with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, just the latest in what Trey Gowdy, not exactly a leader of the resistance, is calling the drip, drip, drip of information about this controversy.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Those are Republicans on Capitol Hill, objecting to Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last year, and the e-mails and questioning whether the White House can accomplish anything while simultaneously trying to battle against the steady stream of new revelations about Russia.",
  "And campaigns involve opposition research, and the situation exchange that was released by Donald Trump Jr., and what was described there is -- is -- look at it and compare it to, for instance, the situation with the Ukrainians and the DNC and the Clinton campaign, where information actually was shared.",
  "Meanwhile, President Trump is up this morning observing the Sabbath as only he can, tweeting attacks on the free press and on Hillary Clinton, as well as mounting a defense of his son Don Jr., who has acknowledged a meeting with Russians who claimed to want to deliver the Trump campaign dirt on Clinton.",
  "Democrats in Congress are renewing calls to revoke Kushner's security clearance this week, after learning that he attended Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian government lawyer -- that's what it was billed at anyway -- who promised to give the campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton last year.",
  "Overnight, the number one item on President Trump's domestic agenda, repealing and replacing health care, stalled yet again, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announcing just hours ago that the vote will be delayed while Senator John McCain recovers from surgery.",
  "That's determined by what goes on here in Washington, whether anything gets done, whether he tries and it doesn't, but, frankly, if we have a health care bill that doesn't basically undo Obamacare, you know, Senate conservatives fund where I work, we don't want it to pass.",
  "We need to get to the bottom of this but the only way that we're going to do it is to talk not just to Donald Trump Jr., who has offered to cooperate, for which I give him credit, but to everyone who was at that meeting and who was involved in setting up that meeting.",

  "But even more so than that his affluenza and the righteous indignation toward anyone who questions whether or not they knew about Russians tipping the scale towards Donald Trump that is discouraging to the American people and I find it insulting as well.",
  "I would wish that Mitch McConnell would take the advice of my friend Susan Collins, Republican senator from Maine, and let Democrats and Republicans sit down together, the way the Constitution said, and try to work for actually bipartisan solutions.",
  "SELLERS: Well, one of the things that Mitch McConnell is definitely afraid of is postponing this vote any longer which he has to do because of Senator McCain, because Democrats are going to ramp up the resistance, as we so eloquently call it.",
  "And -- in your polling you were talking, I think to Senator Warner about at the beginning of your show or the earlier part of the show where most people think Democrats just stand for being against Trump --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Let's put that poll up.",
  "We do know that there seems to be a convenient pattern, where all of the senior officials of the Trump campaign forget about their meetings with Russians, don't put it on their forms until evidence comes out, and then they have to amend.",
  "Tell them everything about all of these meetings and let's let Mueller do the investigation, the House and Senate, put it behind us and let's -- let's get to the issue at hand, which is the agenda, repealing and replacing Obamacare.",

  "WARNER: I sure want to get to all these questions, because I think, again, not to try to relitigate 2016, but we have got to be ready in 2018, because the one thing we've heard consistently is, the Russians will be back.",
  "We should also ask for all documents, not just the e-mails that have been released but all the documents that are related to any contacts that President Trump's campaign had with the Russian government or its emissaries.",
  "Is that an acknowledgment that the meeting with the Russian lawyer that he thought was with the Russian government was official campaign business, the fact that the Trump campaign paid 50 grand to Trump Jr.'s attorney?",
  "TAPPER: ... expressed disappointment after reading the e-mails from Donald Trump Jr. in which he expressed glee at the prospect of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton from what he thought would be the Russian government.",
  "TAPPER: Isn't it kind of important whether or not what Donald Trump Jr. and Manafort and Kushner did, isn't it also important, whether or not it's legal, whether or not it's wrong, whether or not it's ethical?",

  "It would result in undermining the protections for people with pre-existing conditions and create two separate groups of individuals and some of them would have very skimpy insurance coverage at a low price.",
  "It's a sign that McConnell needs every last vote, given that every Republican senators are rejecting, or wavering, at least, on the bill, including my guest, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who joins us now.",

  "While they're all -- they were looking to clean up voter registration across the country part of that, they will be able to determine information about Russians' influence and impact on the election.",
  "But it will also matter when we turn the corner into 2018, what's his standing with the electorate and -- particularly the primary electorate which is the source of his leverage to have that impact?",
  "You add up all the money they have spent on all these -- all these efforts to disrupt elections, you double it, and you're still talking less than 5 percent of the cost of a new aircraft carrier.",

  "It involved an incident that involved an e-mail campaign and a meeting when he was working, doing work for the campaign, so that to me is not an unusual scenario or an unusual setup at all.",
  "That's what powerful Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren are saying about the threat that a Trump loving, whiskey swilling; rock god might be joining their ranks.",
  "TAPPER: One of the major changes to the health care bill was a provision offered by Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurance companies to sell cheaper plans that offer fewer benefits.",
  "We have lots to discuss with my guest, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, which is, of course, leading the Russia investigation.",
  "TAPPER: So, Ken, let me ask, you agree with Alice -- right -- that getting opposition research from somebody billed as with the Russian government, you wouldn't take that meeting?",
  "Senator John McCain announced he will not be in Washington next week, when the vote was planned, because he is recovering from surgery to remove a blood clot from behind his eye.",
  "But, look, in a situation like this, this is not an unusual situation where the individual that is being questioned, or subject to questioning, Donald Trump Jr., retains counsel.",
  "TAPPER: Are you going to want people from Cambridge Analytica, Brad Parscale, who was part of the -- who led the Trump digital effort, maybe even Facebook executives to testify?",
  "So, I mean, when we're acting like this is some kind of one-off thing that never happens in campaigns, and you just stated the evidence of exactly what took place there, right.",

  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSEKULOW: Yes, and you know -- I thought about that, because you and I talked about that the other day on your weekday broadcast, and I thought about that.",
  "For example, with Mr. Kushner, we now have one, or two, but three examples where he forgot meetings with Russians and has had to go back and amend his disclosure forms.",
  "And this investigation, his -- you know, the continuum of saying no Russia, no collusion to where we are today saying essentially, so what, this is opposition research.",
  "WARNER: Listen, I think -- I'm trying to give all these people the benefit of the doubt until I get a chance to talk to them, until we get a chance to interview them.",
  "TAPPER: Senator, you and Senator Rand Paul, for very different reasons, are opposed to this latest piece of legislation from the Republican leadership in the Senate.",
  "As a member of the House Intelligence Committee how significant, how important are these other people at the meeting besides the three Trump players and the lawyer?",
  "So, the level of credibility from the senior levels of this administration really is suspect, and I think suspect regardless of which political party you belong to.",
  "TAPPER: Congressman we found out there were at least eight people at this meeting, including a Russian American lobbyist with alleged ties to Russian intelligence.",
  "Ken, Charles Krauthammer, who in many ways a very powerful conservative pundit and a leading one, I think it's fair to say, he said that we're in a new phase now.",
  "So...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Because Paul Manafort did work -- because Paul Manafort did work in Ukraine, people in Ukraine wanted the United States to know.",
  "So, I think everybody that's looking backwards and saying would've, should've, could've -- and Donald Trump Jr. said he would've done some things differently.",

  "Does Michigan have enough midnight glancers and topless dancers and cans of freaks and cars packed with speakers and G's with the 40s or chicks with beepers?",
  "We know this was a meeting that was specifically about, in black and white, a part of the Russian government's effort to discredit Clinton and help Trump.",
  "But whatever Mueller does, we should at least accept the facts that Russia attacked us and we have a responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen again.",
  "This is what Charles Krauthammer, conservative columnist, had to say -- quote -- \"The Russia scandal has entered a new phase, and there's no going back.",
  "They paid this a day after one the CNN reporters that was working on the story called to say, what is there -- what can you tell us about this meeting?",
  "[09:05:08]\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of meetings and a lot of discussions about opposition research coming on all sides, Republican, Democrat, and independent.",
  "We want to hear from them and also want to hear from anyone who may have been involved in setting up the meeting or any post meetings that took place.",
  "TAPPER: Who do you think -- there are already two Republicans in opposition, Collins and Rand Paul, if one more comes out against it, then it's dead.",
  "Because the Russians are going to try again, as we know, from their attempts to influence the campaigns in France and in Germany and in Montenegro.",
  "SEKULOW: Well, look, I'm not involved in the discussions with the lawyers on who paid what entity, and I certainly don't represent Donald Trump Jr.",
  "But I represent -- I'm one of the counsel for the President of the United States, who was not involved in the meeting and not aware of the meeting.",
  "SEKULOW: None that I know of, but I represent the president of the United States, but Donald Trump Jr. said not in the context of formal meetings.",
  "It's on a separate track from the special counsel's investigation which is looking at the issue of whether or not there's any criminal wrongdoing.",
  "TAPPER: Do you think Democrats are talking too much about the Russia investigation as opposed to other issues such as health care and tax reform?",
  "I think, if I had a meeting that involved Russian government efforts to try to help candidate Trump and hurt Clinton, that I would remember that.",
  "The central theme of the Republican Party the last eight years, Mitch McConnell said it best, he did -- he wanted it to be a one-term president.",
  "COLLINS: He talked to me at the White House at a meeting of the Republican Caucus a couple of weeks ago, but I have not heard directly from him.",
  "[09:55:00]\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm happy to introduce a son of Detroit, a friend, a guy who makes great music, Kid Rock.",
  "And, frankly, it's a little bit unbelievable that neither the son or the son-in-law ever shared that information with their dad, the candidate.",
  "You heard President Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, a moment ago, the president's lawyer maintaining there is nothing illegal about the meeting.",
  "I don't think that makes the country safer, by not notifying the states that were attacked and not making sure we're better prepared in 2018.",
  "So, the Russians have found, in cyber-warfare, a very good rate of return on what is, frankly, a pittance in terms of money they're spending.",

  "And we need information from the companies, as well as we need to look into the activities of some of the Trump digital campaign activities.",
  "But it certainly has raised enormous -- we've spend -- look, it's Sunday, the end of the week that has covered nothing but Donald Trump Jr.",
  "I think, Republicans and Democrats, I hope -- see this as an opportunity to at least say we have a responsibility to secure the ballot box.",
  "But with regard to Donald Trump Jr. did he say he may have met with other Russian other people, but not in the context of a formal meeting.",
  "DONALD TRUMP JR.: But certainly not in the -- not in the context of actual a formalized meeting or anything like that, because why would I?",
  "But second of all it has distracted, it has thoroughly wiped off the table other meaningful subjects to people's lives like health care.",
  "That would actually help the Republicans, and help the Democrats, and, candidly, it would help the president's approval ratings as well.",
  "SEKULOW: Well, I want to say again that I represent the president, and Donald Trump Jr. said he disclosed everything about the meeting.",
  "But what that means is, the Republicans have to get off this notion that they're going to change all these laws just with Republicans.",
  "He tried to ally any concerns about what this bill will do with Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans and others.",
  "That's why it's so important that we're going to get a chance to question these individuals and try to actually nail down the truth.",
  "And then there would be the group of people who have serious medical problems and their premiums and deductibles would go sky high.",
  "You have said that you're going to vote on the motion to proceed, just to even debate the matter, and as well as the final passage.",
  "Yes, do we take oppo -- everyone at this table is familiar with people coming to you but with opposition research on your opponent?",
  "But it's very bothersome to me that Jared Kushner has forgotten not once, not twice, but three times to put down this information.",
  "TAPPER: Breaking news: What happened overnight that is forcing a major delay on Republican plans to repeal and replace Obamacare?",
  "And, Jake, what bothers me is, because the president won't acknowledge this attack, we don't have a whole government response.",
  "I would look at Kasich and I would look at Sandoval, because they have a great deal of influence over Portman and over Heller.",
  "But I think it's really important that we get documents from these individuals first, so we can ask them the right questions.",
  "Wouldn't the Cruz provision, however, make it possible for some people who can't afford to buy coverage able to buy coverage?",
  "TAPPER: You're also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is of course investigating the Russia investigation.",
  "But we do need to make sure we know the answers to Russian interference in the campaign whether there was any collaboration.",
  "You can't take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program and not think that it's going to have some kind of effect.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: If it fails to pass, do you think President Trump might go after some of his fellow Republicans?",
  "The distraction has affected our ability to work for those people especially his ability to deliver on the promises he made.",
  "President Trump and I believe the Senate health care bill strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSELLERS: And now we are against repeal and replace or whatever that may be and we are against Donald Trump.",
  "You know, I don't hear the outrage from my Republican colleagues that I believe that this Russia investigation deserves.",
  "So, from our perspective, my answer stands, and that is that the president was not engaged in this, was not aware of it.",
  "And most of all we need to put into place safeguards to prevent this kind of interference from happening in the future.",
  "End of the day, we have got to get the information, and then we have to share the information with the American public.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSEKULOW: But I -- look, I don't know the final, final determination of who's paying what bills to whom.",
  "TAPPER: And he popped up recently next to President Trump at a White House visit with pals Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent.",
  "But those people that our committee has jurisdiction over, the Americans, I sure as heck want to talk to all of them.",
  "TAPPER: I'm waiting with my pen to sign it, says the president, pressuring Republicans to pass this health care bill.",
  "But that's why we need go through the normal committee process and get input from people on both sides of the aisle.",
  "COLLINS: I do want to see more flexibility in the insurance market\n\n\n\nbut Senator Cruz's approach is not the answer.",
  "There is a way to deal with this and that is by creating a reinsurance pool for people with pre-existing conditions.",
  "Are you willing to acknowledge that, regardless of the legality here, this was wrong and a violation of civic honor?",
  "REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, plain and simple.",
  "[09:15:00]\n\n\n\nWhat is your response to this argument that there is nothing criminal here at this meeting last year?",
  "The president -- and this has been incontrovertible -- was not aware of the meeting and did not attend the meeting.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I don't...\n\n\n\nSEKULOW: He was running -- but, Jake, he was running the campaign at the time.",
  "WARNER: Listen, I think we need to try to work with our Republican colleagues on tax reform, on health care reform.",
  "Do you think that the bill will pass or do you think there are enough other wavering Republicans that it will not?",
  "But we don't see that same outrage because it's Donald Trump and he's able to meander his way in and out of lives.",
  "TAPPER: That June 2016 meeting with that Russian lawyer, CNN has confirmed that it included at least eight people.",
  "REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: This drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration.",
  "Republicans, as you know, can only -- can't afford to lose any more votes from the Republican conference on this.",
  "It will be interesting to see, though, whether they will be willing to testify in open hearing or closed hearing.",
  "TAPPER: Do you have any sort of timeline on when we're going to have testimony from Kushner and Donald Trump Jr.?",
  "Let me just quickly say that all of us are concerned about John McCain, and we're wishing him a speedy recovery.",
  "We should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that's been on the books for 50 years.",
  "He said he may have met with Russian people, as a lot of people meet with Russian people, so that's not unusual.",
  "TAPPER: There isn't one because nobody from the Ukrainian government met with anybody from the Clinton campaign.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP JR., SON OF DONALD TRUMP: I have probably met with other people from Russia.",
  "TAPPER: Do you think that Trump Jr. and Kushner will testify in open session, so the public can hear from them?",
  "That would affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, including disabled children, poor seniors.",
  "And so, I think the Democrats can talk about the 23 million people that are going to be kicked off health care.",
  "We did it in Maine for 18 months before the Affordable Care Act went into effect and it was highly successful.",

  "We had -- we were delayed a bit by the firing of Jim Comey, which, again, nobody could have been predicted.",
  "The Medicaid program, without having a single hearing to evaluating what the consequences are going to be.",
  "TAPPER: President Trump tries to defend his son's meeting with Russians, even as the story keeps changing.",
  "So, I'm not sure why we would take anybody in the senior level of the Trump administration at their word.",
  "And it's one reason why the intelligence committee's counterintelligence investigation needs to continue.",
