  "I think it's important is this story was generated by Steve Bannon working under the auspices of the Mercer family, the right-wing billionaires who produced the book \"Clinton Cash\" which in return before it was published was given to \"New York Times' reporters who took this, realized there really is a story here and it generated a front page story in \"The New York Times\" above the fold just after Clinton announced her candidacy.",
  "And I think the message that sort of disturbing is, if you're independent minded and willing to take your own position on particular issue and try to reach out and solve problems, that can cost you your seat politically, and that's a dangerous place for us to be in because we got to have people who are willing to reach across the aisle, who are willing to try to find solutions.",
  "But this comes after 24 hours of the president fending off attacks from members of his own party, including Senator Jeff Flake who got on the Senate floor immediately after that lunch was over and delivered this pretty blistering 20-minute critique of the president, and that was just hours after Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said the president was debasing the nation.",
  "It was all talked about before, but the Hill newspaper, which report on a lot of things was the government here, came out with report showing the FBI was investigating a subsidiary or Rosatom for possible racketeering money laundering, bribes, all aimed at giving the Russian government more influence over the U.S. nuclear industry while this deal was being approved.",
  "An item reported at the end of the last hour concerning the congressman's conspiracy theory about the white supremacist rally that turn deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, talking about the rally organizer, Jason Kessler, I misspoke saying, \"He originally voted for President Trump, in fact, he says he voted for President Obama and attended one occupy event.\"",
  "And other thing it tells me is, that there's -- this rather blatant inconsistency and hypocrisy going on by people who want to be outraged by this connection between the Clinton campaign and this dossier and yet do not want there to be an investigation of the Trump campaign, the president of the United States currently, and the collusion with Russia.",
  "The purpose of the story as Bannon tells me in the book was to impugn Clinton's character, which it did, and what's interesting is it's coming up now at the very point at which Russia has become a problem for Donald Trump and by Congressional Republicans surfacing this now, I think it muddies the water and draws attention away from Trump.",
  "COOPER: From your vantage point, I'm wondering what the impact do you think of Senator Flake and Senator Corker's actions yesterday have on Capitol Hill, I mean, do you colleague think it's beginning any kind of a shift away from the president or is that simply just something that, that people were not running again might be able to do.",
  "But it speaks volumes that if Bannon is CEO of the campaign, and they decided to go with the RNC data operation and not this psycho whatever crap that Cambridge is trying to sell that's ridiculously ineffective and not actually accurate, once they found that out, you have a lot of campaign novices working on the Trump campaign.",

  "And so, it's a minimal role when you have this massive data operation at the RNC run, and a company that wants to sell themselves, which is convenient for the press to then --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: -- you're saying they were paid $5 million to $10 million and that they had employees there, which is what Josh has said.",
  "So if it's unity in the Republican Party really largely depends on who you are asking at this point, because we're seeing a lot of senators trying to stick by the president overall, Republican senators, because they're very desperate for a legislative accomplishment here and all eyes are on tax reform at the moment.",
  "In addition to that, Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law who headed up one of his data operations and is now senior adviser said to \"Forbes\" magazine back in November that just after the president won the election he said, \"We kept both data operations going simultaneously and a lot shared between them.",
  "So this was also part -- we're thinking of it in today's world, right, where we're looking at Russia as someone who tried to interfere with our election, who has basically become a major, you know, enemy of the United States and at that point they were trying have a relationship with them.",
  "According to the reporting, that research initially has been funded by, as of yet, unknown anti-Trump Republican source, a source familiar with the matter tell CNN that Hillary Clinton was not aware of Christopher Steele's dossier until \"BuzzFeed\" published the document earlier this year.",
  "MARTIN: -- right, so one of my point is that, that's a great -- the point these guys are all to Mike's point, they have consultants that are doing all sort of things and selling and advertising them, if they were the ones that made the difference, whether it's true or not doesn't matter.",
  "By law, even though Uranium One was a Canadian firm, the U.S. part of this deal had to be approved by the committee on foreign investment in the U.S. which has comprised of nine agencies including the State Department, and at that time, Hillary Clinton was the boss there, Anderson.",

  "SHIELDS: There's one part, there's a lot of things I would disagree with Paul, but there's one that I would really disagree that I think you will maybe admit, just because a campaign spends $5 million on, it doesn't mean they think it's great or it's well-spent money.",

  "The president was asked after he had been criticizing Jeff flake on the South Lawn as he was departing for Texas if he feels like he should be more civil and he said that it's the press that portrays him as an uncivil person and he cited his Ivy League education.",
  "The head of this firm, Alexander Nix sent an e-mail to several people including top Republican Donor, Rebecca Rebekah Mercer, relaying that he had, in fact, reached out to Assange, but sources say no one from the actual Trump campaign was on that e-mail chain.",
  "The issue is tone and what he is doing to the country, the division, the hostility, the dog whistles to the races and the discrimination that's going on, the legitimizing of people that think they are better than others, that's what's bothering Republicans.",
  "Now for contacts, Anderson, WikiLeaks which is responsible for releasing hacked e-mails from the DNC and Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta's e-mails last year, but not Hillary Clinton's e-mails, and we don't even know if a third party ever obtained.",

  "Then, as Pamela pointed out in her report on July 27th Donald Trump gives his last press conference of the campaign where he asks for WikiLeaks or for Russia rather to hack Hillary Clinton, which, in fact, they were doing and they did.",
  "The contrast is, the Trump campaign met with Russian lobbyists and lawyers being told before the meeting we have dirt from the crown prosecutor of the Kremlin on your opponent, and Mr. Trump Jr. said, if that's what it is, I love it.",
  "Because tonight we're taking you to a quaint little cafe in, Long Beach, California called Sweet Dixie Kitchen, purveyor (ph) of Southern comfort food, Mac and Cheese, grits, that kind of stuff, the kind of food I personally love.",
  "She delegated it sensible to somebody who knows more about this stuff, again, in Jose Fernandez, who is the assistant secretary who said, and I'm quoting, he said, \"Hillary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.\"",
  "I don't know how involved they were in Cambridge, but clearly Cambridge was an important part of the Trump campaign --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: -- and they've also been on the record in the \"New York Times\" about this before.",
  "MARTIN: But now we have Paul's phrase earlier, an agent of the DNC and the Clinton campaign using a British spy who we're going to find out paying Russian sources in contact with the Russians to try to come up with a dossier.",
  "If that's the case, Hillary Clinton's campaign was the best-run campaign we've ever seen --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBEGALA: -- if they were paid that $5 million, but they weren't really doing data analytics, what were they doing?",

  "Also in the wake of stinging (ph) public criticism from four big name Republicans including Former President George W. Bush, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee and both GOP senators from Arizona.",
  "But I think -- I'm reporting now to a reporter, as an outsider, not a member of the Republican caucus, I think there is consensus in the Republican caucus, they want to move forward on that particular agenda item.",
  "What we have now confirmed is that there are political consultants whether law firms, Perkins Coie, whatever, Cambridge Analytica, that go out and act wildly and go out and contact Julian Assange and Russians.",
  "COOPER: Does the story that broke yesterday at the \"Washington Post\" about the DNC and the Clinton campaign paying for some of the opposition research that was in that dossier, does that change things at all?",
  "This all comes after the House and Senate passing the sanctions against Russia nearly unanimously back in August in retaliation for meddling in the U.S. election and President Trump signed the bill into law.",
  "There's an investigation, there's been literally zero evidence whatsoever that there's collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and yet people will come on air and just say it as if it's fact.",
  "A gentleman named -- like a little salt, a gentleman named Alvin Copeland Sr. opened the Popeyes in 1972 with the original name \"Chicken on the run\", which is an objectively terrible name for a restaurant.",

  "POWERS: And he suggested that it was some semantics that the Clinton campaign --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right, the lawyer --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: The lawyer was basically saying, well, it wasn't a dossier yet.",
  "So we've learn that just after Trump won the nomination his campaign started the series of payments to Cambridge Analytica in July all the way through mid December, totaling just about $6 million.",
  "NAVARRO: And the interesting thing is, you know, a lot of the criticism that's coming from Corker, that's coming from (INAUDIBLE), that's coming from Flake, these guys actually vote with Trump.",

  "After several months of lackluster performance, as you might imagine, that restaurant reopened as Popeyes named after Detective Jimmy Popeye Doyle from the movie, \"The French Connection\".",
  "MIKE SHIELDS, CNN POLITICALCOMMENTATOR: Yes, and actually I just -- from what I understand from talking to people involved with the campaign, what you just said is actually not accurate.",
  "And so, as you'll see from the statement, not only are they sort of distancing themselves from Cambridge Analytica, but also not denying that this e- mail reach out did actually happen.",
  "I should mention that Brad Parscale who is also -- who over saw that the data analytics operation, he did tell \"60 Minutes\" recently that Cambridge Analytica did not play a huge role.",
  "What made it a viable story, what it doesn't show was there was any kind of collusion --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBEGALA: -- Politifact, which has done a really good explanation at this one.",

  "And, look, and I think a lot of the people that are standing behind him also probably have some problems with him, but ultimately are voting, you know, the way he wants them to vote.",
  "But I can tell you my understanding, which is pretty knowledgeable understanding of the inner workings of the RNC, was that the RNC did run the data operation for the Trump Campaign.",
  "But on the Hillary Clinton story, I'm assuming you're going to be saying that the lawyer who was hired, you know, is not the campaign and therefore may have done stuff on their own.",
  "It's 13.3 million votes, that's a ton of votes, but it's still 45 percent, 55 percent of Republicans who voted in those primaries and Caucus voted for somebody other than Mr. Trump.",
  "We've also seen Senator John McCain criticize the president in recent days and Former President George W. Bush who was pretty much silent during the Barack Obama years in office.",
  "His attorney tells us at CNN this man has a lot of information about corruption surrounding this matter, and he says the informant was stunned when the uranium deal was approved.",
  "Also on the menu, chicken and waffles and that's where the trouble starts because recently a customer at Sweet Dixie Kitchen saw boxes of Popeyes being carried into the kitchen.",
  "[21:30:07] And I think, you know, yes, he's had some very high-profile problems with a couple senators this week, but overall he really has a problem with a handful of people.",
  "One is, that the Clinton campaign was run by people who had -- you know, seasoned political veterans, they knew enough not to be making the direct calls to Assange themselves.",
  "A key question for Congressional investigators, did Hillary Clinton give 20 percent of the United States supply of uranium to Russia for donations to the Clinton Foundation?",

  "So, of course, his opponents both in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are going to want to know what's he's been doing in these international business deals.",
  "Hillary has got to deny that she knew that they did it, but we know that the Perkins Coie paid big money, $12 million --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: And we're going to get to that story.",
  "And that so -- this is kind of a --\n\n\n\nPAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, you don't pay a firm like that, I think it's $5.9 as Pamela reported, $5.9 million.",

  "COOPER: The White House is pointing to finger at the State Department saying the sanctions are undergoing what they call interagency review and will be announced soon.",
  "When we come back the Trump administration more than three weeks passed the deadline to impose new sanction on top Russians involved in meddling of the U.S. election.",
  "So the idea that the Trump campaign was using Cambridge is a fallacy that the Cambridge executives want everyone to believe because they're not selling their company.",
  "And it also went on to say, \"We as a campaign made the choice to rely on the voter data of the Republican National Committee to help elect President Donald J. Trump.",
  "They got back apparently this very salacious and now infamous dossier, which they never used, in fact, didn't even reach the press until after the election was over.",
  "That being said, you now have the (INAUDIBLE) head, the symbolic head of the Republican Party who spends an enormous amount of time beating up on other Republicans.",
  "That all happened under the Obama administration with Hillary Clinton as the secretary of state while --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: It was approved by multiple government agencies.",
  "POWERS: Well, the other thing that I think is important to remember is that this happened at a time when -- it was the -- they were trying to do the Russia reset.",
  "And so the e-mail reach out happened around that time and then-candidate Trump was on the campaign trail repeatedly referencing Clinton's 33,000 missing e-mails.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.",
  "You know, and the Republicans I talked to privately, I mean, the only place I really see unity is in their desire for Trump to stop tweeting and attacking them.",
  "I don't know whether it's 52 vote unity or whether it's 50 or 49, I mean, that's remains to be seen, because we don't really know what the plan is going to be.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMARTIN: Now we know that President Clinton's campaign, the agent of campaign went and worked with the Russians to try to sabotage the election.",
  "One thing I point out, the guy that made those donations, he made them 18 months before Hillary was even secretary of state and three years before this deal.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think the uranium sale to Russia and the way it was done, so underhanded with tremendous amounts of money being passed.",
  "COOPER: The president says his visit to Capitol Hill was a lovefest, those are the words he used, and that there's great unity within the Republican Party.",
  "I mean, the idea this is some rogue group of people that aren't somehow connected at least to people who are completely dedicated to electing Donald Trump.",
  "And I think of all the things we've talked about, this has more teeth and more legs than -- and that was a great explanation by CNN there of what this is.",
  "BEGALA: OK.\n\n\n\nGREEN: Mrs. Clinton did wrong was she didn't disclose the donors -- the head of this company was donating money to the Clinton Foundation.",
  "KING: Well, one of the problems is, at the State Department, there's literally nobody at the top echelon and this isn't because of any delay at Congress.",
  "And it flows out of the sale in 2010 of this company, Uranium One, which controlled about a fifth of America's uranium to a Russian firm called Rosatom.",
  "I know them both, Jeff Flake came in with me five years ago and, of course, Bob Corker has been here for, I think, this would have been his third term.",
  "And the second thing that's true is the FBI, the story the Hill wrote --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMARTIN: They're not carrying water for the Trump campaign.",

  "First of all, the Russians clearly tried to get involved in our election and they're an enemy of America we need to do something about that.",
  "I mean, my understanding has been right along that the original work, the original investment, if you will, was made on the Republican side.",
  "But there is something wrong with reaching out to WikiLeaks, I believe, which was in possession of stolen material that the Russians hacked.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMARTIN: -- it's not what you all said that we should look into whether the president has done anything to influence the FBI.",
  "Secretary Tillerson is about it, other than that there's nobody running any of the departments and divisions over at the State Department.",
  "[21:10:05] And I also think sort of -- to what Josh is saying, they don't have to have been the biggest operation or the most influential.",
  "Look, I don't think that there's anything wrong with hiring somebody to do oppo research whether that person is a British citizen or not.",
  "So, the idea that Donald Trump came to Washington and suddenly the party started fracturing I think is really not the correct narrative.",

  "I mean, even the name Popeyes is derivative unless the actual sailor man built the company from the ground up with his own two biceps.",
