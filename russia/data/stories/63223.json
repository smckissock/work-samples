  "In July 2009, Pagliano took a course entitled “How to be a Contracting Office.” Two months later he sat for sessions entitled “Managing State Projects” and “Information Assurance.”\n\nPagliano’s superiors in the IT department have said they were not aware that he was moonlighting as Clinton’s private email system administrator.",
  "A copy of Pagliano’s State Department employee profile obtained by The Daily Caller through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit (which is being handled by the watchdog group Cause of Action) shows that he received some in-service training which was geared more to managerial aspects of IT rather than technical areas.",

  "The IT director on Clinton’s 2008 campaign, Pagliano was hired as a Schedule C employee by the State Department in May 2009, much to the confusion of the agency’s career IT officials, who had never had a political appointee work in their shop.",
  "Pagliano’s hire, despite his thin resume, “demonstrates his political connections more than qualifications that folks would typically want for a sensitive position like that,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told The Daily Caller.",

  "Bryan Pagliano’s resume, which the State Department recently turned over to Judicial Watch, shows he had neither experience nor certification in protecting email systems against cyber security threats.",
  "But experts have said it is possible that Clinton’s system was infiltrated in other ways besides a traditional hack or by sophisticated foreign government operatives who could cover their tracks.",
  "According to The Post:\n\nThe server was nothing remarkable, the kind of system often used by small businesses, according to people familiar with its configuration at the end of her tenure.",
  "Without encryption – a process that scrambles communication for anyone without the correct key – email, attachments and passwords are transmitted in plain text,” The Post reported.",
  "Questions have swirled around the security of Clinton’s email system, which utilized her personal non-government BlackBerry and the server, which was kept at her house in New York.",
  "Newly released documents are raising more questions about whether the State Department IT specialist who managed Hillary Clinton’s private email system was qualified for the job.",
  "His resume shows he had only basic computer networking certifications, and none that would have provided the foundation for protecting a sensitive email system like Clinton’s.",
  "“For data of the sensitivity…we would need at a minimum a small team to do monitoring and hardening,” said Jason Fossen, a cyber security specialist with the SANS Institute.",
  "The Democratic presidential front-runner has insisted that there is no evidence that the server was hacked, and the FBI has reportedly not found evidence of a hack.",
  "The CEO of one security consulting firm that handles all manner of security threats for the federal governments, private companies and heads of state concurs.",
  "The Romanian hacker Guccifer recently claimed that he infiltrated Clinton’s server after breaking into her friend Sidney Blumenthal’s AOL account in 2013.",
  "An analysis conducted by the cyber security firm Venafi Inc. found that it was without standard encryption during its first two months of existence.",
  "His training after taking the job at the State Department also appears to be devoid of any in-depth information security or cyber security courses.",
  "In addition to certifications in MSCE NT and 2000, CCNA, A+, and CCA, Pagliano had a political science degree from Emory University.",
  "The Washington Post provided details of the system in a report earlier this year showing that the setup was relatively primitive.",
  "His official job duties are still unknown, but while he performed them he was also in charge of managing Clinton’s email system.",
  "The system was also accessible via a login page on the World Wide Web, a configuration that added additional vulnerability.",
  "His first training session was an “Ethics Orientation for New Employees” course which he took just after starting his job.",
