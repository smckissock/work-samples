  "Also present were Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin; Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian lobbyist and former Soviet military intelligence officer; Anatoli Samachornov, a translator; and Rob Goldstone, the British music publicist who arranged the meeting at the request of Aras and Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian family.",
  "The ongoing investigation into whether President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election gained new traction on Monday when The Washington Post reported that a foreign-policy adviser, George Papadopolous, sent at least six emails during the campaign offering to set up meetings with Russian leaders.",
  "His requests were reportedly met with hesitancy from multiple campaign officials, including retired Navy Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, who voiced concerns about violating both US sanctions on Russia and the Logan Act, a law forbidding US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without authorization.",
  "Trump Putin More\n\nThe legal issues 'are very similar, if not the same'\n\nWhat may account for Manafort's rejection of one meeting and acceptance of the other is that Papadopoulos' was \"pitched as a Trump-level meeting,\" said Andrew Wright, an associate professor at Savannah Law School.",
  "Mariotti wrote in a series of tweets that perhaps the most important implication of the news was that \"everyone on those emails was aware of the concerns expressed in the emails about meeting with Russians, including Admiral Kubic's concern about the legality of meeting with Russia.\"",
  "Papadopoulos followed up on May 4, sending Lewandowski and Sam Clovis, the campaign cochairman, a message he'd received from Ivan Timofeev, a senior official at the Russian International Affairs Council, that Russian officials were open to Trump visiting Moscow.",
  "\"If anyone on those emails later met with Russians or accepted aid from them,\" Mariotti continued, \"the prior emails about concerns could be used to indicate that they knew that the meeting was problematic and potentially illegal but nonetheless persisted.\"",
  "Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman and a current subject in the Russia investigation, also expressed concerns about the proposal and rejected Papadopoulos' request for a meeting between Trump and Russian officials in May 2016, according to The Post.",
  "In one email in April 2016 to Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager at the time, Papadopoulos said he had gotten \"a lot of calls over the past month\" about how \"Putin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right,\" according to The Post.",
  "Manafort's rejection stands in contrast to his willingness to accept a meeting with a Russian lawyer weeks later in June, a point that Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, raised after the story broke.",
  "Newly reported emails show a campaign foreign-policy adviser's efforts to set up a meeting between Donald Trump, then a candidate, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "Papadopolous sent the first email to seven campaign advisers in March 2016 with the subject line \"Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including Putin.\"",
  "\"Russia has been eager to meet with Mr. Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss,\" Papadopoulos said, according to The Post.",
  "Manafort forwarded the email to an associate and said, \"We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips,\" The Post reported.",
  "They then agreed to have someone else handle the response, indicating that it did not require a reply from a senior official like Manafort.",
  "Clovis replied, \"There are legal issues we need to mitigate, meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen,\" according to the report.",
  "The meeting Manafort attended in June included Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.",
  "Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, expressed concern about the proposal and rejected the request.",
  "Papadopoulos forwarded the message to Manafort right after he was named Trump's campaign chairman.",
  "Experts say the emails could pose a \"devastating\" legal entanglement for Manafort.",
