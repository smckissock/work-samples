  "(Tori Ferenc for The Washington Post)\n\nBanks spoke with The Washington Post twice this week, once at his insurance company headquarters, which even Banks says looks like the stage set for Ricky Gervais’s British mockumentary “The Office,” and once at Old Down, a sprawling hilltop estate with giant rabbits, wandering llamas and views all the way to Wales that Banks rents out for weddings and seminars for pensioners on “wealth management.” He lives in a much smaller farmhouse down the road.",
  ".”\n\nThe book’s ghost writer, British political journalist Isabel Oakeshott (whose emails were the ones that went missing), concluded that Banks and Wigmore “were shamelessly used by the Russians” in a “classic Russian fishing expedition.”\n\n\n\nArron Banks, right, a co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign, and Andy Wigmore, left, a political operative, pose for a portrait at Old Down Estate in Bristol, England.",

  "Clearly, there’s a lot more to it.”\n\nCollins, who has been investigating the Kremlin’s political interference for thepast two years, said the Russian style is to reach out to fellow travelers with shared worldviews — they see a person who is disrupter and try to help that person along.",

  "The 52-year-old millionaire insurance mogul — with a passion for off-road car rallies around Kenya, endless gin and tonics, and Brexit politician Nigel Farage — was the main bankroller of the renegade 2016 campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.",
  "“Our politicians are struggling to come to grips with it, but is that any surprise?”\n\nBanks’s book, written in the aftermath of the historic vote, is a loose diary — a self-serving, funny, self-depreciating, humble-bragging insider’s account.",
