  "GOODLATTE: Well, certainly, this is a big development for the investigation that I, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Trey Gowdy, as chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have been pursuing now for the last nine months, because, as you know, at each step in that process, the FBI has objected to our looking into this matter, because they claim it's part of an ongoing investigation.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: The president sees the Mueller investigation, he sees all these accusations from partisan Democrats, Hillary Clinton, saying, oh, he colluded with the Russians, but then he also sees that the only people who actually we know colluded with the Russians were Hillary Clinton, who paid a British agent, who then paid Russians for information with this dossier.",
  "GOODLATTE: In one instance doing everything possible to avoid indicting Hillary Clinton, including allowing her chief aides to be in the room with her when she was interviewed by the FBI, creating a memo exonerating her before most of the witnesses, including Secretary Clinton, had been interviewed, not putting this before a grand jury, even though they had impaneled a grand jury in that investigation.",
  "BARTIROMO: I want to run for you what Senator Rand Paul said on Fox News this past week, because I'm wondering if this information and all that we're gleaning from all of this, whether it's the FISA warrant or your interactions with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, which I'm going to get to, if that is going to dictate where the Robert Mueller investigation goes.",
  "This is an extremely disturbing thing to see both he and James Comey, supposedly impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important areas in intelligence-gathering and law enforcement, express the kind of extreme bias that they have shown now, which I think reflects quite accurately on what they were doing back in 2016.",
  "And they put together all of Natalia Veselnitskaya's talking points about me for the Trump Tower meeting where she went into speak with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAnd I would deduce that Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson, therefore, put together the same talking points for Vladimir Putin, because they were the same talking points in Trump Tower.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, we certainly learned that there is a serious problem with the FBI presenting to the FISA court an application for a search warrant against a United States citizen and then followed by three renewals when they were basing it on a very flawed document, the so-called Steele dossier, that has never been verified.",
  "But I will also say that she reminded us of some documents that hadn't been talked about for a while, including the fact that there are not only memos by James Comey that we're all aware of, but also memos by Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, that are of interest to us as well, and we're seeking those now.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country and they will be present for this questioning.",
  "So when you have between the two bills 224 Republicans voting yes to build a wall, secure the border, solve the DACA problem and the visa lottery system, and not one Democrat could find a way to vote for any of those bills, it shows you they don't want to solve this problem and we do.",
  "And top of the news right now, the Justice Department is making its first public disclosure of a highly sensitive FISA request by releasing the heavily redacted version of the documents relating to that FISA warrant against former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.",
  "But I can very heartily agree with Senator Paul when he says that Democratic operatives related to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the creation of the so-called Steele dossier, and then turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
  "I think that's an important question that he needs to answer, but I also think it's even more important that he continue to work with the Congress to move this forward, so that we can get answers to all of our questions and get all of the documents that we have subpoenaed.",
  "And, equally as important, their party is getting so far to the left, that if Republicans, who have a lot of open seats and a lot of challenged seats, if they go out and talk about the president's programs of getting the economy moving, what have you, they will do fine.",
  "That's why right from day one I called for an independent, nonpartisan, expert investigating commission that would look at the entire 2016 election, ranging from Comey's statements to Strzok to whether the Obama administration put a spy in the campaign.",
  "But I can say that, based upon our other aspects of this investigation, that Peter Strzok was at the heart of both the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation, where the FBI bent over backwards to find every way possible to not proceed with that case.",
  "And, by the way, those few key people are the same people in both of these investigations, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, the FBI counsel, the chief of staff to the director, the same people in both these investigations.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, we held a hearing last week with representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, in the case of Google, particularly YouTube, regarding their censorship policies, which they do on all three of those social media platforms.",

  "BARTIROMO: And many of the people that you mentioned, they have signed -- on the signage page of this FISA warrant, they all signed it, OKing it, and that includes John Brennan -- Sally Yates, John Brennan, Jim Comey, Peter Strzok.",
  "GOODLATTE: And we have had the opportunity to ask some very probing questions about how it is that they have liability protections that newspaper or television...\n\nBARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman, we're going to be looking at this.",
  "BARTIROMO: Now, the charges that he levels against you, which were all debunked, we should say, but he says you avoided taxes in Russia and in the U.S. and that you gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton.",
  "But what's so unprecedented about this is that the FBI then took it, weaponized it, without ever verifying its credibility, and brought it to the FISA court without disclosing the source of that information.",
  "BARTIROMO: And in a -- also foreign policy, you look at some of the outcomes that have come, Jim Mattis apparently saying that the NATO meeting was among the most successful meetings that he's ever seen.",
  "The president later tweeted this: \"Looking more and more like the Trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon, surveillance for the political gain of crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC.",
  "The very people who keep our country safe -- ICE has been directly responsible for stopping human trafficking, stopping -- saving some of these kids that are being exploited from human trafficking.",
  "FREEMAN: No, why do they continue to say that Steele is credible after they even acknowledge in their re-applications that he didn't do as he was told and he was sharing information with the media?",
  "Two years later, we're asked to believe that this was some secret Russian plot to revive the American economy and rebuild the U.S. military and strengthen Ukraine to resist Russian expansionism.",
  "BROWDER: And, since then, I have put aside everything else I'm doing on a mission to get justice for Sergei Magnitsky, which has resulted in the Magnitsky Act, which Putin hates me so much for.",
  "There has been definitely more cooperation since we issued the subpoena and since U.S. attorney John Lausch from the Northern District of Illinois was appointed to help us get those documents.",
  "We get the GDP number out on Thursday, and all expectations call for a second-quarter GDP number of 4 percent, largely as a result of some of the rollback in regulations and the tax cut plan.",
  "President Trump responds this morning to the Justice Department releasing more than 400 pages of documents related to the 2016 FISA application for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.",
  "Number two, I have had the opportunity, as have a few other members of the House of Representatives, the opportunity to read these FISA warrant applications without all of those redactions.",
  "And I think the fact that a judge has now ordered the release of this FISA warrant application shows that it is entirely appropriate for us to look into how this investigation was launched.",
  "What happens now when you're -- in your estimation, based on what we know from Peter Strzok, what we know about the hearings in terms of Lisa Page, and, of course, all of these texts?",
  "Your thoughts on the president's relationship with Vladimir Putin and what the U.S. needs to do with Russia, given these horrible stories we just heard about Putin from Bill Browder.",
  "These particular charges have been analyzed by the U.S. Department of Justice, by the British government, by Interpol, by the German government, and have all been rejected outright.",
  "I know that you have been focused and certainly your colleague Devin Nunes has been focused on any information before the actual investigation was launched, which was July 31, 2016.",
  "And, by the way, what does that say about Comey, McCabe, Yates, Rosenstein, and the others who repeatedly certified to the court that he was, that he was an agent of foreign power?",
  "He was then arrested by some of the people he exposed, put in pretrial detention, tortured for 358 days, and then killed at the age of 37 in a Russian prison on November 16, 2009.",
  "And when they weren't relying on the dossier, they were appealing to the authority of Yahoo News, without pointing out that that was a Steele story as well in terms of the source.",
  "This is an ongoing investigation, and there are many more documents and many more questions that witnesses have been instructed by the FBI not to answer that need to be answered.",
  "And a quick programming note: Former Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joe Lieberman will join me this Wednesday on \"Mornings With Maria\" on the Fox Business Network.",
  "BARTIROMO: I want to know what this tells us about the Robert Mueller probe, because you go back to Carter Page, and here is the guy who was actually wiretapped and surveilled.",
  "BARTIROMO: Well, what strikes me about all of these documents that I have been looking at all morning is all of the redactions on every page, major black, black lines redacted.",
  "The president reacting on Twitter earlier this morning, saying: \"Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents.",
  "And, Mr. Chairman, we know, based on the copies of the FISA warrant that we were able to look at today, that Rod Rosenstein, the deputy A.G., signed off on the FISA warrant.",
  "He was down at the White House just a few days ago working with President Trump to make sure that the cuts include all the things we want to do to keep this economy growing.",
  "Are you going to be able to come up with a plan that protects the DACA recipients, but also protects this country with the proper security in terms of securing the borders?",

  "We don't want to see the thumb of any FBI agents, Justice Department officials, Russia, Comey, we don't want to see the come, even a pinkie on the scale of our election.",
  "And it is a part of the reason why the new FBI director has been hard at work trying to reform this organization, whose credibility has been damaged by a few key people.",
  "Page, in contrast to Mr. Strzok, was far more forthcoming and gave us far more information regarding what was going on in 2016 and into 2017, to help our investigation.",
  "GOODLATTE: And there are many members hard at work trying to make sure that we bring some of the measures from the second one into the first one and get over 218 votes.",
  "He's obsessed because I was the one responsible for getting the Magnitsky Act passed in 2012, which sanctions Putin and his corrupt cronies for human rights violations.",
  "And I think you should have an objective, neutral person go through the redactions and always err in favor of publicly releasing and transparency, rather than secrecy.",
  "Some of the great things President Trump has done, working with us to cut taxes, to get the economy moving, to bring regulations under control, it's actually working.",
  "We have already seen Judge Ellis in Virginia question the special counsel, wonder whether, not only are they trying to make people sing, but also make them compose.",
  "And what is the strategy for House Republicans to keep control of the House, as we witness a rising interest in Democratic socialism ahead of the midterm elections?",
  "They didn't let the grand jury determine whether she should be indicted, and then changing the language in the memo from gross negligence to extreme carelessness.",
  "BROWDER: Well, so after exposing corruption in these big companies like Gazprom, Putin expelled me from the country, declared me as a threat to national security.",
  "And the more the American people know about it, the more distressed they are at how special counsels operate, particularly in the context of political elections.",
  "BROWDER: Well, basically, even if there's only a 1 percent chance of it happening, if I get handed over to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin, I will be killed.",
  "But we do want to see how this investigation was launched and how it contrasts with the shocking way that they handled the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.",
  "BARTIROMO: So, tell us about that, because just to briefly go through your story, at one point, you were the leading -- one of the leading investors in Russia.",
  "And the question really is, was there other information sufficient beyond the Steele dossier to justify intruding on the privacy rights of an American citizen?",
  "But the Congress, which has subpoena power and has issued subpoenas with regard to both documents and witnesses, is entitled to have answers to our questions.",
  "Someone should tell Mr. Trump that he and Mr. Browder were both targeted by Fusion GPS, the political gun for hire that midwifed the Steele dossier in 2016.\"",
  "And we have the right to judge for ourselves whether our system of justice is operating fairly, within the Constitution, and consistent with civil liberties.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, you know, Maria, 224 House Republicans, all but 12 of the Republicans in the House, have voted for one of the two measures that we offered.",
  "We just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief, and do some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.",
  "But what it also shows us is that there is potentially a violation of the United States Supreme Court decision called Franks vs. Maryland and its progeny.",
  "What Lieberman writes is that he's hoping that Crowley's name is on the ballot, because the idea to abolish ICE came from her, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez.",
  "And there was one text from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page that basically says there's no there there when the Robert Mueller investigation launched, correct?",
  "And now we have a federal judge who agrees that information regarding that investigation can and should be made public and has ordered it be made public.",
  "That is what they used to get the warrant, the former British intelligence officer hired by a research firm working for Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.",
  "Vladimir Putin making the proposal in exchange for allowing special counsel Robert Mueller access to the 12 Russians indicted by the Justice Department.",
  "And in the contested cases, lawyers have a gold mine to work with, defense lawyers, challenging this FISA application, challenging Strzok's objectivity.",
  "Look, is it high time we all admit that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign because it was a political enemy and there was an election?",
  "We will keep working on it, but let's -- let's look at those votes, Maria, to show there are serious Republican plans to secure this country's border.",
  "You were traveling back and forth all the time, when you were -- became aware of corruption going on, oligarchs stealing money from Russian companies.",
  "So, John Brennan, he's the man who deserves a belated bit of scrutiny, according to The Wall Street Journal, Kim Strassel's op-ed just this past week.",
  "We know that John Brennan has been all over town trashing President Trump and trashing the hearing that your committee actually did with Peter Strzok.",
  "And every single Democrat voted no because Nancy Pelosi bullied them and threatened them and said she didn't want to provide Donald Trump with a win.",
  "And my sense is that they used this idiotic document that was an opposition research document to go violate the FISA rules and all of the rest of it.",
  "Joining me right now with his first reaction to all of this is House Judiciary Committee Chairman and Virginia Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte.",
  "I know that you had behind-closed-door meetings with her, but, apparently, during that hearing, you have discovered more information that you want.",

  "I think what you have got to look at are the actions that President Trump has taken to stand up against Putin and to stand up against Russia.",
  "President Trump said yes and actually sold them those missiles, so that they can defend their country and push Russia out of Eastern Europe.",

  "Republicans are working on their strategy to retain control of Congress come November amid talk of a blue wave in the upcoming midterms.",
  "Let's show you -- the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote a piece about you this weekend, saying, Donald Trump, meet Bill Browder.",
  "The real question is, will every Democrat vote no, like they did last time, now knowing how well it's working for middle-class families?",
  "And we have said all along we're not interested in looking at the substance of anything that Mr. Mueller does find in his investigation.",
  "BARTIROMO: And the editorial board did an op-ed on that, asking the president to actually make sure that you declassify these documents.",
  "I'll speak exclusively with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise about the Republican leadership's strategy to keep control of the House.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, we're going to go through -- we have received a list from the Intelligence Committee of literally dozens of people.",
  "And if you omit important information or fail to disclose information that might discredit the source, there's a real legal problem.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: Well, we will see, first of all, whether any of this appears in Mueller's report, because there's going to be a report.",
  "SCALISE: The plan is to continue focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth, and then locking it in.",
  "I think I would rather leave it at that, but certainly we will also be talking to Director Comey and former Attorney General Lynch.",
  "GOODLATTE: Well, we have lots of questions for John Brennan, and he will definitely be sought by the committees for an interview.",
  "Your reaction to what we have received in terms of this FISA warrant, which is heavily redacted, every page, massive black spots?",
  "BARTIROMO: And then they re-upped it and got -- they had to get additional sign-offs on it three times with the same information.",
  "It shows the FBI relied on the discredited Steele dossier as a major component to apply for surveillance warrants on Carter Page.",
  "In terms of the Hillary Clinton campaign contributions, I have given zero, zero contributions to Hillary Clinton in any campaign.",
  "And I think it is critically important that the American people have the opportunity to see most of the rest of those documents.",
  "Let's see what are known as the Woods notes, where the FBI goes through and figures out what they can put in the FISA document.",
  "I would say 90 percent of redactions are generally designed to cover people's incompetence, and they're not national security.",
  "But this was going on for almost a year before he came on the scene, and still is a cloud, a shadow over this administration.",
  "BARTIROMO: It's an interesting situation, because when you look at the past in terms of Vladimir Putin, there's your story.",
  "And he figured out that they seized those documents to steal $230 million of taxes that we paid to the Russian government.",

  "Putin made the suggestion during that Helsinki news conference with President Trump, calling out my next guest by name.",

  "We also have much to discuss with you, including that showdown with Democrats over a House resolution to support ICE.",

  "So, the Department of Justice discovered that there was some of the money from the Magnitsky case in New York.",
  "I hope they keep going around and letting people know that's what they would do if they were in the majority.",

  "To be opposed to the things that are helping rebuild our middle class is a losing strategy for Democrats.",

  "All right, we are going to keep watching that and wonder when the Robert Mueller report will be out.",
  "If Carter Page was an agent of foreign power, why is he still running around with no charges, James?",
  "So, I think this is another argument for the president to declassify everything, get it out there.",

  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: We're back with House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte.",
  "And one priority is help in silencing businessman and human rights advocate Bill Browder.",
  "SCALISE: Well, I hope she is, because it shows such a dramatic shift to the radical left.",
  "And this whole thing got started -- Carter Page is not an operative for the Soviet Union.",
  "The problem was the Trump campaign didn't have the big significant foreign policy people.",
  "And, look, it's a stark contrast with the radical left's agenda right now in Washington.",
  "Alan Dershowitz weighs in next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.",

  "I want to talk about what the Democrats, though, are going to do in response to that.",
  "That case says, when you make an application for a warrant, you have to be truthful.",
  "I mean, Russia and the Soviet Union have had these nuclear warheads for a long time.",
  "This is not -- you don't make friends and buddy-buddy up to a hostile, malign power.",

  "We have much greater access to unredacted documents than we have had before.",
  "And I think...\n\nBARTIROMO: It feels, at this point, we are seeing a new era.",
