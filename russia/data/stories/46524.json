  "On Aug. 1, HUD chief of staff Sheila Greenwood sent a message to the department’s staff announcing a group of hires, including Hunter, according to an email shared with HuffPost by a HUD employee:\n\nFormer HUDster Matthew Hunter returns to us as Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management, bringing 25 years of experience in data science and audience engagement to the Department.",
  "Matthew Hunter was the director of political affairs at Cambridge Analytica, which is at the center of a scandal for taking private information from more than 50 million Facebook users largely without their permission.",
  "A top official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development previously worked at the controversial political data firm Cambridge Analytica, but that job is not listed on his official bio on the agency’s website.",
  "Hunter’s official HUD bio, however, has no mention of Cambridge Analytica, even though it was the job he held right before his political appointment to the Trump administration.",
  "The firm worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as well as those of other Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Ben Carson, the current HUD secretary.",
  "The firm is facing multiple investigations over its data harvesting practices, but these specific individuals don’t face any known allegations.",
  "Hunter didn’t return requests for comment about the dates he was employed at Cambridge Analytica and why his bio omits his previous employer.",
  "As HuffPost reported Thursday, Kelly Rzendzian, a special assistant to the secretary at the Department of Commerce, worked at SCL Group ?",
  "The résumé she used to apply for the government job says she worked at Cambridge Analytica at that time.",
  "There is, of course, nothing wrong necessarily with hiring people who worked at Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Hunter isn’t the only Cambridge Analytica employee working as a Trump political appointee.",
  "Matthew most recently served as Director of Political Affairs with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "HUD Matthew Hunter's bio doesn't list his previous job at Cambridge Analytica.",
  "A slightly different but similar version of this announcement is online here.",
  "Cambridge Analytica’s parent company ?",
  "from March 2016 through February 2017.",
  "HUD’s press office also didn’t reply."
