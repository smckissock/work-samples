  "Here's Zuckerberg in the Segall interview: \"If you told me in 2004 when I was getting started with Facebook that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, I wouldn’t have really believed that that was going to be something I was going to have to really work on 14 years later, but we're here now, and we're going to make sure we do a really good job at it.\"",
  "In fact, the whole issue of apologies—are they good or bad, meaningful or not, do they come soon enough or too late, are they sidestepped altogether—has been a steady undercurrent in the last couple of years of social transformation where “fake news,” the #MeToo movement, public misbehavior and unprecedented personal attacks on social media by the president (and others) have permeated our daily experience.",
  "Would the public allow him to acknowledge the tension inherent between privacy and data security and a business model that offers a beloved free service to two billion people in return for selling their data to legions of businesses?",
  "Zuckerberg’s apology tour began in late March when he first voiced regret for the massive, illicit grab of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica: \"This was a major breach of trust and I’m really sorry that it happened.",
  "Never, ever say any version of, “I’m sorry if you felt upset by what I did.” You’re dodging responsibility for having done anything wrong with that deadly “if.” Indicate what you’re going to do about the problem.",
  "Although typical Facebook users don't give it much thought, in return for this marvelous free service, they provided the company with personal data that Facebook could use in myriad ways to generate income.",
  "After noting the good that Facebook and the connectivity it provides can do, Zuckerberg wrote: \"But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.",
  "The obligation of the apologizer is to care that he has wronged someone and then craft an apology in a way that any reasonable recipient would experience it as sincere, meaningful and satisfying.",
  "Rating Zuckerberg’s Apology from a Psychological Perspective\n\nTaking responsibility\n\nZuckerberg definitely took responsibility for the Cambridge Analytica disaster and related catastrophes.",
  "Focusing on the recipient\n\nHe didn’t yell, “I said I’m sorry, what more do you want?” But Zuckerberg did dwell a bit too much on the facts of what happened and about his own response to it.",
  "Essentially, Zuckerberg needs to add to his apology an acknowledgment of the emotional turmoil this breach has caused, along with a specific regret that he didn't protect people from that.",
  "To use the Facebook example, a successful apology from Zuckerberg would mean that the center of public attention would shift naturally from his apology to what is going to happen next.",
  "Zuckerberg would do better to show a little more humility, acknowledging that Facebook’s growth, reach and impact has galloped past anything he or anyone else could have imagined.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before Congress this week about the Cambridge Analytica data breach, election meddling and related catastrophes.",
  "When someone breaches our trust, hurts our feelings, attacks us or otherwise causes injury, our relationship with them is temporarily out of order.",
  "Zuckerberg’s apology stressed that the data breach should never have happened and reaffirmed his obligation to his customers to protect their data.",
  "There is simply no amount of money that would be worth bearing responsibility for the survival of democracy, the fate of nations and the truth.",
  "We have a basic responsibility to protect people’s data and if we can’t do that we don’t deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.",
  "In a March 21 interview with CNN’s Laurie Segall, he said, “This isn’t rocket science,” implying the fix wouldn’t be that difficult.",
  "The emotional trauma is not about stolen belonging, but rather the sudden loss of the feeling that you were safe in your own home.",
  "Saying what you’re going to do to repair the situation\n\nHe did fairly well, although not outstandingly, on this dimension.",
  "A crime we can’t get our minds around, an impact that is unfathomable, something new and strange and full of uncertainty.",
  "No doubt Zuckerberg's apology tour will continue, alongside cries of foul and demands for change in company practices.",
  "Though a good apology is certainly indicated here, I do wonder if there's an aspect of scapegoating Facebook going on.",
  "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.",
  "Consumers have loved the opportunity it provides to connect with friends and advance their causes and businesses.",
  "More acknowledgment of the emotional impact of the revelations on Facebook users would have balanced the focus.",
  "Apologies occur in a two-person system—there’s the person who offers the apology and the one who receives it.",
  "And perhaps the wrong-doer needs to apologize so that he or she isn’t bogged down in guilt or defensiveness.",
  "The social psychological purpose of an apology is to restore the damaged relationship to a working state.",
  "This framework puts an unnecessary moral spin on something that is really about the way groups function.",
  "He mentioned that AI tools successfully protected the elections in France and Alabama from interference.",
  "The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica burglary offers several additional layers of unsafety and uncertainty.",
  "They're upset, not about the data breach but because something unfathomable and unanticipated happened.",
  "Acknowledge both the emotional and practical consequences of the wrong done to the apology recipient.",
  "We didn’t even know this kind of crime could occur, and we don’t really understand the implications.",
  "But the timing, quality and impact of Zuckerberg’s apology have received microscopic attention.",
  "He conveyed that he wants to fix the situation, but was less than convincing that he knew how.",
  "Now both Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook users are grappling with the cost.Updated 4/9/18 6:00 pm",
  "We make apologies because we depend on trusted relationships to move life forward smoothly.",
  "We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.",
  "But listening to him, I had a lingering a feeling that he wanted to make excuses.",
  "Clearly, the central issue related to the data breach is its impact on democracy.",
  "Never saying, “I’m sorry if you were upset”\n\nZuckerberg did well on this one.",
  "This is where the apology flags because it doesn't reach people emotionally.",
  "Rationally, everyone is upset that their data has been stolen and misused.",
  "I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.\"",
  "So, our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn’t happen again.\"",
  "Five Components of an Effective Apology\n\nTake full responsibility.",
  "They're worried about what other unforeseen disasters could occur.",
  "Focus on the recipient and their feelings rather than yourself.",
  "Predictably and necessarily, the remarks contained an apology.",
  "Above all, the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook story is creepy.",
  "Acknowledging the impact\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.",
  "Make sure you actually care about the impact and show it.",
  "“It will never happen again” is great if you can deliver.",
  "I have to confess I feel sympathetic to Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "They're confused about what to do and feel unprotected.",
  "The Psychology of Apology\n\nWhy do we apologize anyway?",
  "Do we “deserve” an apology when we’ve been wronged?",
  "“I will do everything I can to fix it” is fine too.",
  "On Monday, Congress released his prepared remarks.",
  "It doesn't matter that he’s a multi-billionaire.",
  "He spoke sincerely of a major breach of trust.",
  "The evidence that an apology is successful?",
  "But emotionally, they’re just freaked out.",
  "The experience is like that of a burglary.",
  "The service was only free on the surface.",
  "I think he wavered a little on this one.",
  "All human enterprise is interdependent.",
  "What makes for a successful apology?",
  "It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.",
  "When is an apology necessary?",
  "Somehow it wasn’t reassuring.",
  "I don’t even use Facebook.",
  "Do we “deserve” apologies?",
  "Both parties can move on.",
  "No excuses.",
  "Be honest."
