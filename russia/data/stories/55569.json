  "Despite our federal, decentralized system of voting, can we nonetheless implement measures to prevent voting fraud in 2020, when technologies to manipulate voting data will have improved?",
  "As I have written before in these pages, the rules of the game for choosing our presidents need to be changed, but that discussion concerns future elections, not this past one.",
  "During the campaign, mentions of foreign meddling quickly became partisan and polarized, blocking any real examination of the facts, let alone a discussion of prescriptions.",
  "Thankfully, this clear Russian capacity to disrupt Election Day activities, including vote counting, does not seem to have led to actions influencing the election outcome.",

  "Should Sputnik and RT employees be accredited as journalists or as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act?",
  "We do not know precisely if the Russian government or its intermediaries transferred the data they stole to WikiLeaks.",
  "Such regulation seems hard, in tension with our First Amendment, but shouldn’t our lawmakers wrestle with the issue?",
  "We also know that WikiLeaks did not publish similar kinds of data from the Trump campaign or the Republican Party.",
