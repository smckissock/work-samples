  "17\n\nSo I can tell\n\nIn the early -- the very first weekend that I\n\n18\n\nstarted boning up on Donald Trump, you know, I\n\n19\n\nfound various references to him having connections\n\n20\n\nto Italian organized crime and later to a Russian\n\n21\n\norganized crime figure named Felix Sater,\n\n22\n\nS-A-T-E-R.\n\n23\n\ngreat achievement, it was in the New York Times,\n\n24\n\nbut as someone who has done a lot of Russian\n\n25\n\norganized crime investigations as a journalist\n\nIt wasn't hard to find, it wasn't any\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 68\n\n1\n\noriginally that caught my attention and became\n\n2\n\nsomething that, you know, I focused on while other\n\n3\n\npeople looked at other things.",
  "24\n\n25\n\nSo through this period while\n\nWe\n\nIt was a -- you know,\n\nIn the course of doing this research into\n\nwhat he might not want to be asked about from his\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 46\n\n1\n\nhistory in Russia we began to learn about the\n\n2\n\nhistory of his tax avoidance in Russia and we began\n\n3\n\nto deconstruct the way that his hedge fund\n\n4\n\nstructured its investments in Russia and, you know,\n\n5\n\nwe gradually accumulated through public records,\n\n6\n\nnot all from Russia, that he set up dozens of shell\n\n7\n\ncompanies in Cyprus and other tax havens around the\n\n8\n\nworld to funnel money into Russia and to hold\n\n9\n\nRussian securities.",
  "18\n\nSo, you\n\nAs it happens, Felix Sater was, you know,\n\n19\n\nconnected to the same Russian crime family that was\n\n20\n\nat issue in the Prevezon case, which is the\n\n21\n\ndominant Russian crime family in Russia and has a\n\n22\n\nrobust U.S. presence and is involved in a lot of\n\n23\n\ncrime and criminal activity in the United States\n\n24\n\nand for many years was the -- the leader of this\n\n25\n\nfamily was on the FBI most wanted list and lives\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 69\n\n1\n\nopenly in Moscow as a fugitive from U.S. law for a\n\n2\n\nvery elaborate stock fraud.",
  "21\n\nSo the first thing, you know, in any case\n\n22\n\nreally is to sort of try and figure out whether\n\n23\n\nyour own client's story can be supported or whether\n\n24\n\nit's not true, and the lawyers -- you know, we work\n\n25\n\nwith a lot of prominent law firms and in many cases\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 39\n\n1\n\nthe first thing the lawyers need to know is whether\n\n2\n\ntheir client's story is real, whether it can be\n\n3\n\nsupported, you know, because in any new case you\n\n4\n\ndon't know whether your own client is telling you\n\n5\n\nthe truth.",
  "Alderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 24\n\n1\n\nGenerally speaking, when we do a research\n\n2\n\nproject for a new client and they ask us -- you\n\n3\n\nknow, they explain, you know, what situation\n\n4\n\nthey're involved in, if it's a lawsuit, for\n\n5\n\nexample, or some other dispute, a lot of what we do\n\n6\n\nis related to disputes, they say -- you know, we\n\n7\n\nsay we will conduct an open-ended inquiry that's\n\n8\n\nnot goal directed and the results of the research\n\n9\n\nwill guide whatever decision you want to make about\n\n10\n\n11\n\nhow to use it.",
  "10\n\nThis was, you know, a lot of what I\n\nThis was -- the main focus was on trying to\n\nAll of this -- his determined effort to avoid\n\n11\n\ntestifying under oath, including running away from\n\n12\n\nsubpoenas and changing -- frequently changing\n\n13\n\nlawyers and making lurid allegations against us,\n\n14\n\nincluding that, you know, he thought we were KGB\n\n15\n\nassassins in the parking lot of Aspen, Colorado\n\n16\n\nwhen we served the subpoena, all raised questions\n\n17\n\nin my mind about why he was so determined to not\n\n18\n\nhave to answer questions under oath about things\n\n19\n\nthat happened in Russia.",
  "8\n\n9\n\nSo we did that for a\n\nEdward Baumgartner helped a lot with that\n\nAnd, you know, around the -- similarly, there\n\nwas a deposition of a customs agent by one of the\n\n10\n\nlawyers who -- you know, in this initial effort to\n\n11\n\ntrace the origin of these allegations, where they\n\n12\n\ncame from, how they could have ended up with the\n\n13\n\nJustice Department, the first thing we did was\n\n14\n\ninterview the client, got their story, and\n\n15\n\ninterviewed the agent who worked on the case for\n\n16\n\nthe DOJ and that agent said he got all his\n\n17\n\ninformation from William Browder.",
  "When I refer to\n\n15\n\nthose together, I mean all matters related to the\n\n16\n\nJustice Department's lawsuit against Prevezon\n\n17\n\nHoldings Limited, as well as all matters related to\n\n18\n\nefforts with the media, government officials, and\n\n19\n\ncampaigns to overturn the Magnitsky Act, prevent\n\n20\n\nthe passage of the global Magnitsky Act, remove the\n\n21\n\nword Magnitsky from either law, the Russian ban on\n\n22\n\nU.S. adoptions of Russian children, research on Mr.\n\n23\n\nMagnitsky himself or Mr. Browder, Hermitage Capital\n\n24\n\nManagement and its affiliated companies.",
  "In most cases that I can\n\n25\n\nthink of we don't have one subcontractor working on\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 61\n\n1\n\nmore than one matter, but to the extent that would\n\n2\n\nhappen, we don't really -- when you're dealing with\n\n3\n\nsubcontractors you're giving them generally very\n\n4\n\nspecific assignments, find out what you can about\n\n5\n\nthis company or this businessman or this court\n\n6\n\ncase, whatever, and a lot of that you never get\n\n7\n\ninto who the client is.",
  "In the original period of the case\n\n12\n\nthe question -- the client's explanation for or\n\n13\n\nresponse to the government's allegations was that\n\n14\n\nthey originated with an organized crime figure in\n\n15\n\nRussia who had been extorting them and who they had\n\n16\n\nreported to the police and who had been jailed and\n\n17\n\nconvicted for blackmailing them, and they claimed\n\n18\n\nthat that was where these allegations originated,\n\n19\n\nwhich, you know, seemed remarkable because it was\n\n20\n\nin a Justice Department complaint.",
  "24\n\nhelp them figure out whether he could be subpoenaed\n\n25\n\nin the United States to give a deposition, and the\n\nThen the lawyers\n\nSo a lot of what I did in 2014 was\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n1-800-FOR-DEPO\n\nwww.aldersonreporting.com\n\nGlenn Simpson\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWashington, DC\n\nPage 41\n\n1\n\nfirst thing that we did was we researched the\n\n2\n\nownership and registration of his hedge fund, which\n\n3\n\nwas registered in Delaware and filed documents with\n\n4\n\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.",

  "17\n\nThey were putting their companies in Kalmykia that\n\n18\n\nwere holding investments from western investors and\n\n19\n\nthey were staffing these companies -- they were\n\n20\n\nusing Afghan war veterans because there's a tax\n\n21\n\npreference for Afghan war veterans, and what we\n\n22\n\nlearned is that they got in trouble for this\n\n23\n\neventually because one of Putin's primary rules for\n\n24\n\nbusiness was you can do a lot of things, but you've\n\n25\n\ngot to pay your taxes.",
