  "To take that approach and to then apply that to a democratic system, where the reason why democracies have legitimacy in the first place is because people have autonomy and agency ... that is inherently undemocratic.”",
  "“One thing you want to do is identify the type of person you could exploit and undermine them psychologically,” Wylie told Forbes reporter Thomas Brewster onstage at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit in Boston.",
  "“You’d find people who were less resilient psychologically… you essentially tried to exacerbate distrust and paranoia.”\n\nIn the old days, this had to be done manually, person-by-person.",
  "Historically, in military offensives waged against groups like narcotics cartels in South America, operatives would plant people in organizations to infiltrate them.",
  "Wylie's role at Cambridge Analytica was to take traditional military \"information operations,\" or information warfare, and translate them into digital operations.",

  "In the U.S. in politics, that’s called the alt right.”\n\nForbes reporter Thomas Brewster interviews Chris Wylie at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit.",
  "They can feed them comments that affirm their thinking, giving the false impression that there are many more people who think the same way.",
  "Now he’s educating the public on how these tactics work, laying the groundwork for people to better arm themselves against undue influence.",
  "They begin to get this idea that there is a movement happening.”\n\nWylie added, “In the military, that would be called insurgency building.",

  "“They look around and see all these people who look and sound like them, talking about things they've been thinking about.",
  "When you’re engaging in information warfare, “the agency and autonomy of those people is not a consideration,” he said.",
  "“The idea that you’re treating voters in the same way that you’d treat a terrorist” made him change his mind, he said.",
  "If they invite 1,000 to 2,000 people to an event at a local coffee shop, 50 to 100 might show up and crowd the place.",
  "Let’s say an organization knows that only 5% of people who are invited to an event on Facebook actually attend.",
  "For example, with a fake Facebook profile, operatives can develop relationships with people online, Wylie said.",
  "“All of a sudden, this online fantasy gets translated into a very tangible reality,” Wylie said.",
  "And when did he decide he had had enough and to become a whistle-blower?",
  "“It’s fair game to deceive, undermine, exploit, manipulate and coerce.",
  "But with Facebook, you can do it digitally, on a much larger scale."
