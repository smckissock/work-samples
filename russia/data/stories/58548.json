Harrison praised APCO as “an invaluable supporter of the Clinton Global Initiative and its members since 2008.”\n\nSome of the specific work APCO did for CGI while Winer served at the firm in a senior capacity includes helping “CGI members garner interest for the causes they are addressing, demonstrate their success and highlight the wide-ranging achievements of CGI as a whole.” APCO also provided communication support for attendees at annual CGI Annual meetings, later boasting that one annual meeting alone “generated 3,416 print and online stories, including articles in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time, Vogue, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Forbes, The Huffington Post, Reuters and Bloomberg.”\n\nAPCO Worldwide recently faced controversy when The Hill reported that paid FBI informant Douglas Campbell, who infiltrated the Russian nuclear business world, claimed to three separate congressional committees in a written statement that Russian firms had hired APCO to influence the Obama administration and specifically Hillary Clinton.",
