  "Amnesty argues that pairing with Libya has not prevented departures or loss of life, but instead is “exposing refugees and migrants to even greater risks at sea and, when intercepted, to disembarkation back in Libya, where they face horrific conditions in detention, torture and rape.”\n\nMeanwhile the passage to Europe has only gotten more precarious, the smugglers have only gotten more brazen, and the boats they use have never been more ill-equipped.",
  "In 2015, Lady Joyce Anelay, then a minister in the foreign office, told the press, “We do not support planned search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean” as Britain believed such missions were “encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing.” But British authorities eventually backed away from that stance; it was too dangerous.",
  "Amnesty lists a number of reasons the death toll is ticking ever higher: the absence of satellite phones, boats leaving in poor weather and after dark, the use of flimsy rubber rather than wooden boats, and multiple boats launching simultaneously, making rescue difficult.",
  "Researchers visited the migrant receiving points at four Italian ports, spoke to FRONTEX, the for-hire coastal border patrol company, the Italian ministry of the interior, and Italian coast guard as well as non-governmental agencies working on search and rescue missions.",
  "Those trying to reach European shores include desperate migrants and asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, all making a dangerous voyage across the waters from Libya to Italy and from Turkey to Greece and then walking across Europe.",

  "In that piece, the Times indicated that the NGO boats that have moved ever closer to the coast of Africa over the last three years may have actually encouraged flimsier boats, and riskier refugee voyages.",
  "Worse still, the boats are leaving and barely making it beyond Libyan waters before they need assistance — that presents a problem and a challenge to Europeans trawling waters near Sicily, or in between.",
  "However, the ECFR report very specifically laid out that ending rescues was not the answer; instead it argues that Europe must open legal channels of migration in order to help close illegal channels.",
  "Not everyone will like that solution — especially when Europe has spent the bulk of the last months considering means of repatriation and convincing Libya to shoulder more responsibility.",
  "Amnesty’s report pins the blame squarely on European Union policies, which they call “reckless.” The EU has tasked the Libyan coast guard with aiding search and rescue operations.",
  "Just last week, Italy announced it was overwhelmed by the number of migrants arriving, and wanted to close off ports to NGOs who go all the way to Libyan waters to make rescues.",

  "Amnesty’s study is based on interviews with migrants, academics, journalists, UN organizations, the coast guard of Italy, and European parliamentarians.",

  "And Amnesty points out that European leaders have focused their attention on trying to dissuade people from leaving, rather than on search and rescue.",
  "But it is the testimony of the migrants themselves that brings home the horror of the largest human displacement since the Second World War.",

  "The European Council on Foreign Relations recently found only some 61 percent of migrants are not actually eligible for asylum.",
  "Amnesty has some suggestions: Bring more European rescue boats to the coast of Libya and open more legal routes for migrants.",
  "Many don’t make it, like Alan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy, whose lifeless body stirred the world if but for a moment.",
  "In the two years since this crisis began in earnest, migrants have begun leaving under riskier and riskier conditions.",
  "The idea that rescue ships are an enticement to refugees has floated through Europe off and on for several years.",

  "Last week, Italy floated the idea of blocking NGOs from using their harbors.",
  "It doesn't appear up to the job, and the consequences of failure are fatal.",
  "This summer, the search and rescue missions have never been more necessary.",
  "This year over 80,000 people have already made that treacherous voyage.",
  "Her conclusion was very similar to that of Amnesty International.",
  "But individual European countries are not thrilled by that idea.",
  "That, too, says the Amnesty report, is a tragedy in the making.",
