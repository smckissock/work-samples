  "On Monday, 20 current and former tenants of a one-time warehouse in Brooklyn that the Kushners are converting to luxury condominiums filed a $10 million lawsuit in State Supreme Court, claiming that the family’s business aimed to force them out with tactics like “loud and obnoxious drilling” and a “constant cloud of toxic smoke and dust.”\n\nAs a result, scores of rent-regulated tenants left the seven-story building at 184 Kent Avenue, in Williamsburg, and their apartments were sold to buyers for millions of dollars.",
  "“It certainly seems as if it was in the Kushners’ interest to oust the tenants,” a lawyer for the tenants, Jack L. Lester, said Monday at a news conference in front of the Supreme Court building in Downtown Brooklyn.",
  "Despite numerous complaints to the city’s Department of Buildings, tenants said, the dangerous conditions and the violation of city statutes persisted for about three years.",
  "The developer Charles Kushner, whose son Jared Kushner is a son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, has received a lot of attention in New York.",
  "“The construction activity, intentional or not, made tenants’ lives miserable and many left.”",
  "But perhaps not the way he, or his son, ever wanted."
