  "“This past Saturday, Trump’s attorney and shaved Peter Pettigrew John Dowd called for the immediate shutdown of the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.”\n\nColbert noted that Dowd’s statement was sent in an email to a reporter, and was followed by Trump’s tweet about Mueller, the first time he’s mentioned the special counsel by name, in which he called the investigation a “witch-hunt.”\n\n“This is significant because until now Trump had never attacked Mueller by name in a tweet,” Colbert continued.",
  "“However, it doesn’t help that for the last year Trump has been trashing McCabe on Twitter.”\n\n\n\nNoah went on to read many of Trump’s McCabe-centric tweets aloud while also bringing up an anecdote from a Trump encounter with McCabe, reported by NBC News, in which the president supposedly told McCabe to ask his wife how it feels to be a loser, an apparent reference to Jill McCabe’s unsuccessful run for Virginia state senate.",

  "“If being an asshole was an arcade game, he would have all the top scores.”\n\n“So in the end, Trump appears to have been extra vindictive about this,” Noah said, noting that the president had tweeted about McCabe trying to retire “with full benefits” and then fired him two days before his 50th birthday, causing him to lose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in benefits.",
  "McCabe had been under investigation of the inspector general of the FBI so to avoid looking like he’s trying to shut down the Russia investigation, all Trump had to do was not dance on McCabe’s grave.”\n\n“So he tweeted,” Colbert said, before reading the message aloud: “Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI – A great day for Democracy.",
  "“Because of that, people are now saying Comey got fired, McCabe got fired, who could possibly be next?”\n\nNoah concluded: “Robert Mueller, I don’t know when your next birthday is, but something tells the president may be planning a surprise.”\n\n\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nFinally, Seth Meyers discussed Cambridge Analytica, the data mining firm hired by the Donald Trump campaign.",

  "You forgot to mention that 50 million people had their private data breached, but every time it’s my uncle’s friend’s sister’s dog’s birthday I get a notification?”\n\n\n\n“On top of everything else, Cambridge Analytica is also being scrutinized by special counsel Robert Mueller for its entanglements with Russia,” Meyers explained.",
