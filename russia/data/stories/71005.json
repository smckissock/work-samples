  "“I cannot say that all of them, but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.”\n\nMoscow was just beginning to consider how to go about setting up more formal channels to communicate with the future Trump administration, said Ryabkov.",
  "Accused by defeated Democratic contender Hillary Clinton of being a puppet of President Vladimir Putin after praising the Russian leader, Trump has dismissed suggestions he had anything to do with the Russian government during the campaign.",
  "“We are doing this and have been doing this during the election campaign.”\n\nSuch contacts would continue, he added, saying the Russian government knew and had been in touch with many of Trump’s closest allies.",
  "But in comments that could prove politically awkward for the president-elect, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said there had indeed been some communications.",
  "Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions,” he said.",
  "A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
  "“Obviously, we know most of the people from his (Trump’s) entourage.",
  "“There were contacts,” Interfax cited Ryabkov as saying.",
  "He did not name names."
