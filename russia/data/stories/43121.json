  "With Facebook, you were friends, or not friends; in a relationship, single, or “it’s complicated”; popularity was easily quantifiable; those who chose not to sign up for Facebook were defining themselves as abstainers, whether they wanted to or not.",
  "It’s embarrassing to remember now my own decision, born of a hefty sense of my own too-coolness, that I would only ever respond to other people’s friend requests, and not send any myself, as if this were a meaningful form of self-definition.",
  "During those first few weeks of Facebook’s existence, while he was assuring his fellow college students that we could trust him with our identities, he had a private conversation on instant messenger with a friend.",
  "It was this article that prompted my roommates and me to start entrusting a stranger behind a computer screen with the keys to our identities: names, birthdates, photographs, email addresses, and more.",
  "You have full access to understand all, every piece of information that Facebook might know about you, and you can get rid of all of it.”\n\nZuckerberg was lying then and he’s lying now.",

  "But the Zuckerberg of 2018 sounds suspiciously like the “Mark E Zuckerberg ’06” who was interviewed by the Harvard Crimson on 9 February 2004 about his brand new website.",
  "Facebook isn’t going to kill me, but it has wormed its way into all of my relationships, caused me to infect other people, and I will never, ever be fully rid of it.",
  "It is as follows:\n\nZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard ZUCK: just ask ZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns FRIEND: what!?",
  "Like a lot of mistakes made at the age of 20 inside a college dorm room, it involved trusting a man I shouldn’t have, and it still affects me to this day.",
