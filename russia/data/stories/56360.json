  "As Martin Kenney, a lawyer specializing in shell companies, writes: “It’s not entirely beyond the realms of possibility that ISIS could be operating companies and trust funds domiciled in Delaware.” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may not live across the street from Joe Biden, but there’s little preventing him from opening his company just down the block — with the rest of us none the wiser.",
  "With the success of the department’s recent “Geographic Targeting Orders” (GTOs), which have pried into real estate purchases in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced this year that it would be expanding its writ, adding Honolulu as another metropolitan area where it will be pulling back the curtains on luxury sales.",

  "Documents revealed that Ross owned shares in a shipping company that in recent years earned nearly $70 million in revenue directly from a Russian company that happened to be co-owned by, of all people, Putin’s son-in-law.",
  "Until recently, no one had ever had to reveal the details of these transactions — what the source of the funds was, who was fronting the cash and which dictator’s daughter was moving into the neighborhood.",
  "And no matter how much it may grate upon the president, Congress — and legislators in California, Florida, Texas and New York — should pass laws ensuring transparency in high-end real estate purchases.",
  "Dictators and oligarchs have used U.S. property as a haven for their money, skirting sanctions and letting the properties sit vacant, all while driving up costs for the rest of us.",
  "The government could start by giving new life to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has now used to snare Manafort.",
  "Yet all these revelations highlight the pressing need for Washington lawmakers to start erecting defenses against the influx of grand corruption — while we still can.",
  "Manafort was even tied to the same Belize shell company that served as a conduit for illicit funds from corrupt leaders in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan.",
  "Over the past few weeks, Americans have acquired unprecedented insight into how corrupt leaders use the United States to protect and expand their ill-gotten wealth.",

  "It’s also time for the U.S. government to crack down on American states that have effectively transformed themselves into offshore havens for dirty money.",
  "Nor is there any reason to think that a president so keen on undercutting existing anti-corruption regulations would be interested in combating sleaze.",
  "All this comes in the wake of the indictment of ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort on charges of money laundering and tax evasion (among others).",
  "For years, corrupt actors overseas have poured their cash into luxury pads in Manhattan, McMansions in San Antonio, waterfront properties in Seattle.",

  "Such measures will hit the shady Americans — the consultants, the lawyers, the real estate agents — doing business with odious regimes abroad.",
  "To be sure, there’s no reason to think that the revelations about the financial machinations of those surrounding Trump will end anytime soon.",
  "You’d want to know if the apartment across the hall, or the brownstone on your corner, was a shield for protecting dictators’ dollars, right?",
  "As scholar Jahad Atieh writes, the Act has been “essentially self-policed” — rarely enforced with any real enthusiasm by the authorities.",
  "It’s time for this country to stop acting as an accomplice of the oligarchs and autocrats who are plundering their own populations.",
  "The kleptocrats who have used the United States as the safest store for their money will have to look elsewhere.",
  "We have legislation on the books, and officials who – as the Treasury Department shows – are willing to act.",
