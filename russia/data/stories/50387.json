  "Director of the Center for Security Policy Frank Gaffney told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon that Washington has a “willful blindness” to the desire of jihadists like the one who just struck in Nice, France, “to destroy Western Civilization from within.” He said that “more Americans are going to get killed because of it.”\n\nSaid Gaffney:\n\nWhat they are trying to accomplish worldwide is the supremacy of the doctrine they call sharia, and that simply means they run everything, and everybody else will be forced to submit.",
  "… This is a global jihad movement and its objective, whether it’s being carried out by the Islamic state, or by al-Qaeda, which says this would be the period of total confrontation, or whether it’s the Muslim Brotherhood.",
  "But strip away maybe that ten percent of sharia that involves religious practice and tradition and what you have is ninety percent of the same basic totalitarianism as Nazism, or as Communism, or as fascism.",
  "The thing that makes this one so dangerous, particularly to a society like ours … with its constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, is that its got a patina of religiosity to it.",
  "As for Newt Gingrich’s recent call to test Muslims in America to see if they support sharia, Gaffney said:\n\nFor some time, he’s been absolutely right.",
  "And it’s all about forcing everybody else to submit to the way that these totalitarians are seeking to impose.",
  "Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",
  "That’s what we’re having trouble getting our heads around.",
  "We’re dealing with … just another totalitarian ideology.",
  "This isn’t just some murderous jihadist lone wolf.",
  "And this is the thing that’s just so infuriating."
