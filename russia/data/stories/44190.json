  "More from USA Today:\n\nWhy women can't win when it comes to maternity leave\n\nFacebook now thinks 87 million had data shared with Cambridge Analytica\n\nOlympic taekwondo coach Jean Lopez banned for sexual misconduct with a minor\n\nBut the problem may not be confined to child care centers: A Tokyo-area employee at a cosmetics-related company claimed \"childbirth and child-rearing schedules\" were emailed to her and her 22 female colleagues, according to the newspaper.",
  "Brigitte Steger, a researcher on modern Japan at Cambridge University, told London's Daily Telegraph that post-war ideas on gender and labor remain active at many Japanese workplaces\n\n\"Women are being harassed for being selfish for taking time out to have children or look after them and for being inconsiderate towards their fellow employees — while women are also criticized for being selfish and not having children,\" Steger said.",
  "Yuichi Murayama, a child care researcher, told The Mainichi that the \"system in which each individual child care provider accumulated experience over many years has collapsed,\" adding that any pregnancy scheduling \"could be interpreted as a way for them to build experience over a long span of time without having to quit their jobs.\"",
  "\"Even when pregnancy rules are not strictly enforced, women are inclined to refrain from getting pregnant at the same time as their female colleagues who take maternity or child care leave, because they don't want to cause trouble to their other colleagues,\" Shirakawa told the newspaper.",

  "More than 47,000 children remained wait-listed for certified day cares in Japan last year, according to the Japan Times, placing mounting pressures on child care professionals.",
