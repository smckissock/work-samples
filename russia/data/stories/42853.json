  "Kogan and Chancellor founded GSR in May 2014 and, just weeks later in June 2014, according to reporting in the New York Times, the outfit accepted a contract for $800,000 to build the app for Cambridge Analytica.",

  "According to the company’s website, Joseph Chancellor is an employee of Facebook, where he works as a human-computer interaction researcher.",
  "Slate reported the connection last month, and the fact that Chancellor still appears to work at Facebook.",
  "The Intercept was the first to report, in 2017, that Facebook had hired the researcher.",
