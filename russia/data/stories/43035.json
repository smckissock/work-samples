  "Here are some instances where Facebook has demonstrated systemic mismanagement since 2015, according to Wieser:\n\nWhen it only sent a letter to policy violators in August 2016 after discovering that Cambridge Analytica and other entities extracted data from users in a way that violated its policies, without any follow-up or disclosure of the leak.",
  "Wall Street analysts have mostly been concerned about a potential slowing of digital advertising growth for Facebook, as well as rising costs due to efforts to combat recent issues by hiring content moderators and investing in the increased vetting of partners and advertisers.",
  "Wieser says Facebook could conclude that it has grown in a way that has proved untenable, which would depress the size of the company — or that it needs to significantly improve how it is managed, meaning it could see personnel changes in the not-too-distant future.",
  "Facebook's role in the distribution of misinformation and fake news, racism on the platform, and data-management violations in European markets including Germany and Spain should have been \"prevented or \"otherwise obviously better managed,\" Wieser says.",
  "\"What has come to light with the past week's revelations potentially represents a different class of problem when put in context with other issues that have arisen in recent months,\" Wieser wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.",
  "When the BBC reported photos of child abuse on Facebook to the company in March 2017, instead of tackling the problem, Facebook reported the BBC to the UK police for distributing the content that existed on its platform.",
  "\"Operational failures are in some ways more problematic, because they strongly suggest that even when the company intends to comply with its legal and commercial obligations, it is not always able to do so,\" he added.",
  "For instance, the research company eMarketer recently predicted that the US digital ad market share of Google and Facebook would fall for the first time this year, shrinking to 56.8% from 58.5% last year.",
  "While these missteps may be attributed to the company's explosive growth, Facebook should have made responsible managerial choices to ensure sufficient processes were in place to check them, Wieser said.",
  "Wieser note adds to a growing body of Wall Street research published in the past few days questioning whether the Cambridge Analytica scandal represents a \"fundamental risk\" for the company.",
  "When it initially denied and then acknowledged that its self-service advertising tools were gamed during the 2016 US presidential election and that it had unwittingly facilitated it.",
  "Facebook's stock dropped 9.5% over Monday and Tuesday, wiping out about $50 billion off the company's market capitalization, though it was trading up slightly on Wednesday.",
  "Wieser acknowledged that while Facebook had addressed some of these problems — and would presumably address the rest — investors had to consider how it evaluates itself.",
  "Win McNamee / Getty Staff\n\nFacebook is exhibiting signs of \"systemic mismanagement,\" says a new report published by Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research.",
  "\"We are unable to think of another company which has had as many operational problems as those which Facebook has experienced over the past few years,\" Wieser said.",
  "\"They are worse when third parties find the errors, because the company should have been looking to anticipate those errors before others found them.\"",
  "But now, Wieser is looking at Facebook's slew of recent concerns in a new light, cautioning investors that they stem from \"operational problems.\"",
  "During a string of major measurement snafus that have adversely affected advertisers' planning efforts and added to buyers' frustrations.",
  "Moreover, while many analysts continue to rate Facebook as a \"buy,\" Wieser has its stock as \"sell.\"",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg."
