  "Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell was concerned about Steele paying for information because sources “are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, ‘Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,’ because they want to get paid some more,” he said in 2017.",
  "Depending on the task and the length of engagement, the fee for collectors can be as much as two thousand dollars a day.” (RELATED: Former CIA Official Says No Evidence Of Trump Campaign Collusion)\n\nThe prospect of Steele paying intermediaries has been cause for concern for some former intelligence officials.",
  "MSNBC host Rachel Maddow touted it as a “staggering piece of reporting,” citing it as the biggest bombshell in the revelation that Steele wrote a memo alleging the Kremlin intervened to block President Donald Trump from selecting Mitt Romney as his secretary of state.",
  "Steele likely knew who funded the dossier\n\nSteele learned months after being hired by Fusion GPS that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were funding his investigation, according to Mayer.",
  "Salacious claims were based on secondhand information\n\nThe most shocking allegation in the dossier is that the Kremlin is blackmailing Trump with video footage of a tryst he had in a Moscow hotel room with prostitutes during a trip there in 2013.",
  "“The sessions were off the record, but because Steele has since disclosed having participated in them I can confirm that I attended one of them.”\n\nSteele did not distribute the dossier, provide evidence or identify his sources, Mayer said.",
  "“If a financial trail between Deripaska and Orbis can be established, it is likely to raise even more questions about Steele, because Deripaska has already figured in the Russia investigation, in an unsavory light,” Mayer reported.",
  "An attorney for Kramer, who until recently served as a director for the McCain Institute, “maintains that Kramer never considered getting Trump to resign and never promised to show the dossier only to McCain,” Mayer added.",

  "“A former national-security official who spoke with Kramer at the time told me that one of Kramer’s ideas was to have McCain confront Trump with the evidence, in the hope that Trump would resign,” she reported.",
  "That is a new revelation and raises even more questions about why the FBI failed to disclose the dossier’s funding sources in applications for spy warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.",
  "Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican, raised questions about any ties between the two, in a letter to Adam Waldman, an American lobbyist who has worked for Deripaska on visa issues since 2009.",
  "(RELATED: McCain Associate Invokes Fifth To Avoid Revealing Dossier Sources)\n\nFour days later, Steele provided Kramer and McCain with his final memo of what is now known as the dossier.",

  "Instead, the application stated only that Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, told him its client had a political bias against Trump.",
  "That’s because the veteran reporter was one of a handful of journalists handpicked by Fusion GPS to receive a briefing by Steele prior to the election.",
  "“These encounters were surely sanctioned in some way by Fusion’s client, the Clinton campaign,” Mayer wrote of her briefing from Steele and Fusion GPS.",
  "Manafort sent emails during the campaign offering briefings to Deripaska, to whom he reportedly owed nearly $20 million from a failed business venture.",
  "“To serve its clients, Orbis employs dozens of confidential ‘collectors’ around the world, whom it pays as contract associates,” Mayer reported.",
