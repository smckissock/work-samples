  "He has a more distinguished record when it comes to securing journalistic access, calling himself “a normal guy who has gotten into really unusual places.” He founded the Downtown Community Television Center, in 1972, with his wife, Keiko Tsuno; its Web site describes him as “the first American TV reporter to enter Cambodia after the Vietnam War,” “The only Western reporter to interview Saddam Hussein” between 1993 and 2002, and, in reference to Iran, “The last reporter to gain entry into the Embassy where the American hostages were being held.” In conversation, he is no less prone to pointing at the scoreboard.",
  "If it’s in your genes—your blood—you can play.” Fetisov, who serves as a senator in the Russian Duma, referred to Putin as “one of the most popular leaders in the world,” and added, “this is one of the most unique examples in the history of big politicians, to show they can play the hardest possible sport.” He meant this, he explained, in the sense of providing a healthy model for children, who might otherwise succumb to “street challenges,” like alcohol and drugs.",
  "After Donald Trump’s election, speaking into the camera, Alpert said, “All right, Slava, you finally got the guy in the White House that you want, and, um, now that America’s great again, we’re going to have to settle this like men.” Then he stick-handled around some cones, fired a puck off the post, and said, “You tell you know who that I’m waiting.” “When he gets set up for a shot, he’s not bad,” the filmmaker Jon Alpert said of Vladimir Putin’s hockey skills.",
  "Speaking to me a day after the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko revealed that he had staged his own death, in Kiev, to foil an assassination plot, Alpert said, “I do a lot of work with hero journalists in Russia, and my flirtation with Putin is a source of amusement but also concern.” But he stresses that he is able “to stick-handle and skate at the same time”—to curry favor, for access, and also remain honest and independent.",
  "We can find a parallel in hockey for everything that’s going on between Russia and the United States.”\n\nAlpert’s most recent documentary, “Cuba and the Cameraman,” which was released last year on Netflix, was his “life’s-work film,” he said: the story of four and a half decades of visiting that country, including a handful of exclusive meetings with its Prime Minister.",
  "He cited other examples of Putin’s “God-gifted” athleticism: “He can ride the horse, he can swim, he can skate, he can ski, he can do judo and sambo and karate.” One can be plenty familiar with Putin-related propaganda—the pectoral flaunting on horseback, the black-belt demonstrations—and still be surprised to hear it reinforced so explicitly in conversation.",
  "The host of an English-language RT show called “Worlds Apart” praised Alpert for his humanizing treatment of Castro, but cautioned him: “Be mindful of being branded as a Kremlin sympathizer, because I think, in this day and age, even appearing on this network may get you in trouble.” Alpert is aware of the risks of playing nice with strongmen.",
  "“I wish you success in solving America’s social and economic problems.” The film’s depiction of ordinary Cuban lives over the decades is affecting, and far from flattering to the regime, but Alpert still brought Castro a cake for his ninetieth birthday, in 2016, and proudly displayed Castro’s signature on his shirt.",
  "A largely positive review of the movie in the Times warned that Alpert’s “friendliness toward Castro and many of his policies will no doubt infuriate some viewers,” and mentioned that the filmmaker never explains “how he, an American, was able to enter Cuba for his first visits.” The answer, it turns out, is sports.",
  "Our job is to get access—and probably nobody else can get access.” Alpert recently met some Vice employees, at a hockey rink in Queens, who told him they were trying something similar; in his mostly maligned four-part series “The Putin Interviews,” Oliver Stone accompanied Putin to a rink but didn’t skate with him.",
  "Fetisov is revered by sports fans on two continents, not only for his grace on the ice but for his courage in standing up to the Soviet regime that sought to prevent him from playing in the United States—which, he told me, is the only country other than Russia where he can imagine wanting to live.",
  "The fact that relations between the two countries have devolved almost to Cold War levels is a source of distress for Fetisov, he said, and so, two months ago, in the interest of diplomacy, he smuggled an American filmmaker onto the ice in Sochi as a player on Putin’s opposing team.",
  "It showcases both Alpert’s revolutionary spirit—“We heard that Fidel Castro was implementing the social programs that we were fighting for in New York: free health care, universal education, and housing for everyone,” he says at the beginning—and his affection for big-game hunting.",
  "The undercover on-ice agent was Jon Alpert, a winner of sixteen Emmy Awards, and the career leader in penalty minutes—“No one is really close,” he says—for a New York- and New Jersey-based beer-league team called Gitler’s Gorillas.",
  "(In Saddam’s case, he told me, he had hoped that they would ride horses and shoot targets together, but he was ultimately summoned to a palace on short notice, and conducted the interview in “high-back chairs,” which he regrets.)",
  "“But he’s not very mobile.” In a letter addressed to Putin himself, Alpert included a photograph of his “mother’s grandmother’s cousin,” Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States under Lenin and Stalin.",
  "In April, Alpert went to Moscow for Fetisov’s sixtieth birthday, and while there he gave a number of television interviews in which he emphasized his experience with figures like Castro and Saddam.",
  "Alpert is sixty-nine and skates with the slightly bent ankles of a novice, although, as a hockey-besotted teen-ager, he tried, unsuccessfully, to walk onto the varsity team at Colgate.",
  "Years ago, Butman played as an occasional ringer on the Gorillas, when gigging in New York, and he remains a frequent participant in celebrity exhibitions like the one in Sochi.",
  "In 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Alpert brought his daughter to Cuba, and convinced Castro to write her teacher a note excusing her absence from school.",
  "“Western journalists ask me how it’s possible,” Slava Fetisov, one of Putin’s teammates and a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Detroit Red Wings, told me recently.",
  "“Everybody still talks about it.” Butman introduced Alpert and Fetisov to one another at the Moscow International Film Festival, in 2012, and a friendship bloomed.",
  "Alpert began sending Fetisov short, playfully taunting videos of himself practicing—sometimes shirtless, or against an anonymous opponent wearing a Russian jersey.",
  "His presence in Sochi was a kind of audition for a would-be film project he is calling “Putin on Ice.” Alpert wants to face off against Putin, one on one.",
  "“The way I made my film with the Cubans is, my amateur baseball team played the Cuban diplomats every Sunday for two years,” Alpert told me.",
  "“I’m really interested in what I think I can discover about Putin when he’s wobbling around on his skates and not comfortable,” he said.",
  "“Let’s say Pavel Bure or Sergei Fedorov”—Hall of Famers both—“score two goals, and the President scores five or six or seven.",
  "1 jazz personality,” as Ira Gitler, a jazz historian and the founder of Gitler’s Gorillas, has called him.",
  "In previous years, despite learning to skate only in his late fifties, he’d scored as many as eight.",
  "“We lost every game, but it worked out diplomatically.” With Russia, he’s taken a similar approach.",
  "He first met Castro in 1976, and later accompanied him on his plane to and from New York, in 1979.",
  "I say, ‘You have to be in the right time, in the right place.’ That’s what our President does.",
  "In May, playing hockey in an annual charity exhibition alongside a half-dozen former N.H.L.",
  "“I did the last interview with a guy before the Taliban cut his balls off,” he told me.",
  "“Igor’s the only guy that’s ever checked Putin and knocked him down,” Alpert said.",
  "“Cheating on face-offs, keeping your head up, using violence to settle disputes.",
  "stars, in Sochi, Vladimir Putin scored five goals and assisted on four more.",
  "“The people are so warm, so friendly, so patriotic,” he said of Americans.",
  "“Fortunately, when I get on the ice, I feel very big,” Putin tells him.",
  "His first connection was Igor Butman, a saxophonist and “Russia’s No.",
  "“You are a talented journalist,” Castro said.",
  "“I see us as family,” Castro told him.",
  "“I plan to use analogies,” he said.",
  "“Was I friendly with Fidel?",
  "He understands the game.",
  "He’s got a good shot.",
  "This is unteachable.",
  "I absolutely was."
