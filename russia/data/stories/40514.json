  "Dr. Antonius Hall, Professor of Globalization Studies at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, in his commentary for a video by former marine Ken O'Keefe, \"Ken O'Keefe and the Battle for 9/11 Reality\" decries \"The Totalitarianism Implicit in This Oppressive State of Affairs is No Where So Well Illustrated as in the Tactics Deployed to Block Out Evidence-Based Discourse From Most Media Venues, Elected Assemblies, and Educational Institutions Concerning the World's First Global Coup d'Etat Executed Through the 9/11 False Flag Terror Event.\"",
  "Finally, an article by Alex Lantier in The World Socialist Website, entitled, \"Blackwater mercenaries direct Kiev regime's crackdown in Ukraine\" supports the contentions of the previously listed sources, and adds, \"Significantly, US news media have completely blacked-out both the German and the Russian reports of Blackwater involvement in Ukraine.\"",
  "Author, poet, and former Canadian diplomat Peter Dale Scott describes the Deep State in an interview for the Voltaire network, as \"the wider interface in America between the public, the constitutionally established state, and the deep forces behind it of wealth, power, and violence outside the government.\"",
  "In an article entitled Harper's Plan Means Canada Will Be Associated With War Crimes Instead of Peacekeeping, I describe how the notorious International Republican Institute (IRI), an offshoot of the CIA, and funded by USAID, enabled the rise of Stephen Harper to the office of Prime Minister in Canada.",
  "One such event, which passed well below the corporate media radar was the \"coup\" that \"renovated\" Canada's indigenous Progressive Conservative Party (PC) into the hybrid, \"republicanized\", Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), reviled as it is by many informed Canadians.",
  "Instead of transferring vast sums of money from the public to the industrial military complex, and also the corollary: repression at home and abroad, structural deep state crimes need to be unmasked, and the perpetrators must be prosecuted.",
  "A critical mass of evidence presented by distinguished authors such as David Ray Griffin and Peter Dale Scott present enough credible information at this time to support indictments against credibly accused perpetrators.",
  "The Deep State that he describes is a type of largely unaccountable shadow or parallel government that operates at the international and domestic levels as a driver for policies in our so-called democracies.",
  "The illegal coup in Ukraine that violently overthrew the democratically-elected government of Viktor Yanukovych, another structural deep event -- this one international -- is changing the face of the world.",
  "confirms the Spiegel report and adds, \"Indeed, the German newspapers apparently claim that the American mercenaries are directing and coordinating the attacks by the fascist Right Sector militia.\"",
  "On a final note, the pretext for Islamophobia, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and now Syria, were the tragic false-flag events of September 11, 2001 -- another structural deep state event.",
  "And now a civil war rages in Ukraine, the result of a wide spectrum of foreign, deep state interference, for which the perpetrators are applauded when they should be condemned and prosecuted.",
  "Corporate media monopolies themselves are appendages of deep state, as they set narrow agendas and censor through omission, some of the most important issues facing civilization.",
  "As with other deep state events, the perpetrators of the 9/11 crimes remain at large, even as the event triggered the fraudulent \"War On Terror\" and its horrendous slaughters.",
  "A translated article, published by Spiegel On-Line, asserts that \"According to 'Bild am Sonntag' the Ukrainian security forces are supported by Academi 400 elite soldiers.",
  "Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and now Syria, have been all but destroyed by the West, and the ensuing \"terror\" has increased exponentially, as might be expected.",
  "This involvement is likely related to the unprecedented, and as yet largely unresolved, voter suppression issues that continue to plague our country.",
  "Another article, this one from Washington's Blog, and titled,\" \"Is the West DIRECTLY Responsible for the Massacres In Ukraine?\"",
  "Details of U.S clandestine funding of regime change have been suppressed though not entirely ignored by corporate media.",
  "German media, for example, noted that Academi mercenaries were, at the time of the report, on the ground in Ukraine.",
  "He adds, \"You might call it the back door of the public state, giving access to dark forces outside the law.\"",
  "It functions outside the reach of constitutional law, and it requires top-down forces of public repression.",
  "Transformative deep state issues that alter the face of society are described as \"deep structural events\".",
  "They should have led operations against pro-Russian rebels around the city EAST UKRAINIAN Slavyansk. \"",
  "But some core facts about the coup itself have been entirely omitted by North American media.",
  "The leaked Caracas Cable attests to the involvement of the IRI in Canada's domestic politics.",
  "Not surprisingly, some of these momentous but censored issues are also deep state issues.",
  "Today, the Deep State arguably supersedes the public government in power and importance.",
  "This article first appeared on Whatsupic\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST:",
  "The official narrative is simply too weak to stand."
