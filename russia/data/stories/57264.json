  "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime” that the careful distance between the research and the political entities that helped fund it only underscores the need to “connect the dots.”\n\n“There were so many in-between groups used to sort of shield direct control that it’s very clear that people on the one end, Russia, and on the other end, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign – they obviously wanted to create the inability to connect the dots.",
  "Perez, who was not at the DNC at the time, went on to defend the party’s efforts, saying “we had very strong reason to believe that Donald Trump and the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians were potentially conspiring to affect the election.”\n\nThe controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaign’s possible connections to Moscow.",
  "“You hire a lawyer – and we hire lawyers all the time who hire third-party vendors to do their work – and so we knew that we were paying for opposition research at the DNC, but we didn’t ask questions about who they’re hiring in the context of doing their research,” Perez told The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty, when asked to explained how he could have been in the dark.",
  "The confusion surrounding who pulled the strings on the Democrat-funded research resulting in the controversial Trump dossier has only emboldened Republicans looking to cut through the fog, amid signs the connections between the project and its overseers were murky by design.",

  "The Washington Post reported this earlier week — and Fox News confirmed — that the political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign.",
  "DEMS' DOSSIER DENIALS PILE UP\n\nAccording to the report, the Clinton campaign and DNC paid more than $9 million to Elias’ firm Perkins Coie that, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the research.",
  "Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on “Fox & Friends” that she doesn’t know which GOP candidate started backing Fusion but said Steele only got involved after the Democrats stepped in.",
  "Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel wrote that the disclosure of the DNC-Clinton connection suggests “there's something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more” in those records.",
  "In another twist, CNN reported that former Clinton campaign chairman Podesta privately denied any knowledge of the payment arrangement in recent interviews with congressional investigators.",
  "And when somebody goes through so many efforts through so many surrogates to keep that from happening, you have a special reason to want to connect the dots,” he said Thursday.",
  "In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.'s office,” Strassel wrote.",
