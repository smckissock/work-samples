  "Harding’s riveting book shows that the question is not whether the Kremlin helped Trump win the U.S. presidential election but whether it can be proved in court and whether it is punishable according to all too arcane U.S. law, which could not even sentence Al Capone for anything but tax evasion.",

  "He presents an overwhelming number of connections between Trump and his close associates with Russian intelligence and organized crime, and he digs into all of them with hard evidence.",
  "The three exceptions were David Corn in Mother Jones, Franklin Foer in Slate, and finally Buzzfeed, which sensibly published the whole dossier, but only in January 2017.",
  "This article by Anders Aslund, which first appeared on the Atlantic Council website, has been retracted by the Atlantic Council and removed from their website.",
  "Initially, Trump and his associates denied it all, but since they had to admit their many meetings with Russians, their guilt appears all the more evident.",
  "MIKHAIL KLIMENTIEV/AFP/Getty\n\nHarding met with the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele both before and after his famous dossier came out.",
  "The evidence against Trump is substantial: “Putin was practically the only person on the planet to escape Trump’s sweeping invective,” Harding writes.",
  "There are so many other connections between dubious Russians and the Trump campaign, apart from Michael Flynn, Carter Page, and George Papadopoulos.",
