  "The source said that Harris was “brilliant” and considered an innovative choice to lead the OMB because of Harris’s views about the federal deficit and corporate America.",

  "There is no evidence that Kushner ever personally discussed the Apollo loans with Harris or that he personally or formally offered Harris the OMB post.",
