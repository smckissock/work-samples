  "Justin Sullivan / Getty News Staff\n\nAs the latest news rages about how Facebook was exploited to manipulate voters by a company working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and for the Brexit vote, frustration is growing within Facebook's employee ranks.",
  "This firestorm involves a whistle-blower from a company called Cambridge Analytica who said the firm took data from 50 million Facebook users under false pretenses to target voters with ads and misinformation.",
  "\"We have a very open culture at Facebook and welcome feedback through all of our internal channels,\" Vanessa Chan, Facebook's director of communications, told Business Insider.",
  "Plus they are used to news reports about some scandal or another at the company and believe that the news media can be overly dramatic or mischaracterize things.",
  "Getty Images Employees were told their questions would be answered at an internal meeting, but neither Zuckerberg nor Sandberg participated in that meeting.",
  "Employees are going there to ask questions about Cambridge Analytica as well as Facebook's role in the 2016 US elections and Russian election interference.",
  "But many don't understand why Zuckerberg and Sandberg are ghosts, allowing the world to believe that the people of Facebook are doing terrible things.",
  "In the anonymous employee chat app Blind, one Facebook employee posted a message full of siren and fire emojis, saying, \"Those are my thoughts.\"",
  "Facebook says it was duped by the firm, which it said promised to delete the data after Facebook discovered its activities back in 2015.",
  "\"Everybody at Facebook in first year gets immunized to stories about Facebook â€” or they quit,\" one former Facebook employee told us.",
  "The upshot is, employees want to believe, and do believe, their company's explanation that it is not complicit with any bad actors.",
  "Another employee called the situation \"serious,\" but a third one joked, \"Is this how the downfall of Myspace happened?",
  "In fact, employees have also been active on Facebook's internal messaging groups, including one called \"Wait What?",
  "Ditto for the company's other famous executive, Sheryl Sandberg, who has also been radio silent on the matter.",
  "Blind makes sure the people using the app are employees by validating their work email addresses.",
  "Facebook staffers want their CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to speak up and defend the company.",
  "Many Facebook employees understand and are on board with the company's defense.",
  "As one former employee described, \"Why are you guys letting us get grilled?\"",
  "\"But there are plenty of people irked about this, about Facebook's silence.",
  "He didn't lead an internal company meeting that was held Tuesday.",
  "I'm just trying to figure out how worried I should actually be.\"",
  "Many employees are also engaging in some dark humor about it.",
  "The meeting was led by a Facebook lawyer, Paul Grewal.",
  "'Is this how the downfall of Myspace happened?'",
  "He hasn't posted on his own Facebook account.",
  "He has been noticeably absent on the issue.",
  "He has made no statements to the press.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "They want Mark to go on TV.\"",
