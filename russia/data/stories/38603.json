  "McKinsey calculates that 6 percent of US corporate bonds have been issued by companies which need to spend two-thirds of their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in order to meet their interest payments — leaving them in a perilous position when they are forced to refinance at higher rates.",
  "\"The raw material of this lending boom is not as fallacious as subprime [mortgages],\" he says, comparing the borrower-friendly terms of today's corporate loans with the fraudulent loans obtained by tens of thousands of homeowners whose defaults later brought the banking system close to collapse.",
  "And while asset managers are usually far less leveraged than banks — typically matching a dollar of equity with every dollar or two of debt, compared with the $20 or $30 that banks were borrowing ahead of the crisis — they often have far fewer safe assets such as US government bonds.",
  "Strong covenants were attached to fewer than 30 per cent of the leveraged loans written in the US last year, according to a tally by the IMF, leaving creditors with little power to intervene if management teams behave recklessly or a company's profit heads south.",

  "Howard Marks, the founder of Oaktree Capital Management who has made billions of dollars investing in distressed debt and profiting from the fallout of credit busts, agrees — up to a point.",
  "He also talked to insurance companies, which are large debt investors, and received offers from small banks that were willing to take risks, \"but the pricing on that was totally insane\".",
  "One-quarter of last year's buyouts involved \"adjusted\" ebitda, which inflates profits by adding back some costs that are usually deducted, flattering a borrower's stated leverage ratios.",

  "Until the financial crisis, private equity investors hewed closely to the \"buyout\" playbook pioneered by Henry Kravis and George Roberts when they founded KKR in the 1970s.",
  "Unlike banks, which are dependent on deposits and other short-term funding, these funds raise money from long-term investors such as insurance companies and pension funds.",
  "With interest rates expected to rise, that could be in prospect for a sizeable number of businesses whose cash flow offers little headroom above their interest payments.",
  "They have also set up a courtroom battle between Blackstone and KKR, two of America's most powerful financial firms, which are among the biggest lenders to the company.",

  "\"[People think that] things usually grow and therefore if I'm overly aggressive lending today it'll kind of catch up over time,\" he says.",
  "If you can grow your credit business faster than the equity side, even with lower returns [for investors], that's highly profitable.\"",
  "But then you have to put it to work, or sit on it and have people complain that you didn't do what you said you were going to do.",
