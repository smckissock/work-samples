  "“It is desirable that US troops stay as a peacekeeping force in Korea, instead of a hostile force against the North,” Kim Jong Il, the former leader of North Korea and Kim Jong Un’s father, reportedly said at a 2000 meeting between the two Koreas.",
  "Then in August 2003, the international community launched the so-called “Six Party Talks,” designed to get North Korea to halt its nuclear program through negotiations with five countries: China, the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Russia.",
  "“If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.”\n\nNorth Korea’s announcement, via Moon, comes just two days after CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s secret meeting with Kim over Easter weekend became public.",
  "In 1994, the US and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework, in which the North agreed to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for two proliferation-resistant nuclear power reactors and fuel oil from the United States.",

  "According to South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday, North Korea is ready for “complete denuclearization,” meaning that it would stop improving its nuclear weapons and missiles that can hit America and its allies.",
  "But then North Korean leaders usually go back to the same talking point: North Korea can’t give up its nuclear program because of the threat posed by the US military and its allies South Korea and Japan.",

  "“If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go,” Trump said at Mar-a-Lago alongside Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister.",
