  "That ranges from Mueller’s past professional relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May over the investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser; Mueller’s role in a controversial uranium asset sale to Russia in 2010; and members of Mueller’s staff who have been critical of Trump in private communications, including an FBI agent assigned to the team who texted a colleague that Trump was an “idiot.” (Mueller removed the agent, Peter Strzok, from the investigation immediately after learning about the texts last summer.)",
  "“What we ask is that they don’t allow those beliefs to affect their decision-making.”\n\n4) The Democrats allegedly paid for the Trump-Russia dossier\n\nThe dossier, an intelligence document written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, contains allegations that Russia colluded with the Trump campaign to win the 2016 presidential election.",

  "Strzok, a self-identified “conservative Dem,” texted Page that Trump was an “idiot.” He also wanted Clinton to defeat Trump in the election — in another message, he wrote: \"God Hillary should win 100,000,000 — 0.”\n\nAnti-Mueller conservatives are also pointing to Strzok’s August 15, 2016, text to Page.",

  "Last Friday, it reported that Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., and other members of the campaign received an email from WikiLeaks email on September 4, 2016.",

  "Mueller removed Strzok from his investigative team in July, and Strzok is now under investigation by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog.",
  "But again, there’s no evidence that Bruce’s meeting with Steele or Nellie’s work for Fusion GPS influenced the dossier’s conclusions in any way.",
  "Critics said such donations meant that Quarles — and by extension the Mueller probe itself — couldn’t objectively carry out the investigation.",
