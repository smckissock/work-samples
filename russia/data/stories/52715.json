  "Pence’s remarks – and Trump’s original claim at the UN security council that the Chinese “don’t want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade” – come at a time when the Trump campaign is under investigation for possible collusion with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favour.",
  "“As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.”\n\nChina described Pence’s speech as “unwarranted accusations” and said it “slandered China by claiming that China meddles in US internal affairs and elections”.",
