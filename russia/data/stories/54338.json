  "March 26, 2018: Michael Cohen’s attorney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Stormy Daniels after the 60 Minutes interview, accusing her of claiming that Cohen was “responsible for an alleged thug who supposedly visited Ms. Clifford, while she was with her daughter, and made an alleged threat to Mr. Clifford.” While Daniels did say that one of Trump’s representatives did this, at no point did she actually accuse Cohen.",
  "Nevertheless, the letter accuses her of “libel per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Daniels added a complaint in her lawsuit against Cohen, alleging defamation when on February 13 he stated in reference to claims of an affair that, “Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean it can’t cause you harm or damage,” implying that Daniels is lying about the affair.",

  "Rodriguez stated, “Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story.”\n\nThe same day, the gossip site the Blast reported that Daniels had held on to a “Monica Lewinsky-style” dress from her July 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, with his DNA on it.",
  "He alleged that Trump “purposely did not sign the agreement so he could later, if need be, publicly disavow any knowledge of the Hush Agreement and Ms. Clifford.”\n\nAvenatti’s contention was that Cohen wired Daniels $130,000 even though the agreement was null.",
