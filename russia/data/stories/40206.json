  "While not perfect, Season 6 manages to course-correct both the narrative and its treatment of its female characters, placing them in positions of strength and allowing their heroism (and villainy) to be just as complex as their male counterparts'.",
  "(Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Tyrion rules at King’s Landing, Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis shows up, Renly dies, Jon meets Ygritte, Theon betrays Robb, Dany goes to Qarth, Catelyn assigns Brienne to take a captive Jaime home.",
  "(Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Joffrey dies, Oberyn makes his entrance and later dies, Tyrion kills Tywin, Littlefinger kills Lysa, Brienne and the Hound fight, Stannis saves the Night’s Watch, Dany rules in Meereen, Ygritte dies.",
  "(Photo: HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Jon is resurrected and declared King in the North, Cersei kills everyone and takes the Iron Throne, Hodor dies, Arya kills Walder Frey, Tyrion helps fix Meereen, Dany and her many new allies sail for Westeros.",
  "(Photo: Nick Briggs, HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Ned goes to King’s Landing, Ned is beheaded, Sansa and Joffrey are engaged, Dany marries Drogo, Drogo dies, the dragons are born, Jon goes to the Wall, Catelyn captures Tyrion, the war begins.",
  "(Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Jon and Ygritte fall in love, Dany begins her crusade at Slaver’s Bay, Sansa and Tyrion marry, the Reeds help Bran, and Robb, Catelyn, Talisa and more are murdered at the Red Wedding.",
  "For fans of Tyrion, this may be the best season, because he's at the height of his power, ruling as Joffrey's Hand and giving profane inspirational speeches to his soldiers at the epic Battle of the Blackwater.",
  "(Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO)\n\nWhat happens: Sons of the Harpy plague Dany, Sansa marries Ramsay, Stannis burns Shireen at the stake, Cersei is “shamed,” Arya trains to be a Faceless Man and Jon is assassinated.",
  "Season 2’s biggest flaw is Dany’s boring story line in Qarth, which managed to make the show’s most engaging character feel small and pointless compared with the drama going on beyond the Narrow Sea.",
  "The ending of Season 6 featured both Cersei’s coup in King’s Landing and a narrative coup for the writers, who managed to streamline the convoluted story lines with a few chess moves of their own.",
  "The horror and awe inspired by the Red Wedding — Roose Bolton uttering “the Lannisters send their regards” endures as one of the series' best lines — pushed Season 3 to the top of the list.",
  "At this point in its run, the Thrones universe had expanded without becoming too confusing; every major character's story was riveting, and the bombastic events were smartly paced.",
  "There are some unfortunate choices (Ramsay’s prolonged torture of Theon, for one), but even without the Red Wedding, Season 3 is one of Thrones’ tightest and most entertaining.",
  "The backlash that hit the Internet after Sansa is raped by Ramsay in one Season 5 episode was impossible to miss, and afterward some viewers vowed to quit the show for good.",
  "Sure, there's the “Purple Wedding” (Joffrey is poisoned at his nuptials), Jon's conflicting loyalties (to Ygritte and the Night’s Watch) and the battles up North.",
  "Game of Thrones returns July 16 (HBO, 9 ET/PT) for its penultimate seven-episode season, which promises to begin wrapping up the show’s many storylines.",
  "But many of the major characters are stalled this season, including Arya, who wanders with the Hound, and Dany, who lamely attempts to rule Meereen.",
  "Coming off the ratings high, acclaim and pure shock of Season 3’s Red Wedding, the fourth season was always going to be a bit of a letdown.",
  "Season 5 encapsulates the worst of Thrones: Its biggest moments lean on violence, nudity and sexual assault, without much story mixed in.",
  "But the first season set the stage for the series to change dramatically, starting with the radical death of protagonist Ned Stark.",
  "It has been quite a long journey, featuring political power plays, wars, affairs, dangerous weddings and too many deaths to count.",
  "Each season has delivered elaborate production values, shocking twists and characters fans have come to love (and probably lose).",
  "Sign up for the Postcards from Westeros Newsletter\n\nAhead of its return, we take a look back at how the first six stack up.",
  "Season 3\n\nOona Chaplin as Talisa, Richard Madden as Robb and Michelle Fairley as Catelyn in Season 3 of 'Game of Thrones.'",
  "It also introduced characters compelling enough to draw viewers back after Ned’s death and the many others that followed.",
  "Much of the original cast is gone, and the then-crucial question of who sits on the Iron Throne seems less important.",
  "If Season 1 introduced Thrones to the world, Season 3, and specifically the Red Wedding, made it a phenomenon.",
  "It was lazy writing, offensive to many viewers and added up to a grotesque and underwhelming season.",
  "Season 5\n\nSophie Turner as Sansa and Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger in Season 5 of 'Game of Thrones.'",
  "Season 4\n\nPedro Pascal as Oberyn and Indira Varma as Ellaria in Season 4 of 'Game of Thrones.'",
  "This season also includes a controversial sexual assault that reversed Jaime’s redemption arc.",
  "Game of Thrones has, in a lot of ways, become a completely different series since its debut.",
  "It’s no coincidence that Thrones really began to sing again once it moved past George R.R.",
  "Ultimately it feels less vital and engaging than the seasons above it on this list.",
  "Thrones doesn’t have any rules, because it started out by breaking the biggest.",
  "Season 6\n\nLena Headey as Cersei Lannister in Season 6 of 'Game of Thrones.'",
  "CLOSE The new season of 'Game of Thrones' premieres July 16 on HBO.",
  "Season 1\n\nSean Bean as Ned Stark in Season 1 of 'Game of Thrones.'",
