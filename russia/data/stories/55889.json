  "(END VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nBRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It seems like the investigation into Russia efforts in 2016 may have taken a turn, or at least the tone has changed, this as some new revelations about a Democrat lobbyist, Tony Podesta, who is the brother of John Podesta, who of course was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, an investigation into what he did or his company did in relation to Ukraine.",
  "CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think just stepping back a minute, the fact that they are following up some sort of lead on a foreign agent registration possible violation by a Democratic firm suggests Robert Mueller is a straight shooter and not a partisan figure as he has been accused of being.",
  "BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I think the change in tone we are seeing among these committees that are investigating this, this is not the Mueller investigation but the Congressional investigation, is I think we are hearing more about Russia and less about collusion.",
  "And I think what you're saying that with Charles Grassley and the Justice Department is a continuation between -- there's a fight going on between the Republican-controlled Congress and the Republican- controlled Justice Department about all sorts of Russian information.",
  "REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: Last Congress in and the oversight committee wanted to investigate the Foundation and all the other payments involving the Clintons, and we were not allowed to do that by the leadership of the House for whatever reason.",

  "And now we have this totally different story which is Fusion GPS was actually getting funded or working on behalf of Russians to undermine sanction efforts against Russian oligarchs and Putin cronies and whatnot while doing this dossier.",
  "It coordinated with all these leaks we were getting about Michael Flynn having a conversation with a Russian or Jeff Sessions having a conversation with a Russian or Jim Comey did this briefing which pretty quickly made it to the media.",
  "The Podesta Group issued a statement saying the firm is cooperating fully with the special counsel's office and has taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms timely compliance in all of our client engagements.",
  "Just on the surface it doesn't seem like the crime of the century that they are running down on Tony Podesta, a failure to register when it seemed like he was working some kind of subcontractor to Manafort on a still murky episode.",
  "Back when this all came out at first, FOX News was part of the news organizations along with The New York Times, and Peter Schweizer with the book \"Clinton Cash\" who first covered this Uranium One tie with the Clinton Foundation.",
  "BAIER: So on the Uranium One deal, the new wrinkle to that is that an informant, Congress wants to talk to this FBI informant tied to this case, and so far the Department of Justice has squelched it, the ability.",
  "But originally this was the entire basis of the Trump-collusion narrative, that this dossier suggested that there was something very nefarious going on, and this was used to undermine the incoming administration.",
  "Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent of The Washington Examiner; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post.",
  "It has morphed into, we are told, a criminal inquiry into whether the firm violated the foreign agents registration act, and the tie to Paul Manafort, the one-time campaign manager of the Trump campaign.",
  "But I do think, again, stepping back and looking at the big, big picture that we're getting here, maybe collusion is receding, but there was a lot of Russian activity in America over the last few years.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I would say it is the same baloney they have been peddling for years, and there's been no credible evidence by anyone.",
  "One thing on the uranium, a lot of it is framed in terms of the Clintons, but Hillary Clinton argued, and she was right, that she is not the sole person who made this decision about the uranium.",
  "This is just a dramatically different story than we have been getting and requires a lot more of those great investigative journalism things we've been seeing on the Trump thing.",
  "BAIER: So what this amounts to in the end is a Russian company essentially controlled by Vladimir Putin will now be in charge of a substantial portion of American uranium.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: We had a lot of details, tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, a lot of speaking fees tangentially for former president Clinton.",
  "SCHWEIZER: Fernwood Foundation is an entity in Canada controlled by Ian Telfer who ends up being the chairman of Uranium One, which is the Russian owned uranium company.",
  "If you look at public statements of the people who are running this thing, they are talking more about the active measures Russia took, like the Facebook ads.",
  "And then when you get something like the uranium deal, that takes it further from the whole collusion idea, which used to be the heart of the investigation.",
  "And from what I've heard, talking to a number of people involved in this, they just don't seem to have the evidence that's pointing them toward collusion.",
  "The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources?",

  "The House Intelligence Committee controlled by Republicans on August 24th subpoenaed the FBI for information about the dossier.",
  ": This outfit here in Washington D.C., Fusion GPS, has gone to the greatest lengths possible to try to conceal who paid them.",
  "LANE: I was going to say another thing we are learning today is that once the special counsel gets going, he never stops.",
  "BAIER: It's important to have a caveat that we don't know what we don't know about the special counsel's investigation.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: So what happened to Giustra's company that benefited from that deal in Kazakhstan?",
  "I'm not surprised, but I think the real story is how nervous they are about these continuing investigations.",
  "And now you have Senator Grassley, Byron, talking about really wanting to talk to this guy, what he knew.",

  "HEMINGWAY: This is something we should've learned a long time ago.",
