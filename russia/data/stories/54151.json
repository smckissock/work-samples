  "Cohen's use of a law firm connected to Trump's campaign and his company further blurs the line that Cohen is trying to draw in arguing that his payments to Stormy have no involvement of the president.",
  "That was a jump from the previous payment it received from the campaign in September 2017, when it took in about $2,400, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
  "A year earlier, in the weeks around the presidential election, the law firm received five total payments from the Trump campaign, totaling about $81,000.",

  "The law firm earned roughly $30,500 from Trump's presidential campaign fund in October and November 2017.",
