  "Mark Zuckerberg criticized for his lack of answers in Brussels testimony 9:40 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 00:53\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's meeting with European lawmakers in Brussels on Tuesday has been criticized by political representatives for being too short and providing \"no answers.\"",
  "\"I was really not satisfied with the hearing yesterday because Zuckerberg gave no answers whatsoever,\" Ska Keller, co-head of the Greens-European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament, told CNBC in a phone interview Tuesday.",
  "Zuckerberg's appearance in the European Parliament was facilitated by Antonio Tajani, the parliament's president, and consisted of around an hour of questions and less than 10 minutes of answers.",
  "\"That was facilitated by the format, that there was no possibility to ask follow-up questions so that was definitely a very big problem created by the parliament's president.",
  "\"It also asked to have a meeting with Zuckerberg and a hearing with a senior Facebook executive and other digital platform managers in the civil liberties committee.\"",
  "\"The meeting format was decided by the Conference of Presidents,\" Tajani said in an emailed statement to CNBC.",
  "But he really didn't and was just repeating what he said in his opening statement, so really nothing new.\"",
  "But still, Zuckerberg could at least have answered some questions more precisely.",
  "CNBC understands that the format of the meeting was requested by Tajani."
