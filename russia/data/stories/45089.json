  "That’s why both companies and individuals will benefit from a system that uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect their identities, private data and competitive business intelligence while tracking necessary business information.",
  "Blockchain systems, like those offered by the San Francisco-based technology company, Chronicled, can provide track-and-trace capabilities and full visibility into supply chains in practically every industry.",
  "Known for its widespread use in Zcash, zk-SNARK is an acronym for “zero-knowledge, Succinct, Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.”\n\nIt’s a mouthful to say, but its capabilities are simple.",
  "zk-SNARK is a form of cryptography that proves possession of certain information without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.",
  "These proofs are allowing blockchain companies to build smarter, automated systems that can attest to certain facts without revealing the data behind those facts.",
  "The revelation that millions of Facebook users’ data were breached by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has sent a jolt through the tech world.",
  "Finances and transactions are generally held to be private information, the publicizing of which could put individuals or companies in compromising situations.",
  "Rather than recording all the data from a business transaction or process, zk-SNARKS allow businesses to store only the proof of the transaction on a node.",
  "Both companies and individuals have reasons to keep sensitive information private, while still reaping the benefits of a decentralized blockchain network.",
  "Your childhood math teachers probably told you time and time again, “You have to show your work.” You had to prove the steps that led to your conclusion.",
  "Instead of making all that information public, users can choose to pay others with anonymous “zerocoins.”\n\nzk-SNARKs are also necessary for the future.",
  "zk-SNARK technology may seem modern because it’s being used in blockchain systems, but the first zero-knowledge proofs were developed in the late 80s.",
  "With the amount of data people provide to companies like Facebook, it’s essential to have ways to protect information and keep sensitive data safe.",
  "If zero-knowledge proofs were involved, the bouncer could run a program to scan the ID and determine whether the man was at least 21 years old.",
  "As the world becomes further automated, and as companies collect more and more data, privacy and data protection will become paramount.",
  "In 2012, Alessandro Chiesa, a professor at UC Berkeley and co-inventor of Zerocash, co-authored a paper that coined the term zk-SNARK.",
  "That’s important because while greater transparency has long been the goal of many blockchain advocates, transparency has its limits.",
  "There are a number of situations where the parties completing a transaction don’t want that information to be publicly available.",
  "That’s a non-starter for most companies, especially those with sensitive business intelligence they want to keep to themselves.",
  "Companies can keep their sensitive data to themselves, while still maintaining confidence in a connected record of provenance.",
  "The zk-SNARK provides a way for a party to prove the accuracy or existence of one piece of data without actually revealing it.",
  "The problem is that even permissioned blockchains allow all node operators to access data stored on nodes within the network.",
  "In the finance world, zero-knowledge proofs are being used to help protect the identities of cryptocurrency transactions.",
  "Many people don’t realize that Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies expose every user’s payment history on blockchain.",
  "For example, individuals could use zk-SNARK proofs to prove their bank accounts hold a certain amount of money.",
  "So, if multiple companies join one blockchain network, each of them can access all the data in the network.",
  "The age itself is not revealed, only the answer to whether or not the man meets the age requirement.",
  "And the first zero-knowledge succinct argument was constructed in a paper by Joe Killian from 1992.",
  "Financial information, passwords, identities or inventory information—it all has to be protected.",
  "You only need to look at China’s new reputation score to see an unsettling notion coming to life.",
  "Would a business want its clients to be able to look up exactly how much each client is charged?",
  "There are dystopian shades to some of the uses for blockchain and other emerging technologies.",
  "For example, let’s say a man wants to visit a bar, but he doesn’t want to reveal his age.",
  "Their work may contain vital business intelligence or data they don’t want others to see.",
  "Its Zerocash protocol protects the identity of the payer, the recipient, and the amount.",
  "The digital currency Zcash is using zero-knowledge proofs to solve this problem.",
  "And zk-SNARKs are a valuable weapon in the battle for privacy and security.",
  "But the proofs wouldn’t reveal the exact amount of money in the accounts.",
  "But modern constructions of zk-SNARKs did not arise until decades later.",
  "Which means anyone can look up the information surrounding a payment.",
  "The bouncer needs to know he is 21 years old to comply with the law.",
  "But in the real world, people often don’t want to show their work.",
  "Only that they did—or did not—meet a certain monetary threshold.",
  "zk-SNARKs provide an elegant solution to this problem.",
  "And zk-SNARKs are helping to do just that.",
  "Data privacy has been a hot topic lately.",
  "zk-SNARKs have extensive uses today.",
  "Obviously, that’s a problem.",
  "Where did they come from?",
  "How do they work?"
