  "But, you know, ten years ago it was funny to see this week, you know, Peter King, who was -- has been described by \"The New York Times\" as the Patriot Act's number one fan, just, you know, raking James Comey over the coals and criticizing the FBI, at the same time that Adam Schiff, who ten years ago was calling for dramatic increase in transparency on the part of FISA, on the opposite side of this issue and saying that the release of this memo was incredibly irresponsible.",
  "When it did, in reading it, Democrats said that the content actually undercut some of the argument that you're making here, because it confirms that the Russia probe was already under way in advance of these FISA warrant applications, and that it pointed all the way back to July 2016, when George Papadopoulos was named there, a former Trump foreign policy aide who has since pled guilty and is now a cooperating witness in the special counsel's probe.",
  "The news cycle in Washington has been dominated this week by a four-page memo written by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee asserting that the FBI concealed that it had used anti-Trump research funded by Democrats when it obtained a secret warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, or FISA, court, to monitor a Trump campaign associate named Carter Page.",
  "BOUIE: What's clear is that some of the people who want the job are energized Democrats, are an unprecedented number of women candidates, an unprecedented number of candidates of color who are coming forward to run in place where Democrats have sort of not been running competitively in order to attempt to strike a blow against the Trump administration.",
  "I think that you're seeing Democrats, who really looked to the last shutdown deadline as an opportunity to push forward on immigration, to try to make a deal on DACA, recognizing that even though their base is energized by that, strategically they don't have a lot of leverage on Capitol Hill right now to tie these issues together.",
  "I found him to be a professional witness, even though I disagree with some of the decisions he made\n\nAnd I think we got to get to the -- some point in life where you can disagree with the decision-making process that someone engaged in without believing that they are corrupt or somehow part of the deep state, whatever that means.",
  "But part of it, too, I think, is just that this political upheaval that we've gone through in the past couple of years is challenging a number of figures who don't really know how to navigate the new scenarios and, frankly, are worried about primary challenges from more populous Republicans who might come in and go after them.",
  "And then the third is, it undermines intelligence collection, because if you're a source of the United States or a foreign government giving us information, you're going to think twice about doing that if it's going to end up...\n\nBRENNAN: Mike, we're going to have to continue that thought on the other side of this break.",
  "You know, that Ken Burns documentary that came out in the fall, I watched it after, you know, spending five, ten years on this book and it really made me sad because there's so much repetition of the pattern in Vietnam, fighting for honor and failing to let the facts guide where the war is really going.",
  "This -- what's most important is that we investigate what happened in the past, but even more importantly that we work together, the House, the Senate Intelligence Committees, the executive branch, the -- our technology companies, to deter future Russian efforts to influence U.S. politics and election.",
  "So, what I would say to the FBI and DOJ is, if you had enough on Carter Page with just him, why did you include something that \"The National Enquirer\" might not run, and why did you cite newspaper article, when there's no court in America that allows a newspaper article to be considered as evidence?",
  "When you look at the Trump administration's policy so far on Russia, it's surprised some that it's been harder line in terms of promising weapons to Ukraine, perhaps more nuclear development in this latest gesture towards countering Russia's nuclear development and breaking some of our treaties.",
  "But it's also kind of a story about what we're going to see in the coming years, which is a continued amount of tension between this Congress and the White House on a number of different fronts because of the differences between the political constituencies that back these different figures.",
  "I wish that they were equally concerned about what's not in the FISA application, which is a lot of really important information about the source and his sub-sources and the fact that he was hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and the fact that he was biased against President Trump.",
  "BOUIE: My hunch -- so, if you pull back, the administration's immigration policy has been less about sort of mass deportation, which just isn't feasible, but more about kind of creating the fear of deportation for newer and larger groups of undocumented immigrants.",
  "One of the more interesting developments, frankly, this past week was the -- the sort of story thrown out there by those close to Mitch McConnell that one Republican who is coming back, it seems, Mitt Romney, would be potentially a candidate to run the NRSC.",
  "BRENNAN: Now, we should dig into this, because you are, from my understanding, the only Republican investigator on the House Intelligence Committee who actually viewed the FISA applications, everything that went into essentially putting together this memo.",
  "And I think that this is only the beginning of a back and forth that is going to result in a lot of questions being raised about a FISA court process that has been frankly controversial for quite some time and now --\n\nBRENNAN: But it was just reauthorized.",
  "BRENNAN: Well, the FBI was gravely concerned that there was information missing from this memo, that it actually was dangerous in setting a precedent in terms of disclosing classified information, and it could actually hurt future intelligence efforts.",
  "COLL: Well, it's been a rough couple of years and there's -- there are groups based in Pakistan, the Haqqani network and others, that have continually carried out mass casualty attacks in Kabul in order to unsettle the government, make themselves felt.",
  "I will tell you, though, Margaret, that during the Ukraine cries in 2014-15, Chris Steele had a number of commercial clients who were asking him for reports on what was going on in Russia, what was going on in Ukraine, what was going on between them.",
  "So you have -- have hundreds of thousands of people right now who are currently in this system, who have received these protection, who have come forward, hundreds of thousands more who do -- chose not to come forward but could if Congress acted.",
  "Yes, I think it's very important that we now have the national security advisor, the secretary of state, the head of the CIA, the secretary of defense all saying that Russia is a real problem and that we need to contain and deter.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL, CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: So, when -- when source provide our government with sensitive information, or foreign governments provide us with sensitive information, they expect us to protect it.",
  "And given that the sort of immigration policy drivers within the administration want this, have no problem with this, I find it hard to imagine that the president will be that broken up if Congress can't get them to adopt a deal.",
  "Manchin recently announced that he will run for re-election, to the great relief of the Democratic caucus, because he is seen as basically only Democrat who stands any kind of chance at keeping the Senate seat in West Virginia.",
  "In the French election, the Macron campaign immediately exposed what Russia was doing to their public, to their media and that sunshine served as a disinfectant and blunted the Russian's ability to influence that election.",
  "There are three Republicans that have seen every bit of information, three of us, Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary, Johnny Ratcliffe, who was a former terrorism prosecutor and a U.S. attorney in Texas, and me.",
  "MARGARET BRENNAN, HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: President Trump declassifies a secret congressional memo that he says clears him in the Russia investigation, but the FBI warns the release has damaged national security.",
  "Congress is looking in to what Russia did in 2016, but, oh, by the way, it's also -- you can do that and also be critical of the use of the dossier and the failure to tell the FISA court of all relevant material facts.",
  "But it's time for me to -- whatever time I got left, I want to spend it in the justice system, because that's where my heart is, and that's where my interest...\n\nBRENNAN: Why do you say you're a lousy politician?",
  "But, of course, Pakistan has also been a partner in counterterrorism over the last 10 years and -- and has carried out arrest of important al Qaeda leaders, even while suckering the Taliban's revival.",
  "And, again, I have differences with the way that they discharge their responsibilities, but there is a wide gulf between me having differences from somebody and think that they should lose their job.",
  "You remember that there were, at the beginning of 2017, lots of noise out of the administration about lifting the Ukraine sanction before we even got into a negotiation and without any leverage.",
  "BRENNAN: So what does that mean for the more than 1.5 million so-called dreamers that the president has now said he'd be willing to give some sort of protection to in a future immigration deal?",
  "To do the kinds of very message controlled and ceremonial things that the president often doesn't do, and -- and to send the signals of calm and normality that the president often doesn't do.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRENNAN: We sat down with the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who has seen all of the classified documents used in the memo, South Carolina's Trey Gowdy.",
  "Government agencies are not going to want to share sensitive information with Congress if they believe that Congress can release it on their own, without going through the redaction process.",
  "And, frankly, if every member of the campaign who the Russians tried to approach and tried to influence had gone to the FBI as well in real time, we might not be in the mess we're in today.",
  "And when they see that information being released, when they see the names of source in documents being released, it gives them pause about whether they should continue to do that or not.",
  "BRENNAN: And the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, if the president makes any move to dismiss him -- he failed to express confidence in him the other day -- would that concern you?",
  "It is -- if those candidates end up succeeding, it will represent a major change in the competition of Congress and a change in -- where the energy in the Democratic Party is coming from.",
  "Because he is taking this evidence as he's saying, you know, clearing the decks and saying that, in the court of public opinion, he should already be decided as not guilty of collusion.",
  "But when it comes to the Department of Justice and the FBI now that the president is raising questions about, these individuals were hand-picked by -- by him, and he's critical of them.",
  "So, when you're talking about this Steele memo, you are not saying that it was the sole piece of evidence used to justify these four authorizations of the surveillance warrant, are you?",
  "I hope it is a one-off that Congress takes this position, but I also hope it's a one-off that a FISA application contains errors and product that is funded by a political opponent.",
  "BRENNAN: Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general that you referenced there, is also publicly disclosed in this memo as someone who helped sign off on this surveillance warrant.",
  "The Republican memo also confirmed that the FBI investigation had begun in the summer of 2016 based on information about another Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos.",
  "GOWDY: I don't think there's a bigger supporter of the FBI in Congress than me and those of us who worked with them in a previous life\n\nI have tremendous respect for the bureau.",
  "NULAND: It's going to take presidential leadership for us to unite this government and create a real strategy, carrots and sticks, to get back on a -- a better path with Russia.",
  "What should have happened here is that this be part of a final report of the committee, with the facts laid out, here's what Republicans think, here's what the Democrats think.",
  "I think the other really important point here, Margaret, is that what happened here underscores the partisanship and the dysfunction of a very important committee in Congress.",
  "And that's what lead to a lot of the questions around this investigation, when the president often has a chance to look tough on Russia, to take some tough action, he doesn't.",
  "But the surveillance itself of this American Carter Page, who was named in your memo, who was at one point a Trump campaign associate, was that justified, that surveillance?",
  "BRENNAN: And from your perspective, the fact that Carter Page has been surveyed going all the way back to 2013 was enough to justify use of this dossier in the application?",
  "FRAN TOWNSEND, CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: It's actually a quite robust process with many checks and balances along the way, including internally in the FBI.",
  "BRENNAN: I want to ask you about one of the criticisms that is coming from Democrats here, because they -- there was lot of hubbub, should the memo come out, should it not?",
  "DOMENECH: Yes, but I think that's going to come up again in terms of questions that people have about that process and what people knew about what was going on behind it.",
  "But I do want to circle back to your prior panel because you had a couple of people on there who are willing to defend the intelligence community, hook, line and sinker.",
  "BRENNAN: And, Fran, there's also this question, which is why I asked you, should Americans be concern of undermining U.S. institution, a lack of trust now for the FBI.",
  "Judges can't then go research and say, well, gosh, I wonder if Chris Steele knew this all himself, or I wonder if he was relying on hearsay from sub-sources in Russia?",
  "BRENNAN: Should all the information in the FISA application be publicly disclosed, declassified, so that people can make their own judgment and see what you have seen?",
  "COLL: And -- and the -- the American people have supported this war more than they did in Vietnam and so that's allowed governments, one after another, to continue it.",
  "There's some speculation in Afghanistan that maybe the terrible attacks we've seen recently are retaliation for that, a kind of signaling (ph), but it's hard to say.",
  "DOMENECH: I think that -- I think that Jamelle is correct when he says that the simplest explanation is that Congress just isn't a very fun place to work these days.",
  "After 2001, as we tried to restore constitutional democracy to Afghanistan, ISI fostered the revival of the Taliban and ended up creating the mess that we're in now.",
  "We sat down earlier with South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, a key House Intelligence investigator, and asked him if he thought the president had been vindicated.",
  "It was the Congress that insisted that they stay in place and be used to try to negotiate the Russians out of Ukraine, which is what they were put on to begin with.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBRENNAN: If you can't watch us live, FACE THE NATION is replayed on our digital network, CBSN, every Sunday at 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern.",
  "GOWDY: Well, I'm actually in a really small group, I think, of Republicans that think that this FISA process is suspect and wrong and should not have taken place.",
  "But this is -- these are thousands of people who've devoted decades to public service, to protecting us from this sort of influence, for -- to investigating it.",
  "BRENNAN: So, Presidents Bush, Obama, now Trump, have all wanted to draw down and then realize they needed to recommit, they thought, to this war in Afghanistan.",
  "Even though it gets tied up in all the politics, there are real people who lived in this country for quite some time who don't know if they'll be able to stay.",
  "But if you were going to include it, they did the right thing by caveating it in the footnote, even if Trey Gowdy disagrees with how detailed the footnote was.",
  "BRENNAN: One thing that we have seen on the part of Congress, widespread support for, were sanctions on Russia and the president didn't act on this this week.",
  "It doesn't tend to work and the reaction to the latest pressure has just been another kind of response of deep nationalism and defiance of the United States.",
  "So I do fear that the latest turn in policy is really not much of a departure from what the Bush administration and the Obama administration struggled with.",
  "He's recognizing that Romney is one of the few Republicans, perhaps the only one who could challenge him for leadership should that sort of situation arise.",
  "I mean ISI has a record of carrying out mass casualty attacks to -- in order to send a signal about where the war is going and -- and their interest in it.",
  "NULAND: The dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding and our immediate reaction to that was, this is not in our purview.",
  "BRENNAN: Now, your committee, the House Intelligence Committee, has said they have a second memo planned for release, this time about the State Department.",
  "If there are sources and methods that are not already known that they think would jeopardize national security, I would -- I would defer to their judgment.",
  "And there are multiple legal checks, including, let's remember, these -- these packages for the FISA surveillance went to independent Article III judges.",
  "And so I think that that story, which is developing and ongoing, is one reason to be -- have an eye on this November beyond all the other machinations.",
  "But I think the overall conclusion you have to draw from what's happened in Congress over the last year or so is that, who wouldn't want to be there?",
  "This need to go to the FBI if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian Federation.",
  "And my -- you know, in the absence of any sort of deal on immigration, my hunch is that the administration will continue forward with this approach.",
  "And so we, for example, we often say of the general that go over and lead the war, we'll say, we can't find a military solution against the Taliban.",
  "Carter Page, if you wanted to do surveillance on him, you had to had probable cause that he was an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia.",
  "We disagree on this issue, but I don't question their love for the country, and I don't -- I just -- I don't think the end justifies the means.",
  "And so these public servants, what they care about is getting to the bottom and getting the facts without -- without fear or favor of politics.",
  "And so they're the ones who put this out there that ended up, you know, being seized on by the president, really overshadowing everything else.",
  "And so I do think the State of the Union was important and it matters that it was generally seen as -- as a good performance by the president.",
  "Every time they came back to the court, they had to show it was productive and they were learning more about his activities vis-a-vis Russia.",
  "I say investigate everything Russia did, but admit that this was a really sloppy process that you have engaged in to surveil a U.S. citizen.",
  "It took longer to explain it the way they did than if they had just come right out and said Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, and much worse than that.",
  "He was unusually aggressive, sort of picking a fight with Joe Manchin, a senator that the administration has tried to work with in the past.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRENNAN: Does he still have confidence in his own deputy attorney, Rod Rosenstein, who helped signed off on the request?",
  "And it's -- it's a -- a real shame for the president and his supporters because the reviews of the State of the Union were quite positive.",
  "But this herky-jerky news cycle that we've been in for seemingly the past three years just means that nothing makes a lasting impression.",
  "One, I think the country is paying a lot of attention to the economic news that they've had over the course of the past couple of months.",
  "Bob Mueller is looking into what Russia did in 2016 and potential criminality, as evidenced by the Papadopoulos plea and the Flynn plea.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nREP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I actually don't think it has any impact on the Russia probe, for this reason.",
  "The anti-Trump research, also called the Steele dossier, was originally put together by a former British spy named Christopher Steele.",
  "So, to the extent the memo deals with the dossier and the FISA process, the dossier has nothing to do with the meeting in Trump Tower.",
  "GOWDY: I would argue it's also somewhat unprecedented to rely on political opposition research to instruct and inform an application.",
  "The Amtrak train was heading south from New York bound for Miami when, around 2:30 this morning, it collided with that freight train.",
  "Then the Justice Department and FBI had to come back to the court, and they had to not only plead that he was agent of foreign power.",
  "That being said, Congress, you know, can move fast when it wants to and particularly slow when they get into these gridlock moments.",
  "I think it is fair to ask, what FISA reforms are you going to implement to make sure we don't have this fact pattern come up again?",
  "The Republican memo accuses the FBI of abusing their powers to spy on a Trump campaign adviser suspected of being a Russian agent.",
  "I have real questions about the process that the bureau went through in 2016, but I also think he's the person to lead the bureau.",
  "It included reference to a newspaper article which, by the way, no court in America considers a newspaper article to be evidence.",
  "TOWNSEND: Well, look, I -- I think you can take the dossier -- based on what we know, I think you can take the dossier out of it.",
  "The CIA worked with them during the 1980s to smuggle guns and money to the Afghan rebels who were fighting the Soviet occupation.",
  "And that is not -- look, in the courtroom, there's a reason we throw out search warrants even though we found the murder weapon.",
  "BRENNAN: So, your concern is a process-driven one, not questioning the probe that the president continues to call a witch-hunt?",
  "BRENNAN: What's happening right now, you've seen some really terrible terrorist attacks over the past two weeks in Afghanistan.",
  "BRENNAN: I want to ask you, Molly, about some of the -- some of the noise coming out of the vice president's office these days.",
  "And there is -- we do have concerns with a certain aspect of State Department involvement, and have serious concerns about it.",
  "JAMELLE BOUIE, \"SLATE\" MAGAZINE: Yes, during your interview with Congressman Gowdy, you asked him why he was leaving Congress.",
  "And there's breaking news as well this morning, as an Amtrak passenger train collides with a freight train in South Carolina.",
  "BRENNAN: Ben, when you come and look at the numbers right now, as we're saying, you know, they need a few friendly Democrats.",
  "And I think that that is actually some -- a story that is just beginning in terms of the consequence of this memo's release.",
  "You know, this is part of the frustration that you hear from Americans, but also, frankly, from a lot of members right now.",
  "I don't judge people based on a single decision that they make throughout the course of an otherwise really stellar career.",
  "There was plenty of information to establish probable cause about the possibility of him being an agent of a foreign power.",
  "We finally have the White House and we're incapable of delivering on any of the things that we promise to our constituents.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our national security panel.",
  "Fran Townsend was homeland security adviser to George W. Bush, and she is now a CBS News senior national security analyst.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: You surprised Washington with announcing your retirement, that you're not going to run for Congress.",
  "My wife hates it when I say this, but I was a pretty good prosecutor, I think, but I have been a pretty lousy politician.",
  "And that does not serve Congress well, it doesn't serve the intelligence community and it doesn't serve the country well.",
  "And when we fight with each other, when we question our fundamental institution, that is a great day for Vladimir Putin.",
  "I think it is fair to ask the deputy attorney general, what did you know at the time you signed one of the applications?",
  "BRENNAN: Speaker Ryan says that the memo that you helped put together here does not threaten the credibility of the FBI.",
  "But it's also possible that these are just terrorist attacks of the type we've been seeing too often over the last year.",
  "I think you would have a Russia -- look, Russia tried to interfere with our election in 2016 with or without a dossier.",
  "Chris had a friend at the State Department and he offered us that reporting free so that we could also benefit from it.",
  "But the judges often ask for additional information, especially in the -- in the case where the dossier was foot noted.",
  "We'll continue our conversation now with national security panelist Fran Townsend, Michael Morell and Victoria Nuland.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL, CBS NEWS SENIOR SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: So, I think there's kind of two points to set this up, Margaret.",
  "Now, initial reports are most of the injuries are not life-threatening, ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBRENNAN: We turn now to a trio of experts to help us understand the impact of the memo's release.",
  "And one of the consequence of that is other countries are now getting into this business of weaponizing social media.",
  "Authorities are reporting 116 patients, including at least two children, were brought to the hospital for treatment.",
  "The first is, it undermines the credibility of the FBI in the public's eyes, and with no justification, in my view.",
  "So, part of the reason that this debate, I think, is so fraught is because we're talking about real people's lives.",
  "You need an investigation into Trump Tower and the Cambridge Analytica e-mail separate and apart from the dossier.",
  "The fact is that we're talking about, you know, not the whole of the FBI or the intelligence community, obviously.",
  "BRENNAN: But short of that disclosure, you still would have believed this FISA surveillance warrant was justified?",
  "And I still think that he's fully capable of helping run a Justice Department that we can all have confidence in.",
  "Not knowing what you believe and not caring enough about it to fight for it, that's the worst thing in the world.",
  "I think it was David Petraeus who said you can't capture and kill your way out of industrial strength insurgency.",
  "Just for the past -- for the past year and a half it has been difficult to move forward on anything in Congress.",
  "You know, you may disagree, as Trey Gowdy says, with a particular decision Rod Rosenstein or Andrew McCabe made.",

  "It's why you've seen Republicans advantage in -- in the election improve compared to where it was in December.",
  "Then, in the middle of July, when he was doing this other work and became concerned --\n\nBRENNAN: The dossier.",
  "BRENNAN: When it comes to this memo, Senator John McCain said that it only serves Vladimir Putin's interest.",
  "BRENNAN: Now the president tweeted that he was going to be doing something about the aid you just mentioned.",
  "I was just there in December with the vice president who said we're going to stay until the last terrorist.",
  "PACE: You have a March 5th deadline, but that also some questions about --\n\nBRENNAN: Is that going to stay?",
  "GOWDY: Well, I think the folks that he picked, Chris Wray and Rod Rosenstein, can effectuate those changes.",
  "Saturday, President Trump tweeted that the memo -- quote -- \"totally vindicated\" Trump in the Russia probe.",
  "So, I don't -- look, I will never miss chance to blame judges, if I can, because I was a former litigator.",
  "The FBI was aware in 2013 he had been approached by Russian intelligence agents, and they interviewed him.",
  "Being quiet about things, that it might be advantageous for him not to talk about is not his strong suit.",
  "And it's really bad precedent and unprecedented to not tell a court that a source has this level of bias.",
  "And, you know, Pence's strategy for the most part as vice president has been to act presidential, right?",
  "BRENNAN: Jamelle, are we getting ahead of ourselves in trying to read ahead to what's happening in 2018?",
  "We haven't been able to align our resource and capabilities with the goals that we're trying to achieve.",
  "And so we keep prioritizing military action, even as we acknowledge that it's not likely to end the war.",
  "So, we have all three of those things in common, including being concerned about what happened in 2016.",
  "It was one of, you know, hundreds of sources that we were using to try to understand what was going on.",
  "But I think we have seen that the president, in particular, message discipline is not his strong suit.",
  "BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, I think in this case, there are two different messages going on.",
  "JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": It doesn't feel like there's an appetite for a shutdown this week.",
  "GOWDY: I think -- I'm going to defer a little bit to the bureau and DOJ on -- it's a long application.",
  "But it also doesn't mean Congress is not legitimate in asking these questions, because I think we are.",
  "Similarly, you know, the president's approval rating has picked up in a number of different measures.",
  "Oftentimes they're -- they're legally prohibit from political activity and none of them engage in it.",
  "In, you know, in -- there's a history of imposing sanctions on Pakistan to try to change its conduct.",

  "And I say that even though we're totally opposite sides of this issue and probably will always be.",
  "He has since pled guilty and is cooperating with the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "And the fact that someone disagrees with me does not make me challenge their love of the country.",
  "It really is about the facts of the investigation that drive them to protect the American people.",
  "FRAN TOWNSEND, CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Look, these are career public servants.",
  "BRENNAN: And you see widespread support for that kind of criticism within the Republican Party?",
  "His new book is \"Directorate S: The CIA and America's Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"",
  "I -- we're not through with the investigation, so I'm not going to prejudge the outcome of it.",
  "GOWDY: But it's both the Steele dossier and who paid for it and whether or not it was vetted.",
  "GOWDY: I think what -- I think what Devin said is, there's a phase two of the investigation.",
  "And we ought to be looking at doing that as soon as the Russian elections are over in March.",
  "NULAND: Well, I think in the first instance, our democracy is working with regard to Russia.",
  "Does he have clearer eyes than past presidents who have been more careful in their language?",
  "BRENNAN: Victoria, Congressman Gowdy said they now have concern about the State Department.",
  "And you see a lot of people criticizing the FBI, who have been its most stalwart defenders.",
