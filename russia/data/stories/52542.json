  "“In this new business model, attackers are no longer penalizing victims for opening an attachment, or running a malicious script by taking systems hostage and demanding a ransom,” explain Nick Biasini, Outreach Engineer; Edmund Brumaghin, Threat Researcher; Warren Mercer, Technical Leader; Josh Reynolds, Information Security Analyst; Azim Khodijbaev, Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst; and David Liebenberg, Senior Threat Analyst; all at the Cisco Systems Talos threat intelligence division (the ‘Talos team’).",
  "Due to a combination of a leaked NSA hack, a cryptocurrency more anonymous than Bitcoin, and benign cryptocurrency transaction processing (aka ‘mining’) software that requires no command and control link back to the attacker, we now have the perfect combination of easy money, slim chance of detection, and billions of unsuspecting targets that may not even care they’ve been hacked.",
  "“What we’re looking at from a near and potentially long-term perspective is the value of a computer that has just a regular old CPU might be more just leaving it quietly running some cryptocurrency miner rather than infecting it with ransomware or some other software that might steal data,” explains Ryan Olson, Intelligence Director at Palo Alto Networks.",
  "“Given the significant profits available to the botnet operators and the resilience of the botnet and its infrastructure, we expect these activities to continue, along with their potential impacts on infected nodes.”\n\nSmominru leverages the EternalBlue exploit from the NSA which targets Windows Management Infrastructure (WMI).",
  "“There is no need to attempt to compromise hosts to steal documents, passwords, wallets, private keys, as we’ve grown accustomed to seeing from financially motivated attackers.”\n\nFlying Under the Radar\n\nContrasted with the business-sinking direct assault of ransomware, illicit cryptomining is downright benign.",
  "“Bitcoin alternatives like Monero and Ethereum continue their overall upward trend in value,” Oliver continues, “putting them squarely in the crosshairs of threat actors looking for quick profits and anonymous transactions.”\n\nWhile other cryptocurrencies play a factor, Monero is shaping up to be the favorite.",
  "“There isn’t any command and control activity and it generates revenue consistently until its removed.”\n\nCommand and control is a term for how hackers must ‘phone home’ once they find their target in order to exfiltrate the goods – a step that is no longer necessary in the case of illicit cryptomining.",
  "“The increase in purchasing power and liquidity is driving valuations, as well as volatility, higher than ever before,” say Ryan McCombs, Senior Consultant; Jason Barnes, Senior Consultant; Karan Sood, Senior Security Researcher; and Ian Barton, Consultant; all at CrowdStrike (the ‘CrowdStrike team’).",
  "“While cryptocurrency mining has typically been viewed as a nuisance, CrowdStrike has recently seen several cases where mining has impacted business operations,” the CrowdStrike team adds, “rendering some companies unable to operate for days and weeks at a time.”\n\nProofpoint agrees.",
  "Building a Botnet\n\nLarge numbers of compromised systems working in concert known as botnets are a common hacker tool, as they can mount distributed denial of service attacks and various other attacks that require massive amounts of coordinated transaction processing.",
  "“Proofpoint researchers have been tracking the massive Smominru botnet, the combined computing power of which has earned millions of dollars for its operators,” explains Sandiford Oliver, Cybersecurity Researcher for Proofpoint, who goes by the pseudonym Kafeine.",
  "“We repeatedly see threat actors ‘follow the money’ - over the last several months, the money has been in cryptocurrency and actors are turning their attention to a variety of illicit means to obtain both Bitcoins and alternatives.”\n\nOliver seconds this point.",
  "The third component of his nefarious enterprise: the fact that all blockchain-based systems leverage distributed transaction processors known as miners, who automatically receive a payment for their efforts in whatever cryptocurrency they choose to process.",
  "“As Bitcoin has become prohibitively resource-intensive to mine outside of dedicated mining farms, interest in Monero has increased dramatically.”\n\nThe combination of simple botnets and anonymous cryptocurrency has led to an explosion of illicit activity.",
  "“Because most of the nodes in this botnet appear to be Windows servers, the performance impact on potentially critical business infrastructure may be high, as can the cost of increased energy usage by servers running much closer to capacity,” Oliver says.",
  "At that point, expect to see widespread ‘brownouts’ of computing power, as large swaths of the global computing infrastructure collapse under the weight of multiple botnets, each building the respective fortunes of criminal enterprises around the globe.",
  "“Its fileless nature and use of legitimate system software such as WMI and PowerShell make it difficult, if not impossible, for organizations to block it without some form of next-generation antivirus.”\n\nWMI, however, isn’t the only vulnerability.",
  "“Naturally, where there are profits to be had, crime is not far behind.”\n\nAs a result, illicit cryptomining is rapidly replacing ransomware as the attack vector of choice, especially as cybersecurity vendors bring ransomware protection to market.",
  "Assembling the Pieces of the ‘Perfect Crime’\n\nIn early 2017, a hacker group released into the wild a number of NSA-created hacks including EternalBlue, which made it dead simple to crack open Microsoft Windows.",
  "“Talos has observed botnets consisting of millions of infected systems, which…means that these systems could be leveraged to generate more than $100 million per year theoretically,” the Talos team continues.",
  "Some researchers report attacks via Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle WebLogic, and just last month, an attack vector that targets Google Android devices by scanning for open debug ports has come on the scene.",
  "“So theoretically, the victims could remain part of the adversary’s botnet for as long as the attacker chooses.”\n\nHowever, stealing computing power (and its requisite electricity) isn’t entirely benign.",
  "More importantly, with little chance of being detected, this revenue stream can continue in perpetuity.”\n\nThere are, in fact, several different exploits that lead to different families of botnets.",
  "Once the target downloads the file, it runs a Word macro that executes a Visual Basic script that in turn runs a Microsoft PowerShell script that downloads and installs the miner executable.",
  "“Now attackers are actively leveraging the resources of infected systems for cryptocurrency mining.”\n\nThis attack vector is both profitable and easy to mount – a dangerous combination.",
  "Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.",
  "“This Monero mining botnet is extremely large, made up mostly of Microsoft Windows servers spread around the globe,” says Kevin Epstein, VP of Proofpoint’s Threat Operations Center.",
  "The Future of Illicit Cryptomining\n\nWhile the fact that this cyberattack flies under the radar may seem benign, it’s actually the reason why this attack strategy is so dangerous.",
  "Unlike ransomware, where businesses demand rapid mitigation technology from software vendors, with illicit cryptomining, the attacks will be able to spread mostly unchecked.",
  "Meanwhile, cryptocurrency advocates unhappy with Bitcoin’s lack of true anonymity developed Monero, an altcoin better able to hide the tracks of criminal transactions.",
  "All of them making money for the bad guys every minute, day and night – any bad guys, really, but most noticeably Russian and Chinese organized crime syndicates.",
  "“Attackers are not stealing anything more than computing power from their victims, and the mining software isn’t technically malware,” the Talos team continues.",
  "The global hacker community just invented gunpowder: the ability to surreptitiously install illicit Monero miners on unsuspecting computers around the world.",
  "“CrowdStrike has observed more sophisticated capabilities built into a cryptomining worm dubbed WannaMine,” says the CrowdStrike team.",
  "At some point, criminals will increasingly step on each other’s toes, with multiple bad actors attempting to infect the same systems.",
  "“In the last year, we have observed standalone coin miners and coin mining modules in existing malware proliferate rapidly,” he says.",
  "This problem is so pernicious, in fact, that software mitigation techniques may turn out to be insufficient to stop its spread.",
  "Unraveling the Threat\n\nThe most pernicious aspect of illicit cryptomining is how well it flies under the radar of its victims.",
  "“Cryptocurrency miner payloads could be among some of the easiest money makers available for attackers,” the Talos team adds.",
  "Over time, we can thus expect compromised systems churning away at making money for criminals to reach epidemic proportions.",
  "Show Me the Money\n\nThe linchpin that holds the entire nefarious enterprise together is the anonymous cryptocurrency Monero.",
  "And you may have no idea you’ve been hacked, other than occasional performance slowdowns and higher electric bills.",
  "Criminals simply need to install many miners because each miner only generates a relatively small amount of money.",
  "Criminals around the world are rejoicing, still incredulous at how easy it is to make money while they sleep.",
  "The miner software must simply have the anonymized code representing the attacker’s cryptowallet.",
  "In the case of illicit cryptomining, however, each node works independently of the others.",
  "Instead, governments may simply have to pull the plug on cryptocurrency once and for all.",
  "Today, all the smart hackers have turned to illicit cryptomining to fill their coffers.",
  "The attacker typically mounts a phishing attack with a Microsoft Word file attachment.",
  "None of the other organizations mentioned in this article are Intellyx customers.",
  "Another popular cryptomining worm that leverages WMI weaknesses is WannaMine.",
  "“It’s largely unnoticed by the majority of users,” the Talos team says.",
  "“This is all done with minimal effort following the initial infection.",
  "You may not even be able to convince anybody there’s a problem.",
  "As of the time of writing, Microsoft is an Intellyx customer.",
  "Perhaps the most pernicious has been dubbed Smominru.",
  "No stolen files of passwords or credit card numbers.",
  "Sulfur – saltpeter – charcoal – and bam!",
  "What, then, is actually being stolen?",
  "Image credit: public domain.",
  "Ransomware is oh, so 2017.",
  "Even IoT endpoints.",
  "Criminals love it.",
  "Windows servers.",
  "Android devices.",
  "No ransom notes.",
  "Guess what?",
  "Laptops."
