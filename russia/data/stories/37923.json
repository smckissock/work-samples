  "Tepper, who owns Caesars junior debt, saw his bond recovery nearly double in value this month after the company's owners, TPG Capital and Apollo Global Management, ceded a majority of their equity from the $30 billion LBO deal to bondholders in exchange for a release from future litigation.",
  "\"Under the terms of the global deal, the sponsors ultimately had to relinquish their entire CEC ownership stake to obtain releases, giving an estimated $950 million in equity value to second lien creditors,\" said Sarah Gefter, a senior analyst at Reorg Research.",
  "\"The Revised Plan of Reorganization will release all pending and potential litigation claims and causes of action against Caesars Entertainment, Caesars Acquisition Company, and related third parties to the fullest extent permitted,\" Caesars said on Tuesday.",
  "David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management, is poised to gain the most from Caesars Entertainment's new bankruptcy plan as the gaming giant completes a multi-year restructuring after a disastrous bubble-era leveraged buyout.",
  "Alongside the sponsors, first lien creditors and the subsidiary guaranteed noteholders also gave up value to second lien creditors, bridging the gap and finally bringing the seconds on board with a global resolution,\" Gefter added.",
  "This equity is valued at about $950 million and is now leading to a 66-cent on the dollar recovery for second lien noteholders like Tepper, versus a previous deal where holders would have received 39-cents on the dollar.",
  "'Caesars' first lien bank lenders will receive 115-cents on the dollar, a decline of approximately 1-cent from the previous plan, while first lien noteholders recoveries will remain at 109-cents on the dollar.",
  "It also appears Tuesday's deal will forestall discovery regarding the personal wealth of billionaires Marc Rowan (Apollo) and David Bonderman (TPG) that was looming in the litigation.",
  "Litigation led by Tepper and Oaktree Capital threatened to create newfound liabilities for Apollo, TPG and its prominent partners, hastening a favorable settlement for bondholders.",
  "The new bankruptcy plan is set to go in front of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Benjamin Goldgar in January and Caesars expects it may be able to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of 2017.",
  "TPG and Apollo will still own some equity in the new company due to a merger between Caesars non-bankrupt units, Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Corporation.",
  "Crucially, the new Caesars bankruptcy plan will release all pending and potential litigation against Caesars and its PE sponsors in exchange for the increased recovery.",
  "Apollo, TPG and co-investors on the buyout deal will give over the 14% of the equity they would have held in Caesars upon its emergence from bankruptcy to bondholders.",
  "The potential bankruptcy settlement ends nearly two years of legal battle after Caesars Entertainment Operating Company filed a $18 billion bankruptcy in January 2015.",
  "Creditors like Tepper have long fought Caesars and its PE-owners on asset transfers after the company fell into distress, arguing that the swaps were a raid on assets.",
  "In exchange for a release from this litigation, some Caesars creditors are seeing their claims rise by nearly $1 billion in value.",
  "Meanwhile Caesars Entertainment's non-PE sponsor equity holders will retain 6% of the equity in the new Caesars.",
  "Caesars Entertainment shares fell 14% in Tuesday trading, while Caesars Acquisition Corporation shares fell 2%.",
  "\"Other creditor groups have also agreed to give up value in the interest of reaching consensus, however.",
  "One creditor, Trilogy Capital Management, remains a holdout in the Caesars bankruptcy case.",
  "Subsidiary guaranteed noteholder recoveries will be approximately 83-cents on the dollar.",
  "Presently, Apollo and TPG own 65% of Caesars acquisition, according to filings.",
  "And the increased recovery is coming mostly from Caesars' PE sponsors.",
  "(TPG and Apollo have long disputed bondholder claims of fraud).",
  "Unsecured creditors will also receive 66-cents on the dollar."
