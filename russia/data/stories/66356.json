  "Manafort does rip out Voloshin’s irrelevant discussion of his insistence on using modern polling and social science techniques—which also implied that Yanukovych’s attempted pivot toward Europe was based on raw political calculation, not conviction—and directs him to focus instead on how Yanukovych had “changed a Soviet based legal economic framework to a western one.” Given how history played out, this is a dubious gambit, but at least Manafort pushes Voloshin to provide specific examples of Yanukovych’s reforms and their apparent speed, and then punches up the payoff line: “This pace shocked Moscow.” (In an email released on Monday, Manfort tells Kilimnik he’s taken out “pieces that would not be good to mention.”)\n\nAnd he makes sure to sharpen the line giving himself credit, while making clear that it wasn’t easy: “Following the European track created multiple challenges that would never had been solved by a Ukrainian Government except for the consistent promotion of what had to be done by Paul Manafort.” (Though he adds another split compound verb, a typo and a needless capitalization of the word “government.”)\n\nCuriously, both Manafort and the Kyiv Post passed up the opportunity to straighten out the mess that serves as Voloshin’s conclusion.",
  "(The Kyiv Post changed Manafort and Voloshin’s proposed headline to “Paul Manafort, European integration’s unknown soldier for Ukraine.”)\n\nNext, he allows a couple of grammatical errors in the lede to slip through—a dropped definite article and a split compound verb: “EU-Ukraine Association Agreement might have never appeared but for a person now falsely accused of lobbying Russian interests.” The folks at the Kyiv Post caught the first mistake, and helpfully spelled out “European Union,” but the bigger issue is that the lede assumes knowledge the reader might not have (what the hell is this agreement and what did it mean?).",
  "“If only one pursues the truth, not ends to twist the reality in line with his or her conviction that the dubious goal of undermining Trump’s presidency, justifies most dishonest means.”\n\nWhat’s shocking about Manafort’s edits, however, is not their lazy, drive-by quality.",
  "Here, he wants to underscore a more substantive point: that by making Brussels, the EU’s administrative capital, his first foreign trip, Manafort’s former client—ex-president Viktor Yanukovych—was signaling that he wanted to orient Ukraine toward the West, not Russia.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nFederal investigators caught wind of Manafort’s communications with his former deputy in Ukraine, Konstantin Kilimnik, and alerted the team working for Special Counsel Bob Mueller, who in turn informed U.S. District Court Judge Amy Jackson.",
  "In its filing to Jackson, Mueller’s team characterized Kilimnik, who was acting as a go-between with Voloshin, as having “ties to a Russian intelligence service,” leading to alarming headlines that made it sound like Manafort was up to some serious skulduggery.",
  "He’s No Russian Stooge.” Or, if that’s too much, go with the tried and true “curiosity gap” approach favored by the best practitioners of Facebook dark arts, which leaves out a crucial piece of information and thus produces an insatiable urge to click.",
  "The other day, I scoffed online at a former Clinton adviser’s worry that by posting Voloshin’s piece, the media were doing Russia’s bidding and “publishing weaponized info.”\n\nIf this sorry op-ed constitutes “weaponized info,” consider me unconcerned.",
  "And if Manafort truly were the evil genius behind a pro-Moscow conspiracy to tilt the U.S. election toward Trump, as some allege, then clearly it doesn’t take a master wordsmith to manipulate the American electorate.",
  "Paul Manafort got a rap on the knuckles on Monday from a federal judge, who ripped the former Trump campaign chief for violating a gag order that bars him from trying to shape public opinion about his case.",
  "The article’s ostensible author was Oleg Voloshin, who flacked for Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs back when it was run by a pro-Russian party that was paying Manafort as a consultant.",
  "“I’m inclined to view such conduct in the future to be an effort to circumvent and evade the requirements of my order as it’s been clarified this morning,” Jackson said.",
  "What the judge should have done is convict Manafort, who over the years has been paid millions for his supposedly savvy political work, of being a lousy editor.",
  "Judge Jackson, in admonishing Manafort to holster his apparently dangerous copy of Microsoft Word, said she worried about “the power of retweeting.”\n\nPlease.",
  "In this case, Voloshin had come up with a real stinker: “European integration unknown soldier.” A bad headline can be fatal even to a good piece of writing.",
  "(It’s fine to offer a good one when you file your draft—just don’t insist on it or editors will consider you gauche and difficult to work with.)",
  "Maybe: “Paul Manafort’s Not-So-Dirty Secret.” Either way, you’re going to want Manafort’s name in the headline for search optimization purposes.",
  "Perhaps recognizing that the offense here is relatively minor, the judge let him go with a warning rather than finding him in contempt of court.",
  "We know this because Mueller’s team published a copy of the edits Manafort made to Voloshin’s draft, and they are decidedly unimpressive.",
  "Typically, authors don’t write their own, but sometimes an editor will accept a suggestion out of sheer inertia or a lack of creativity.",
  "In this age of social media-fueled narcissism, it’s usually best to go with a first-person headline when you have the opportunity.",
  "(Fine—Voloshin is not a native English speaker, and maybe Manafort figured the Kyiv Post’s copy desk would catch the small stuff.)",
  "At issue: Manafort’s shadow editing of an op-ed published last week in an English-language newspaper in Ukraine, the Kyiv Post.",
  "AP Photo Law And Order Paul Manafort’s Dirty Secret: He’s a Terrible Propagandist If bad editing’s a crime, lock him up.",
  "If the aim is to reach an audience beyond English-speaking Ukrainian political insiders, Manafort has already failed.",
  "In reality, Manafort was simply polishing up what reads like a pretty sad effort to sanitize his image.",
  "It’s how, for a supposed expert in manipulating public opinion, this seems to be the best he can do.",
  "In fact, our ghost editor hardly touches Voloshin’s torturous prose until paragraphs four and five.",
  "I might have suggested something a bit more web-friendly, such as, “I Know Paul Manafort.",
  "And since Manafort had recommended the Brussels visit, how could he be a Russian stooge?",
  "We must first indict Manafort for letting Voloshin’s proposed headline stand.",
  "Blake Hounshell is the editor in chief of POLITICO Magazine.",
  "“All listed here facts can be easily verified,” he writes.",
  "Nobody was going to share this 791-word piece of garbage.",
  "Manafort should have proposed his own."
