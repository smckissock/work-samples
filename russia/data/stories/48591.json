  "When details of the secret research leaked to the press, the company’s response was that it had not followed its ethical review process, but that the failure to adhere to its ethical review process was merely a minor “oversight.”\n\nAs I noted at the time, “the company emphasized that it has a strong ethical review process that determines what constitutes allowable research and must issue approval for any internal company research of sensitive nature conducted on its users and that in this case two employees went ahead and used their privileged access to search for the most vulnerable emotional moments of young children without ever submitting their research for review, and the company’s response is that this is not a major breach of research protocol that requires an immediate suspension and review of sensitive research across the company, but rather just a minor 'oversight' not to be worried about.”\n\nMore remarkably, that two Facebook researchers could conduct research on such an extraordinarily sensitive topic on such a vulnerable population and tout that research to advertisers without ever having their work ethically reviewed and, according to the company, without its formal knowledge and approval, suggests Facebook has woefully inadequate central controls over the use of its users’ data by its own researchers.",
  "Put another way, in spite of the outpouring of public criticism and claims that new ethical standards are needed, little actual change ever happens and after a brief period of conversation and consternation, things go back to the way they were.”\n\nIndeed, three years later it appears little did change at Facebook, with the company’s internal researchers becoming embroiled in yet another ethical firestorm regarding psychological profiling when it emerged that they had been conducting secret research on more than 6.4 million Australian youth as young as 14 years old to determine when they were at their most vulnerable, experiencing feelings of being “worthless” or a “failure” in order to better target them for advertisers.",
  "One of the authors was also the lead author of a 2013 PNAS study that demonstrated that Facebook data can be used “to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.”\n\nNot a day goes by that I don’t see a request on an academic mailing list from a university researcher looking to extract a large volume of material from Facebook or announcing a new tool to make bulk extraction of user information from the platform easier.",
  "In short, even the most basic of web searches easily turned up that law enforcement was a client of GeoFeedia’s and this thus raises the question of how Twitter and Facebook never noticed that a high-profile subscriber of their services, especially one that allegedly was signing additional special licensing agreements with Facebook, would never have appeared on their radars.”\n\nOf course, academia has been a massive consumer of social media data as well, employing its wealth of data for all sorts of extraordinarily sensitive and ethically questionable research.",
  "Demonstrating the stark divide between the written ethical policies of academia and what actually happens in practice with social data research, Stanford had previously provided comment to me documenting what was one of the most rigorous ethical review processes at an American university, including specialized privacy reviews and typically requiring a signed legal agreement with data vendors, along with noting explicitly that bulk downloading data from a website in violation of its terms of service was absolutely prohibited.",
  "A central theme of the rhetoric and coverage of Cambridge Analytica is that it somehow violated accepted societal norms over the use of Facebook data, with politicians, regulators and major news outlets referring to it in the cybersecurity parlance of a data “breach.” In fact, this could not be further from the truth in our modern “surveillance economy.”\n\nFacebook and other social media data has, almost from its inception, been a major data source for academic research, with little to no ethical concern for its utilization.",
  "For its part, Facebook modified its terms of service in May 2012 to enshrine its right to conduct research on its users, noting that “companies that want to improve their services use the information their customers provide, whether or not their privacy policy uses the word 'research' or not.” Yet, when asked whether the company would ever consider offering an option for users to opt-out of having their personal data used by Facebook for research, the company never responded.",
  "When the Obama campaign pushed the boundaries of precision voter targeting, pioneering techniques like peering into the privacy of American’s living rooms through their DVRs to see what each individual voter was actually watching on their televisions, the press and public cheered, hailing it as a long overdue modernization of the campaigning process and holding up the campaign’s data scientists as miniature heroes showcasing what could be done with data today.",
  "However, whether or not the allegations are true (the company has denied them), the singular focus on Cambridge Analytica makes for a simple meme-worthy media narrative, but the reality is that what the company stands accused of by Facebook is in fact what academic researchers, commercial enterprises, governments and even the social media companies themselves do every day with the data entrusted to them by a quarter of the earth’s population.",
  "When asked about a study last year that estimated the political leanings of Twitter users in direct violation of the company’s explicit prohibition on political profiling, a company spokesperson confirmed that the research was a clear violation of its policy, that academic research was not in any way exempt from its policy and that the researchers had not received any authorization or permission from Twitter to conduct their research.",
  "Geofeedia is far from a James Bond cloak-and-dagger defense contractor operating in the shadows – it is a widely known commercial company widely and openly touting its capabilities through numerous case studies and receiving considerable media coverage that specifically discussed its law enforcement clients, while the FBI openly issued an RFP for its services as part of its larger interest in social monitoring.",
  "Cambridge Analytica garnered headlines across the world on Friday as Facebook formally suspended the company from its platform over allegations that it had improperly received and retained data on tens of millions of Facebook users from an academic researcher that had originally obtained the data legally and properly in accordance with previous Facebook developer guidelines.",
  "The users gave the app permission to use their data.” In short, the users clicked a button authorizing their data to be used for research, so they knew what they were getting into and that single personality quiz they took between 2007 and 2012 and long forgot about entitles researchers a decade later to continue to use their information for a publication in 2017.",
  "Yet, when I followed up in 2016 about how views had changed towards that kind of research at Facebook, Cornell and PNAS, Facebook declined to release any substantive information about its ethics panel beyond a brief overview nor would it release the protocols it uses to review research or the guidelines it requires its researchers to adhere to.",
  "Combined with Harvard’s failure to respond to multiple requests for comment, this suggests that even in the highest-profile cases involving the nation’s top universities with strong Common Rule-compliant IRB systems and at the most prestigious journals in academia, there are few actual changes made in the aftermath of an ethical firestorm.",
  "Much as Cambridge Analytica used data gathered from a Facebook personality quiz, the Stanford research also incorporated data from Facebook, gathered through a personality quiz called myPersonality, described as “a popular Facebook application that allowed users to take real psychometric tests, and allowed us to record (with consent!)",
  "Currently, our database contains more than 6,000,000 test results, together with more than 4,000,000 individual Facebook profiles.” As of October 2015, more than 7.5 million people had taken the questionnaire and the resulting data had been used by more than 200 researchers, including at least one Facebook data scientist.",
  "Just six months ago two Stanford University researchers set off an avalanche of ethical concern with a paper that used an AI model to estimate a person’s sexual orientation based purely on a photograph of their face, raising concerns of imprisonment and even execution for LGBT individuals living in repressive countries.",
  "Perhaps most famously, in 2008 Harvard and UCLA researchers released a massive dataset compiled from the Facebook accounts of an entire cohort of college students, with the full ethical and legal approval of Facebook and Harvard, full approval of Harvard’s IRB and funding from the National Science Foundation.",
  "Despite declining to comment on the questions posed regarding the study’s ethical considerations, Stanford did provide a brief statement from one of the authors regarding its use of more than 3 million images from Facebook: the images are “secondary data that we have obtained from myPersonality app.",
  "In the end, instead of holding Cambridge Analytica up as a villain, if society at large has concerns about how their Facebook social media personas can be used to monitor and potentially manipulate them, they should take a closer look at the platform that makes it all possible: Facebook.",
  "A year later in the midst of a stunning election upset and investigations of Russian influence, the tenor towards data-driven politicking has turned upside down, with a public outcry over the perceived power of data-driven campaigning to allegedly overwhelm organic public will.",
  "Facebook predictably denied knowledge of how Geofeedia was using its data, yet when the ACLU discovered an email referencing a confidential agreement between Geofeedia and Facebook to provide the company with additional Facebook data, Facebook declined to comment further.",
  "All in all, it is remarkable how in the space of just 8 years data has gone from hero to villain in the world of campaigning, raising questions of whether this will be a tipping point against social media or just another brief bump in the road to quickly wash away.",
  "Indeed, its reaction to the unauthorized research, labeling it as a minor “oversight” and especially its refusal to comment on whether it had identified other unauthorized research and whether it would be tightening its data access controls, as troubling at best.",
  "Putting this all together, casting Cambridge Analytica as a villain gone rogue with “breached” data from Facebook offers a simple cathartic response to a world the press and public are struggling to understand, but it could not be further from the truth.",
  "Though, before attributing absolute campaigning power to data, it is important to remember that Cruz’s failed presidential bid relied on the same firm and data that is credited with Trump’s win, calling into question the level of impact it actually had.",
  "In this light, Cambridge Analytica’s alleged use of Facebook data for voter targeting pales in comparison with the ways in which Facebook itself exploits its private user data for its own purposes and those of the researchers that collaborate with it.",
  "Like the Harvard study 6 years before, the 2014 emotions study generated an immense public, press and academic backlash, with Facebook stating it had redesigned its ethical review process and the journal issuing a statement of editorial concern.",
  "In the leadup to the 2016 election, the press and public derided the Trump campaign as apparently being data-devoid, while hailing Clinton’s campaign as picking up the data-first mantle from the Obama campaign and pushing it even further.",
  "Perhaps the most remarkable takeaway from coverage of the 2016 election is just how starkly changed the reaction of the public and media has been to political use of data-driven election targeting since the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns.",
  "In 2016 Facebook and Twitter terminated social media monitoring company Geofeedia’s access to its data streams after the ACLU published a report documenting how it was being used to surveil lawful protest activity in the United States.",
  "Even when violations are brought to their attention, the companies will at best merely confirm the violations, either dismissing them as minor “oversights” or in the case of external researchers, apparently taking no action at all.",
  "As I noted at the time, “In short, Facebook would not share any details beyond its previous 2014 statement on what changes it has actually made internally, while Cornell and PNAS both noted that they have made only minimal changes.",
  "Indeed, Facebook itself has its own active research program, which as the Australian press leak demonstrates, is conducted under strict secrecy and according to the company itself, may occur without its knowledge or approval.",
  "Yet, despite confirming that the research was a direct violation of its policy, when asked whether it would take action against the researchers or any other researchers that violated its policies, the company did not respond.",
  "Everything the company stands accused of (which again it strenuously denies) are simply what academics at universities all across the world do every day with the full knowledge and approval of their ethical oversight boards.",
  "In 2014 academic researchers at Cornell and Facebook published research in which they had manipulated the emotions of three quarters of a million users and which was published in one of the top scientific journals, PNAS.",
  "As I noted at the time, “it is difficult to imagine that neither Facebook nor Twitter had any idea of any kind that one of their licensees was using their data to provide surveillance capabilities to law enforcement.",
  "It is little wonder then that social media data has found such a place in modern research and may have played such a pivotal role in the 2016 election, or as the Cruz campaign discovered, perhaps no role at all.",
  "The paper was published in an APA journal and reviewed full ethical approval from their IRB, reinforcing the common theme of top journals and institutions as freely accepting sensitive research on social data.",
  "In short, data was good and pushing the privacy and ethical boundaries of data to monitor and manipulate voters was a positive, modernizing campaigning in line with the commercial advertising world.",
  "Yet, when asked for comment on why those policies did not appear to have been enforced for this study, the university declined to offer comment, saying that it was not permitted to do so.",
  "Moreover, even when social media platforms become aware of explicit violations of their terms of service by researchers, it is unclear what consequences, if any, those researchers face.",
  "Even 1984-ish techniques like mining private DVR viewing habits were lauded as brilliant innovations to advance democracy, not frightening autocratic steps towards a surveillance state.",
  "On the sidelines of any academic social sciences conference can be found any number of academics offering to ship bulk extracted Facebook data to fellow researchers.",
  "That Facebook's own researchers have used such external personality quiz datasets is intriguing in light of its concerns with Cambridge Analytica's activities.",
  "Granting agencies like NSF routinely fund the research, IRBs approve it without question (typically treating it as “exempt”) and the top journals publish it.",
  "When asked in 2016 whether its views had evolved since the 2008 release, the university never responded, despite multiple requests to different offices.",
  "As with the Harvard study, the research had been fully approved by Facebook and Cornell, with ethical review by Cornell’s IRB.",
  "It is also not the first time that the company has found itself under scrutiny for commercial targeting based on its data.",
  "Any change the platform makes to restrict bulk access to its data is met with cries of foul.",
  "their psychological and Facebook profiles."
