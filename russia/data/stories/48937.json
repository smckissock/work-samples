  "As a veteran tech investor and early social media adopter, Roger McNamee is uniquely positioned to explain why Facebook and Google are so successful — as well as how “we are drowning in evidence that there are costs that society may not be able to afford.”\n\nMcNamee’s new essay in Washington Monthly, “How to Fix Facebook — Before It Fixes Us,” deftly details social media’s profound impacts on Brexit, the 2016 U.S. election, the news media and, ultimately, all users.",
  "By explaining how social media has been “exploited by a hostile power to drive people apart, undermine democracy, and create misery,” McNamee is attempting to “trigger a national conversation about the role of internet platform monopolies in our society, economy, and politics.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, listens during a talk in San Francisco, Oct. 17, 2007.",
  "“Facebook wasn’t the first social network, but it was the first to combine true identity with scalable technology.”\n\nMcNamee became a Facebook power user by creating a page to market his band in 2007 and building it into one of the highest-engaging fan pages on the ever-changing platform.",
  "“The ‘Leave’ campaign made an absurd promise — there would be savings from leaving the European Union that would fund a big improvement in the National Health System — while also exploiting xenophobia by casting Brexit as the best way to protect English culture and jobs from immigrants.",

  "It was too-good-to-be-true nonsense mixed with fearmongering.”\n\nAnd then came Russia’s multipronged influence operation on the U.S. general election, which involved leveraging Facebook to great effect.",
  "“The Democratic primary was getting underway in New Hampshire, and I started to notice a flood of viciously misogynistic anti-Clinton memes originating from Facebook groups supporting Bernie Sanders.",
  "I didn’t know what was going on, but I worried that Facebook was being used in ways that the founders did not intend.”\n\nRoger McNamee, managing director and co-founder of Elevation Partners.",

  "“My familiarity with building organic engagement put me in a position to notice that something strange was going on in February 2016,” he writes.",
  "“I was convinced that Mark had created a game-changing platform that would eventually be bigger than Google was at the time,” McNamee writes.",
  "But surely the Sanders campaign wasn’t stupid enough to be pushing the memes themselves.",
  "It appeared to be well organized, with an advertising budget.",
  "“I knew how to build engagement organically on Facebook.",
  "This was not organic.",
