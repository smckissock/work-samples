  "In one passage, a “former partner” pointedly exculpates Bell: “When the Gupta project first arose, senior members of the Geopolitical team, including Bell, were quite outspoken that we should not do it.” Henderson and Geoghegan, the dossier alleges, saw the account merely as “a lucrative contract,” and never “appreciated how divisive the project would be and the implications it might have, specifically on the Geopolitical team, who were seeing the immediate impact of the company’s decision to work with the Guptas in their marketing meetings.” To some Bell Pottinger partners, the sudden appearance of the dossier, along with the earlier leaks of sensitive material and the Stephen Grootes interview, suggested that Bell and his allies at Sans Frontières were attempting to destroy Bell Pottinger.",
  "On March 22, 2016, shortly before the trial contract with Oakbay was set to expire, Bell e-mailed Victoria Geoghegan, the publicist, in his characteristically loose style: “on your trip to joberg and capetown this week you are not authorised to agree to go on handling the gupta account nor to resign the account, merely to assess the situation and then report back.” “I’d invite you in, but tracking a wildebeest and then crushing its skull has made me want to get up early tomorrow morning and invent agriculture.” According to several people at the firm, it should have been obvious that the only prudent choice was to resign the Oakbay account.",
  "A South African media source told me that he understood the dossier’s sources to be former Bell Pottinger employees who wanted to “exact as much hurt as possible on Bell Pottinger itself.” On March 19, 2017, the Sunday Times of South Africa ran a long article based on the dossier, which suggested that Bell Pottinger had been hired by the Guptas to “divert public outcry” from “state capture” to “white monopoly capital.” The report cites a former Bell Pottinger “insider” saying that Bell left the firm because he disapproved of its work for Oakbay.",
  "He then issued an “absolute” public apology for the firm’s work on a “social-media campaign” in South Africa that was “inappropriate and offensive.” The next day, Bell told the Financial Times that Henderson “knew all about it from the very beginning.”\n\nBy July, 2017, Bell Pottinger was hated by many South Africans, but the scandal did not gain traction in the United Kingdom until the Herbert Smith Freehills report was commissioned and Geoghegan was fired.",
  "According to another partner at the firm, publicists at rival agencies, when debating whether to represent a questionable individual, used to joke that the answer was either “Yes,” “No,” or “One for Bell Pottinger.”\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Bell Pottinger executives received an inquiry from a potential client, the Azimov Group, which described itself as an international team of investors in the cotton trade who had links to the government of Uzbekistan.",
  "In 2011, Rewcastle Brown was subjected to a series of smears by a blog called Sarawak Bersatu, which described itself as representing a “group of Sarawakians who aim to protect Sarawak against the influences—and hidden agendas—of foreign political groups and activists.” Material posted on Sarawak Bersatu, and on a related Twitter feed, impugned the motives and the reporting practices of Rewcastle Brown and called her an agent of British socialism.",
  "When he started in P.R., he told me, “corporate communications was regarded as like peeing down your trouser leg—it gave you a nice warm feeling when it first happened, but it goes cold and wet pretty quickly.” He boasted, “What we did was move the public-relations advisers from being senders of press releases and lunchers with journalists into serious strategists.” As a former adman, Bell is adept at exploiting images.",
  "That day, Bell Pottinger began what it called a “front-foot campaign” to “get the Guptas’ message out there to counteract negative and threatening press.” Publicists on the account contacted a prominent South African journalist, Stephen Grootes, telling him that, if he agreed to sign a nondisclosure agreement, he could interview “an important person.” Grootes complied, and was informed that the subject was Ajay Gupta.",
  "Business was roaring in while I was running the place.”\n\nIn October, 2016, Thuli Madonsela, the Public Protector of South Africa, whose mandate is to expose threats to the country’s democratic system, published a report titled “State of Capture.” It described “alleged improper and unethical conduct by the President,” and chronicled Zuma’s corrupt dealings with the Guptas.",
  "Collins said that Bell Pottinger’s goal would be “to get to the point where, even if they type in ‘Uzbek child labor’ or ‘Uzbek human-rights violation,’ some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.” The meetings, however, were an ambush.",
  "After tea was served, Bell recalls, he sat through “an hour and a half of Tony Gupta lecturing us on how wonderful he was—he’d made so much money, he didn’t need to make any more money, he was just a good man, he had empowered brown people, he was very well connected to the government, knew Zuma very well.” Gupta requested Bell Pottinger’s help in launching a P.R.",
  "In a speech in February, 2016, Maine said that “the two richest individuals in South Africa have fifty per cent of the economy.” The economic-apartheid rhetoric reflects an uncomfortable truth about South Africa: despite making progress since the end of apartheid, it remains a profoundly unequal country, and the financial divides among ethnic groups are stark.",
  "Moreover, a briefing document from March, 2016, written by Lehrle, proposed creating a blog that contained “emotive language” and “powerful imagery.”) “The whole site is racially motivated,” Henderson told Geoghegan, adding, “We’ve denied that we did this!” Geoghegan explained that the Oakbay team had commissioned a cartoonist to create work for the site.",
  "Because the moment you think, That’s propaganda, the next question is: Who’s put that out?”\n\nUntil 2016, Bell and Henderson had an equal number of supporters on the company’s board, but that summer one of Bell’s oldest allies, Mark Smith, indicated that he could no longer support him, allowing Henderson to take control of Bell Pottinger.",
  "George Pitcher, a former publicist who is now a priest, wrote, in Politico, that the association looked “like a bunch of pimps throwing up their hands in horror at the moral turpitude of their highest-earning whore.” Senior figures at Bell Pottinger speculated that Ingham’s tone had been influenced by Bell, with whom Ingham is friendly.",
  "Branko Brkic, the editor of the South African newspaper the Daily Maverick, whose reporters covered the Bell Pottinger story, told me that the firm’s deployment of the Guptas’ cynical strategy was “beyond the pale.” He said, “Bell Pottinger literally stole the page from Goebbels and applied it to twenty-first-century South Africa.",
  "After the account was renewed, Bell Pottinger continued to draft talking points on economic emancipation, including one noting that “inequality in South Africa is greater today than at the end of apartheid.” It also commissioned advertisements claiming that South African banks had threatened the livelihoods of Oakbay employees.",
  "He had advised the team to create something that captured the gossipy feel of the British blog Guido Fawkes, a pro-Brexit, Thatcherite site that the Guardian has described as “a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine.” The idea was that Voetsek would host content on economic emancipation from other news sources.",
  "It’s almost as if they felt pleasure doing it.”\n\nWhen Henderson later apologized for the firm’s work on the Oakbay account, he wrote that Bell Pottinger contained many “good, decent people who will be as angered by what has been discovered as we are.” Indeed, most Bell Pottinger employees did ordinary P.R.",
  "This does not appear to have happened.” That evening, a former managing director of Bell Pottinger, David Wilson, who left the firm in 2015, learned that Tim Bell was shortly to be interviewed on the BBC program “Newsnight.” Wilson was an investor in Bell Pottinger, and had friends who still worked there.",
  "A client of theirs—me!” Rupert added that Bell Pottinger had described the white-owned businesses supposedly in control of South Africa’s economy as “white monopoly capital.” Rupert’s accusation went viral, and it soon became a widespread notion in South Africa that Bell Pottinger had invented this term.",
  "The partner said the Sarawak work suggested that certain people within Bell Pottinger had “a playbook.” One publicist who helped write the Bell Pottinger playbook is Mark Turnbull, who worked at the firm from 1995 to 2012, and often focussed on geopolitical accounts, including in South Africa and Iraq.",
  "That December, an adviser to BNP Paribas Securities South Africa told Bloomberg News that the relationship between Zuma and the Guptas was “deeply troubling,” noting, “This goes beyond undue influence.” Tony Gupta attended the Johannesburg meeting, as did Tim Bell, one of Bell Pottinger’s founders.",
  "It reported, “While we do not consider that it was a breach of relevant ethical principles to agree to undertake the economic emancipation campaign mandate per se, members of B.P.’s senior management should have known that the campaign was at risk of causing offence, including on grounds of race.",
  "campaign’s theme as one of “economic emancipation,” adding, “The trip was a great success.” Against competition from another London agency, Bell Pottinger won the account, and Oakbay agreed to a monthly fee of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars, plus costs, for a three-month trial period.",
  "According to internal Bell Pottinger documents, the Guptas asked the firm to portray Duduzane Zuma as a “businessman in his own right.” Bell Pottinger also began offering talking points about “economic apartheid” to South African politicians, including Collen Maine, the leader of the A.N.C.",
  "On March 24, 2016, Victoria Geoghegan sent an e-mail to Bell, Henderson, and other executives, which summed up the company’s choice: “As we have known from the start, we are in the middle of a civil war with the Guptas and allies on one side, and Johann Rupert and others on the other side.",
  "“Especially from London.” At a meeting that spring, the executive chairman of the corporate-and-financial division responded to internal questions about Oakbay by saying that the Guptas’ companies were audited by K.P.M.G., an international firm with stringent compliance procedures.",
  "On January 14, 2016, four publicists from Bell Pottinger, one of London’s leading public-relations firms, flew to Johannesburg and met with a potential client: Oakbay Investments, a company controlled by Atul, Ajay, and Tony Gupta, three of South Africa’s most powerful businessmen.",
  "A Bell Pottinger executive quickly replied to the Azimov Group, saying that some of his colleagues would be “delighted to talk to you about how we might best support your enterprise.” Two representatives of the Azimov Group soon came to Bell Pottinger’s main office, in Holborn.",
  "One poster showed Victoria Geoghegan’s photograph along with the slogan “Gupta’s Girl.” That month, Bell Pottinger issued a statement claiming that many assertions in the dossier were “wholly untrue,” and that a “politically motivated” campaign was being waged against the firm.",
  "(Lehrle claims that the account was overseen by the corporate-and-financial side, and that he and his geopolitical colleagues acted “solely in an advisory capacity”; internal e-mails and documents, however, show that he regularly participated in discussions about the account.)",
  "“I’m a bargain hunter.” The dossier’s author seemed intent on associating the Gupta account with Geoghegan, who was described as “leading the project,” and with Henderson, who was said to “not care one bit” about criticism of Bell Pottinger’s decision to work with the Guptas.",
  "And he got all huffy and said, ‘If you’re going to shout at me then I won’t speak to you.’ I continued to lose my temper and walked out.” The root of the problem, Bell said, was jealousy: “He can’t bear that I’ve got a bigger personality than him, and I’m better at the job.",
  "An employee involved in this work does not know the fate of the individuals on the list, but he remains troubled by the fact that Bell Pottinger performed this service at a time when Bahraini officials were imprisoning and torturing people who spoke out against the regime.",
  "Although its author was anonymous, it had an oddly personal tone, citing seemingly irrelevant details about people on the Oakbay account, such as the fact that a wedding venue in Tuscany where Victoria Geoghegan had been married rented for twenty thousand dollars a week.",
  "At a press conference, Francis Ingham, the group’s chairman, declared that Bell Pottinger had “brought the P.R.-and-communications industry into disrepute.” In media interviews, Ingham called Bell Pottinger’s work for Oakbay “the most blatant instance of unethical P.R.",
  "In an interview with the Evening Standard, Bell promised that “every person here is searching their souls.”\n\nIn July, 2012, Bell Pottinger, which at the time was owned by a publicly traded company, Chime Communications, went private, in a management buyout.",
  "“They say that Thatcher had a grip on Britain when she was in power, and the moment she left the grip went.” Bell warmed to his theme: “Henderson doesn’t understand the basic principle of running a public-relations company, which is money in, money out.",
  "However, it is difficult to turn down such a large retainer.” Bell told me that, around this time, he became opposed to renewing the Oakbay account after Johann Rupert left him a message expressing concern that Bell Pottinger was working for the Guptas.",
  "Bell emphasized that he was not without scruples, saying that his “personal morals” would stop him working for someone as cruel as Robert Mugabe, the former dictator of Zimbabwe, whose regime had killed or tortured tens of thousands of his own people.",
  "In the report, a parliamentarian named Vytjie Mentor charged that, in a meeting, the Guptas had told her she could become the minister for public enterprises, as long as she agreed to make South African Airways drop its Johannesburg-to-Mumbai service.",
  "The Twitter account that it launched to support the Guptas regularly promoted content referring to “monopoly capital.” Shortly after Rupert’s speech, a twenty-three-minute portion of Stephen Grootes’s interview with Ajay Gupta leaked on YouTube.",
  "According to a former South African government official, among the document’s sources were “insiders within Bell Pottinger”; he declined to name the insiders, but reminded me that some people at Bell Pottinger had worked for President de Klerk.",
  "Collins told the Azimov representatives, “There is not a problem in getting messages through to them.” The executives also discussed what they called the “dark arts” of optimizing Google searches and editing Wikipedia pages in favor of clients.",
  "When I informed Rewcastle Brown that Bell Pottinger was behind Sarawak Bersatu, she said that she had “no idea this was being run out of London.” A former Bell Pottinger partner expressed shock when I described the Bahrain and Sarawak accounts.",
  "A former colleague recalls Bell saying, “It’s my company—it’s my name above the door.” Publicly, Bell has told several journalists, including me, that he had resigned in protest, because Bell Pottinger had refused to drop the Oakbay account.",
  "services for Oakbay, including “crisis communications.” Bell Pottinger’s work in South Africa included the covert dissemination of articles, cartoons, blog posts, and tweets implying that the Guptas’ opponents were upholding a racist system.",
  "The Guptas, brothers who had holdings in everything from uranium mining to newspapers, maintained close ties with Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, and were notorious for having leveraged this connection for profit and influence.",
  "To make up for all the spending, another partner added, Bell “was reduced to more and more scratching around for the despots and other difficult communications jobs from around the world.” Almost immediately, Bell and Henderson clashed.",
  "Henderson told me that the explanation was simpler: “I made an error of judgment.”\n\nIn March, 2017, a twenty-one-page dossier titled “Bell Pottinger PR Support for the Gupta Family” began circulating in South African government circles.",
  "They boasted about their political connections, noting that one executive at the firm, Tim Collins, had worked with George Osborne, who was now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and with David Cameron, who had become the Prime Minister.",
  "Nine years later, he began advising the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, and helped shape some of her most effective messages, including the “Labour Isn’t Working” campaign, which attacked the Labour Party’s record on employment.",
  "The campaign, Gupta suggested, would not only be beneficial to the country but would also bolster his family’s financial position, by casting the brothers not as overstepping oligarchs but as outsiders countering white supremacy.",
  "Bell said of Oakbay, “I had nothing to do with getting this account!” He continued, “Of course, James Henderson is to blame.” Wark asked Bell, “Do you think this is curtains for Bell Pottinger?” “Almost certainly,” Bell said.",
  "As Bell sees it, Smith “turned on me and stabbed me in the back!” (Smith told me, “I do not want to talk about it.”) Bell threatened to sue the company for wrongful dismissal, and demanded a $6.7-million severance payment.",
  "It took him a year to take it into complete loss-making.” This narrative, I told him, omitted the overwhelming reason that clients had dropped Bell Pottinger: the Oakbay scandal, in which he had played a significant role.",
  "Perhaps because the top executives at Bell Pottinger were focussed on internal rivalries, nobody involved in the decision to represent the Guptas appears to have deeply weighed the risk of working for such toxic figures.",
  "Grootes asked him if any of his family members had flown to Switzerland with the South African minerals minister, in the hope of securing a mining deal between a Gupta-controlled business and the mining giant Glencore.",
  "“He was intent on murdering it.” As the difficult exchange drew to a close, Bell said, “Today’s a big day for them with Bahrain.” The Bahrain account was Bell Pottinger’s largest, and without it the firm would implode.",
  "Many details that leaked to South African journalists in November, 2016, including the fee structure of the Oakbay account, were known only to Bell, Henderson, and the four people working daily on behalf of the Guptas.",
  "Bell also worked for the Pinochet Foundation, which, in 1998, successfully campaigned against efforts to extradite Pinochet to Spain, where a judge had issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of torture and murder.",

  "Among Bell’s other notorious clients are Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus; Asma al-Assad, the wife of the Syrian strongman Bashar; and government representatives of the repressive state of Bahrain.",

  "Henderson told me that, on reading the dossier, he realized that forces were conspiring “against Bell Pottinger, and, to a certain extent, me.”\n\nRelinquishing the Oakbay account did not contain the damage.",

  "According to two former partners, when Tony Gupta awarded the account to Bell Pottinger he included a caveat: he did not want any more face-to-face meetings with Bell, having found him obnoxious.",
  "Bell told me that Gupta’s proposal did not strike him as cynical; he found it “eminently reasonable.” On January 18th, he e-mailed James Henderson, Bell Pottinger’s C.E.O., and described the P.R.",
  "The deal wasn’t entirely satisfying to Bell: although he was a more famous and charismatic publicist than Henderson, and was twenty-three years his senior, he held a smaller stake in the company.",
  "They also accused the Guptas, who were born in India, of running a “shadow government” that swung procurement decisions their way and appointed government ministers aligned with their interests.",
  "In 2010, the Guardian called London the “world capital of reputation laundering.” Most publicists are discreet about working with controversial figures, but Bell is vocally unrepentant about it.",

  "firm inflaming a debate about racial and economic inequality in South Africa in order to benefit a rich family with government connections, the Oakbay work was a flagrant conflict of interest.",

  "When I interviewed Bell at his town house, he told me that his departure had caused a catastrophic leadership vacuum at Bell Pottinger, which ultimately led to the failure of the business.",
  "To the chagrin of many Bell Pottinger employees, however, the firm’s efforts to reduce debt were felt most keenly in its lower echelons: employees say that their compensation was mediocre.",
  "The discord intensified in 2014, after Bell published a memoir, “Right or Wrong.” While promoting it, he spoke to the Financial Times and said, of bankers, “They’re all complete criminals.",
  "Soon after British journalists took note of the Gupta account, the Democratic Alliance, a liberal South African opposition party, organized protests outside Bell Pottinger’s headquarters.",

  "Some former Bell Pottinger employees say that Henderson’s decision to maintain the Oakbay account can be attributed not just to financial pressure but to his arrogant management style.",
  "An “anti-embarrassment clause” was attached, allowing Bell Pottinger to exit the contract if the worst allegations against the Guptas, such as the bribery accusations, were confirmed.",

  "A representative promised to hand over the footage to Grootes after a “light edit.” Grootes agreed to the arrangement, but said that he would make a simultaneous recording.",

  "(The company, which has changed its name to Percepto, has said, “We now regret our involvement.”) Bell Pottinger’s efforts on behalf of the Guptas became increasingly ugly.",
