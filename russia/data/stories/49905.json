  "\"You have chosen instead to send less senior representatives, and have not yourself appeared, despite having taken up invitations from the US Congress and Senate, and the European Parliament,\" wrote Damian Collins, Chair of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, and Bob Zimmer, Chair of the Canadian Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.",
  "The report, by the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport, claimed social media and mass data collection created a crisis for democracies, It said campaigns could engage in \"relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behaviour.\"",

  "In a letter sent Wednesday to Zuckerberg and released to the public, the British and Canadian committee chairs chastised the Facebook founder for ignoring previous invitations to appear at their separate inquiries.",

  "Both the Canadian and British committees plan to release final reports in December, which is why Zimmer and Collins said in the letter the need for Zuckerberg's testimony is \"overdue, and urgent.\"",
  "During an Oct. 2 phone call with CBS News, Zimmer said American politics has prevented the Senate's investigations of election interference from being as aggressive as those of the Parliaments.",

  "The company's Chief Operating Officer and CEO have each appeared before Canadian Parliament to testify about the company's involvement with Brexit campaigns.",

  "\"We don't have Citizens United and all the money and outside influence that comes with that,\" Zimmer said.",
  "Collins and Zimmer ask in the letter for Zuckerberg to reply by Nov. 7.",
  "\"We're mostly average Janes and Joes who are interested in the truth.\"",
  "The Canadian investigation has honed in on Aggregate IQ.",
  "The hearing is scheduled for Nov. 27 in London.",
  "\"No such joint hearing has ever been held."
