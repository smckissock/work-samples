  "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday morning, Schwartz called the motion \"a reckless use of the legal system in order to continue to inflate Michael Avenatti's deflated ego and keep himself relevant.",
  "But Avenatti says the agreement is not valid because Mr. Trump never signed it, because Mr. Cohen violated it by making public statements, and because the terms of the agreement are \"unconscionable.\"",
  "David Schwartz, an attorney who serves as a spokesperson for Michael Cohen, said shortly before the motion was filed: \"I'm sure he [Avenatti] does want to depose the president.",
  "He argues it's enough that Mr. Cohen signed it on behalf of the Delaware-based limited liability corporation, Essential Consultants, which paid Stormy Daniels the money.",

  "His statements are ludicrous when he asks where Michael Cohen and Donald Trump are?",
  "If there is no agreement, Avenatti argues, there is nothing to arbitrate.",
