  "Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn two days of public grilling, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stated repeatedly that if you use Facebook, you can control the data Facebook shares about you with its advertisers and with the world.",
  "This was perhaps the most shocking section, as it involves lists shared with Facebook where my name appears, even though I have no idea who some of these companies are, or how they wound up identified with my Facebook profile.",
  "In the meantime, for people like me, that don't want to quit Facebook, we can limit the ads Facebook shows us through its internet spying practices, limiting the financial reward it gets for such creepy behavior.",
  "It's not easy to do that, but through its Ad Preferences page, I can opt out of seeing ads based on how Facebook is monitoring my internet use by clicking on \"no\" \"no\" and \"no one\" in the settings.",
  "When I signed up, I made a deal with Facebook and I was OK with it: I get to use it for free and in exchange I willingly share some info about me to let Facebook serve me relevant ads.",
  "Facebook/Business Insider\n\nNext up, I went through the \"Your interests\" settings: what Facebook thinks it knows about me in terms of business, hobbies, sports, travel, etc..",
  "In addition to the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Audience Network, Facebook owns a company, Atlas that puts a bit of code on your browser to watch what you do on the internet.",
  "On top of that, if I visit a website that is using the Facebook Pixel, Facebook knows I've been to that website and can show me an ad for the company in my newsfeed.",
  "So, if the nation wants more control over how our lives are being watched, we'll need to push, and probably regulate, Facebook and the whole internet ad industry.",
  "Sure, Facebook, go ahead and send me all the ads you want about things I want to buy: bicycles, skiing, fitness, fashion, travel, pets, movies, books and so on.",
  "At that time, it instituted privacy controls that seemed to put me in control, to tell Facebook which people can see my posts, friends or the public.",
  "If you are an ad industry employee with information about surprising or unethical ways internet companies gather and use data, we want to hear it.",
  "For instance, the Facebook Audience Network is used by mobile apps serves ads in a mobile apps and analyzes what people do with a mobile app.",
  "Facebook says that, even if I limit my interests, it will still show me ads based on the following:\n\n\"Your age, gender or location.",
  "Zuckerberg also repeatedly told Congress that Facebook doesn't share my info directly with advertisers, nor does it sell my data.",
  "And it owns Onovo, a security app that was the subject of another privacy scandal for its policy of sharing data with Facebook.",
  "In other words, while you can control the ads you see, you can't really control the information that Facebook gathers on you.",
  "Facebook/Business Insider\n\nI started to do the same for the section marked \"Advertisers you've interacted with.\"",
  "Ad blocker AdGuard recently analyzed 2,556 popular apps and found 41% of them use Facebook Audience Network.",
  "That means, even if you don't use Facebook, these apps could be sharing data about you with Facebook.",
  "Facebook also owns \"Moves,\" a fitness tracking app that monitors your location, if you use that app.",
  "Facebook/Business Insider\n\nBut because Facebook is ad-supported, it warns that I will still see ads.",
  "Now, Zuckerberg insisted many times in his congressional testimony that I can control the ads I see.",
  "Pixel is a popular tool used by website owners to track and analyze what you do on their websites.",
  "But as Facebook's data privacy scandal has embroiled the company, I've grown increasing disgusted.",
  "It was also filled with politicians (like Doug Robinson, below), most of whom I didn't know.",
  "This requires sifting through the list of stuff it tracks on me, one by one, and deleting.",
  "But after 15 minutes, with no way to know how close I was to the end, I gave up for now.",
  "And Facebook is still tracking more information about me for this purpose than I want.",
  "Facebook/Business Insider\n\nI also adjusted what Facebook thinks it knows about me.",
  "Back in 2014, Facebook began watching people as we wander across the internet.",
  "65% of the apps that AdGuard analyzes used one of Google's tracking services.",
  "Again, I'm A-OK with that, especially ads on topics of interest to me.",
  "I had to delete them one-by-one, including the ones listed in \"more.\"",
  "But it's harder to tell Facebook which data on me to use for its ads.",
  "It uses data on me to decide which ads to show to which people.",
  "That last bit, \"Facebook Companies\" is particularly worrisome.",
  "jbort@businessinsider.com or DM me @Julie188 on Twitter.",
  "The advertiser, who is paying the bill, gets to choose.",
  "By the way, Google does this on an even bigger scale.",
  "I will come back to it and delete more each day.",
  "The content in the app or website you're using.",
  "Your activity off of the Facebook Companies.\"",
  "I started with the \"Your categories\" setting.",
  "I love Facebook and don't want to delete it.",
  "But that's only half of the story.",
  "That's creepy and annoying.",
  "But I don't get to choose.",
  "It sounded great."
