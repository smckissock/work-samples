[
  "So, all of these facts put together make this meeting particularly explosive because, you know, the e-mail -- even if this lawyer didn't have any information and it was just a big setup to get in there to talk about sanctions, right, the fact that these campaign, senior campaign officials eagerly sought out this person and eagerly said saw an e-mail that described the Russian government trying to help Donald Trump's campaign and instead of saying, wait a second, this could be an issue for us to take to the FBI which is what several campaign officials told me today they would have done, they didn't do that.",
  "But clearly, this is a dramatic step forward in the investigation and is the first time the public has seen clear evidence that not only was there an organized Russian government effort that the intelligence committee has already validated to reach out and try to downgrade Clinton and help Trump, but you've also then seen senior level officials from the Trump campaign, his son, his son- in-law and the campaign manager welcomed that kind of assistance.",
  "What is startling about in these e- mails, I mean, one of the many things is that this is as far as we know the first time although it doesn't sound like it's the first time Donald Trump Jr. is hearing about it because he sort of doesn't really seems to react to it, you have in the e-mail someone, this guy Goldstone, saying that this information came from the Russian government and the Russian government is backing his father.",
  "I mean, if Donald Trump Jr.'s learning whether it's for the first time or he's heard it before that the Russian government, according to this e-mail is backing his father, and you know, according to his lawyer willing to provide dirt, does it -- is it credible that he wouldn't at some point say to his dad, the craziest thing happened today or last week, the Russian -- this person says the Russian government is backing you.",
  "But I do think it is strange to me that a meeting of this type that had been -- and we don't know whether Mr. Kushner actually saw this e-mail traffic, but if he did see this e-mail traffic that indicated this meeting was going to be part of a campaign of the Russian government to provide information that would be helpful to Trump and hurtful to Clinton, that Mr. Kushner wouldn't remember that meeting.",
  "You can't call a rookie mistake not having the knowledge that if you got an e-mail that acknowledges that at least on its face says we've got information that's part of a Russian government effort to try to help his father, anyone with a lick of sense would know that you don't take that kind of help from a foreign government and particularly a foreign adversary.",
  "It should be -- it's also interesting to note, Anderson, that we contacted Jared Kushner's lawyers a couple weeks ago to tell them we were aware that they had update FS86 to note the existence of this meeting that had been organized by Donald Trump Jr. We didn't hear much from them until the story appeared in \"New York Times\" over the weekend.",
  "The idea that he would never have had a conversation either before this meeting after receiving the e-mail or after the meeting, even though there was allegedly no there there, to point out to his dad, you know what, I got this thing that's claiming the Russian government is backing you, I mean, that's kind of a bombshell in these e-mails.",
  "I think if and when he's asked about this later on this week, he cannot say any more, I don't think, that there might have been other countries involved in the meddling in last year's election when you have these e-mails going back from his own son and this music producer talking about the Russian government's support for his campaign.",
  "COOPER: Does it matter whether this Russian attorney really did work for the government or not, or is the key point that Donald Trump Jr., according to these e-mails, seemed to believe not only that this information whatever it was going to be came from the Russian government but also she was described as a Russian government lawyer?",
  "I mean, a standard operating procedure for the Russian intelligence services in a situation like this is, you know, if you are indeed reaching out to somebody, a high-level person in the Trump team, you don't want to do it with an official person, you don't want to do with an intelligence officer or an official government person.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Senator Warner, this report that the details of the interactions between the interactions between Donald Trump Jr. and this Russian attorney weren't fully known to the special counsel until recently, I'm wondering, were you -- was your committee aware of these emails before today or yesterday?",
  "But most important, this is about the son, son-in-law and campaign manager of the president of the United States willingly engaging in an opportunity to subvert the interests of the United States to a foreign power, embracing it willingly and enthusiastically, according to the son of the president of the United States.",
  "COOPER: Just very briefly, the attorney for these two Russian guys, the pop star and his father, says that the pop star was basically making this connection to Goldstone for the Russian attorney, just -- she was an acquaintance of his and he was just doing a favor because that's how things work and people do business.",
  "COOPER: Congresswoman -- (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: -- when you were running, you had gotten e-mail from, you know, an intermediary saying that the Russian government is backing you and there's a Russian government attorney who'd like to meet with you to give you dirt on your opponent, would you have had that meeting?",
  "WARNER: Well, it's interesting that not only was he excited to receive this information and the e-mail was explicitly clear that this was part of a Russian government effort, but it even seemed like he was trying to time the release to that information by saying it would be great if we got this late summer.",
  "Donald Trump's strange defense of Michael Flynn, him firing the FBI director, repeatedly defending Putin, repeatedly going to bat for Russia, repeatedly saying that the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the election last year at the very least casting doubt on that assessment.",
  "We also know, Anderson, that the FBI investigators have in the past year they've been doing this investigation have spent time looking at the business dealings of Donald Trump Jr., as well as, you know, some of his associations with Russians, as part of the broader investigation into Russian meddling.",
  "In fact, these e-mails, again, in very plain English lay out even more, politically motivated contact with a Russian individual with claims of ties to the Kremlin, promising information that would help achieve what is billed as the Russian goal of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump.",
  "But it is a grave concern to me that you've got the senior most officials in the Trump campaign actively at least soliciting or being willing to accept at least information from a foreign government, in this case a foreign adversary, Russia, in a way that would be interference in our elections.",
  "(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSANDERS: I think that the president is, I would say frustrated with the process of the fact that this continues to be an issue, and he would love for us to be focused on things like Justin mentioned, the economy, on health care, on tax reform, on infrastructure.",
  "RYAN LIZZA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, look, if this were something that was just simply in isolation, that none of the events came after it, I could understand some of the defenses of it as no big deal, just meeting with someone to learn a little bit about the opponent's campaign.",
  "But, honestly, if this was the only thing that had happened, the fact that there is an e-mail that says refers to the Russian government supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump and this does not seem to be a shocking revelation to Donald Trump Jr., this is like a mid conversation.",
  "COOPER: Jeffrey Lord, when President Trump praises his son's transparency, I mean do you believe that what Donald Trump Jr. has done over the last couple of days is being fully transparent because he does seem like --\n\n\n\nJEFFREY LORD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Unequivocally.",
  "Around the same time, Paul Manafort provided some more specifics to one of the congressional committees that is investigating whether there was any collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, and there was a reference to this meeting there, as well.",
  "There's no doubt in my mind that the lawyer, Veselnitskaya, had to have been from the government because nobody else would have had the type of information that she would have claimed aside from somebody who had some sort of contact with the Russian government.",
  "The only time we're going to see the president tomorrow is when he walks in front of the cameras to get on Marine One to start heading over to Paris for his trip over to France at the end of this week, where he is supposed to hold a news conference on Thursday.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[20:41:13] COOPER: After Donald Trump Jr. twitted his Russia meeting e-mails this morning igniting a firestorm critic from both sides of the aisle, White House Spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stayed mum in off camera press briefing.",
  "But she did say in response to one question about, well, you know, there are people up on Capitol Hill talking about perjury and even using the word treason, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that that -- the use of those words would be, quote, ridiculous.",
  "It's nothing that can be described as anything by what it actually is -- simple words from a string of e-mails between Donald Trump Jr. and a family acquaintance with something to offer, allegedly coming straight from the Russian government.",
  "In doing my research I came across an interview with Dick Morris at \"Newsmax\" in September of 2016 in which he says that President Clinton personally in 1996 meddled and colluded, if you will, in the Russian election to elect Boris Yeltsin.",
  "COOPER: -- to one of -- you know, the June 6 e-mail, is there was, in\n\n\n\nfact, some kind of conversation that Donald Trump, Jr. tells Goldstone in the email to have your client call him on a cell phone after he gets off stage performing.",
  "If someone claiming to represent the Russian government had reached out and said, first of all, we're supporting your candidate, and second of all, we dug up some (INAUDIBLE) to give to you, I'd be petrified that I'd be in trouble.",
  "Why in the heck this administration that says there's no there there, if there's no there there, why wouldn't they have come clean with all of this information to our committee when we started this investigation six months ago.",
  "And secondly, if there was a phone conversation between Donald Trump Jr., and this Russian pop star, is it likely or possible that that somewhere was picked up and is recorded somewhere, whether either in the U.S. or overseas?",
  "I think that there has been some frustration on the part of Donald Trump Jr. and people close to him about how the last couple of days have gone in terms of the disclosures and in terms of sort of this slow roll, drip, drip.",
  "It doesn't matter really whether this Russian lawyer has connections with the Kremlin, as \"The New York Times\" reports it does, and doesn't matter whether she had information or they were disappointed with what they heard.",
  "Does it -- is it possible that Donald Trump Jr. would not have told his father that Russia -- that he has learned or been told that Russia is backing his campaign whether it was before this meeting or after this meeting?",
  "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is asking the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to look into how the Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump Jr. was allowed to enter the country.",
  "(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\n\n\n[20:05:01] COOPER: The White House says the president did not know about the meeting last year, which happened just one floor down from his office at Trump Tower where he happened to be at the time.",
  "And of all this will get back probably to questions about who has been the source of some of the information that's gone to \"The New York Times\" through the great reporting they have been doing over the last few days.",
  "So I think Jared Kushner, who is the one who has senior job in the administration, he is the one who is at more risk frankly than Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Steve Hall, a long time CIA officer focusing in Russia.",
  "That's part of what you see is going to be part of the focus here because not only did you not disclose it the first time, but then the second time when you filed the information, you didn't include this meeting.",
  "Also the question is, I mean, according to these e- mails, there's phone -- actual phone conversation between Donald Trump Jr. and this Russian pop star whose father was this very wealthy real estate developer.",
  "MOOK: What we're saying is it's OK to foreign powers to interject in our elections and back a certain candidate because a president took a foreign policy position, because I'm actually going to add on to this.",
  "(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you stand by a statement you made yesterday when you said that our position is that no one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election?",
  "This was, again, just basic information that was going to be possibly there -- I didn't know these guys well enough to understand if this talent manager from Miss Universe, you know, had this kind of thing.",
  "And again, this is the plain and simple language from e- mails released by Donald Trump Jr. himself as part of his evolving explanation of this meeting which \"The New York Times\" first revealed on Saturday.",
  "COOPER: Tim, this was also during a time that is important around the context of all of this where there was a power struggle within the campaign between Corey Lewandowski --\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: And Paul Manafort.",
  "But, A, how likely is it that U.S. intelligence would have been aware that potentially Kremlin linked individuals who are trying to connect with the son of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee?",
  "So to me, this sounds a little bit like the Russian is trying to go a little further in this operation and actually tried to get a human angle to it in addition to the other stuff if that they were up to.",
  "We begin tonight, for the first time in the entire Trump-Russia saga with clarity, with something that cannot be discounted, downplayed or spun as complaints from a losing campaign or called fake news.",
  "From the opening e-mail dated June 3rd of last year, quote, some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.",
  "But, you know, if you sort of rewind back to when this all happened last year, I mean, what this looks very much to me like is the Russians at the time had a very successful influence operation going.",
  "In fact, the previous Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, was ridiculed by me and others wrongly for saying Russia was our chief geo-strategic adversary, right, at that time I was more upset about ISIS.",
  "When we come back, we're going to hear from political operatives about how they see the latest revelations about the Trump campaign meeting and what that means for the future of this administration.",
  "I know you guys are going to get tired of it today and not to sound like a broken record, but on all questions related to this matter, I would refer you to Don Jr.'s counsel and the outside counsel.",
  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This administration disagrees with all of the stories that claim that the president and his campaign colluded with Russia in any capacity.",
  "COOPER: Robby, would you -- if for Russian, you know, somebody Russian from -- said they were from the Russian government, we're sending a Russian government attorney, is that business as usual?",
  "That is from a music producer named Rob Goldstone passing on information he says is from a Russian pop star who himself is the son of a real estate mogul known as the Donald Trump of Russia.",
  "And, you know, one of the things that Donald Jr. told me was that if you get 100 things right but one thing wrong, you're going to hear about it for the rest of your life from Donald Trump.",
  "And, you know, this is something that is certainly going to be of interest to Director Mueller and his team in determining what he, you know, what went on at this meeting is very important.",
  "They had something -- you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about, that they were probably underreported for, you know, years, not just during the campaign.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.",
  "COOPER: I talked to the attorney, and we're going to play some of that interview coming up, the attorney for the pop star and his father who say to his knowledge, he said, two things.",
  "They're positioning themselves vis-a-vis the press about Donald Trump Jr. and his father and they're not thinking strategically about the legal the consequences that they're in now.",
  "You can't -- by the way, the notion that every campaign does it, I've been in touch over Twitter publicly with Matthew Dowd who ran Bushes campaigns to Spencer or Romney's campaign.",
  "You look at Carter Page who was Donald Trump's foreign policy advisor, the Russians were talking about the man one or two years earlier about potentially bringing him on as a spy.",
  "And that what we've heard more now since this e-mails is that, well, Donald Trump Jr. was politically naive and just, you know, made a mistake here or something he shouldn't done.",
  "Goldstone goes on to say in that same message, quote, this is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.",
  "I would -- listen, I'm going to try to give everybody the benefit of the doubt, but the idea that somehow that would be a rookie mistake, I find just not believable on any level.",
  "Well, to your first question, we have reached out to the lawyer for Donald Trump Jr. said that we were familiar with the contents of these e-mails and we're planning to publish.",
  "So, you know, you have to take into consideration that some of this just may be garbage in terms of what this person was offering Donald Trump Jr. and his friend Rob Goldstone.",
  "He has now filed a second amendment to his SF86, it's the form that he submitted to the FBI in order to get his security clearance which he is still, you know, working to get.",
  "The other person who may have a problem is Jared Kushner because, you know, it is -- that form, the application for a security clearance is submitted under penalty of perjury.",
  "They're going to take a look at not only the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. has now disclosed, but also these e-mail interactions to see what exactly might have happened here.",
  "However, critics of the \"Washington Post's\" Philip Bump for this, there's a moment from the stump that looks maybe a little different tonight in light of Trump Jr.'s e-mails.",
  "And from there, Trump Jr. and Goldstone go on to set up a meeting with someone Goldstone first calls, quote, the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.",
  "A speech his father gave on June 7th of last year, four days after that first e-mail promising dirt on Hillary Clinton and two days before the meeting actually took place.",
  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, AMERICAN POLITICAL AIDE: I do, and again, I don't have -- beyond the statements yesterday and what I need today, I don't have anything else to add.",
  "But, again, this is a pattern that we've seen from a host of Trump officials where they deny any kind of contact with Russians until they see proof, until proof is shown.",
  "We're also learning that details of the interactions between Trump Jr., Goldstone and the Russian attorney were not fully known to federal investigators until recently.",
  "[20:15:03] SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA), RANKING MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Anderson, I'm not going to comment what the committee knew or didn't know and when we knew.",
  "I mean, even the fact that Donald Trump Jr. gave an interview tonight to Sean Hannity obviously a friendly outlet, but--\n\n\n\nD'ANTONIO: Had to drive his lawyer's nuts.",
  "I\n\n\n\ndon't mean necessarily an obstruction of justice, but we now are at the question what did the president know about many of these events and when did he know it.",
  "LEWIS: I think the other interesting thing that people keep bringing up and I think for very good reason is that we don't know that nothing came out of this meeting.",
  "This is the president's own son who sat down with an attorney from Russia under the assumption that she had some kind of damaging information about Hillary Clinton.",
  "COOPER: It's interesting to hear Donald Trump Jr. in that clip on Sean Hannity say that, you know, this was a nothing -- there was nothing to talk to his dad about.",
  "COOPER: Right, because they cite three -- if I'm getting it correctly, if memory serves me correctly, in one of their reports, three people advised the White House.",
  "And Donald Trump Jr. has just spoken out, telling FOX's Sean Hannity\n\n\n\nhe did not discuss the meeting with his father and talking about his thoughts going into it.",
  "BEGALA: First of all, I read Jeffrey's column and what he alleges my old boss did was phone up Yeltsin and say you should run ads on this because he is a kibitzer.",
  "He wants to talk to this Russian pop star who I guess he's met before and it's all about -- he gives him his cell phone and he has to wait until he gets off stage.",
  "ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Maggie Haberman, obviously, you know, from the times it broke the story, what -- just in terms of some process, I have two questions.",
  "COOPER: Yesterday, it seemed like a lot of surrogates for the president on air elsewhere were saying, well, you know, this kind of a meeting happens all the time.",
  "And now, we're hearing from Trump surrogates, well, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\n\nwas naive to the ways of politics and didn't realize he shouldn't have had this meeting.",
  "Some -- probably, I think it was about six weeks or so ago, when they submitted a bunch of information, 300 pages worth of information to Senate investigators.",
  "I would say it's also possible that the intelligence community may have had some indication that the Russian government was attempting to arrange this meeting.",
  "Now, we have these e-mails in which this person is described as a Russian government attorney and that this information is coming from the Russian government.",
  "COOPER: Yes, we're taking their times --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLORD: Anderson, talking about transparency, I just posted an article with \"The American Spectator.\"",

  "But the meeting with Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer -- Jared Kushner only updated I understand his security form recently to reflect that he was there.",
  "And now, of course, now, the special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI agents who are doing this investigation are going to be taking a look at this.",
  "In other perspective, Eric Trump's theory is that some people just can't stand that the Trump family is extremely close and always support each other.",
  "COOPER: Why would somebody in the White House or connections to the White House supposedly supports the president leak stuff about Donald Trump Jr.?",

  "You were recusing to characterize anything about Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\n\nHAYWORTH: I'm saying that Donald Trump Jr. did nothing with that information.",
  "D'ANTONIO: I think what Tim just said about the president having never operated anything in an orderly and deliberate fashion is absolutely true.",
  "And also Jared Kushner, my understanding is three weeks ago or so, he amended his security request to get a security clearance with this meeting.",
  "WARNER: I'm not going to -- I want to give Mr. Kushner the chance to come in and talk to our committee before I reach those kind of conclusions.",

  "Paul, you know, two things we've heard from Trump surrogates over the last couple of days is that this is just standard operating procedure.",
  "Look, the president gave a statement on the matter, which I read to you, and like I've said, I don't have anything else to add beyond that.",
  "Yes, it's certainly possible that the intelligence community may have intercepted, specifically NSA may have been intercepted such a call.",

  "COOPER: You might have sat down with somebody who said they were from the Russian government with Russian government.",
  "But from my reading on this, I think it would have come up sooner if the intelligence community had been aware of it.",
  "And I think the Russian intelligence and the Russian government said, you know, we should try for the trifecta here.",

  "This is something --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right, it's almost like a second reference or there's no --\n\n\n\nPOWERS: Exactly.",
  "But I think the other --\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We've heard throughout the campaign how his kids are his closest advisers.",

  "To repeat myself, I'm going to refer you to the outside counsel and I don't have anything else to add.",
  "It doesn't -- he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would protect his father plausible deniability.",
  "COOPER: So, there was never a phone conversation between Donald Trump, Jr. and either of your clients.",

  "But really, it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting was actually about.",
  "In one, he said there was no phone call, and then he said to his knowledge there was no phone call.",
  "He receives, unsolicited, just opens the mailbox one day and there's the Bush debate briefing book.",

  "And when he did give it, he took the usual shots at Hillary Clinton but did not add anything new.",
  "And curiously enough, it was late summer when you saw much more of a DNC hacked e-mails come out.",
  "You started to see information that was saying that John Podesta's e- mails would be forthcoming.",
  "You know, in terms of Kushner, forgive me, Anderson, I'm not entirely sure what you're asking me.",
  "You have some sort of plausible deniability to say sort of exactly what you're saying, Anderson.",

  "Joining us now, two men who wrote books on Donald Trump, Michael D'Antonio and Timothy O'Brien.",
  "What Donald Trump is doing is trying to divide us and he is siding with the enemy, with Russia.",
  "But beyond that, it also raises this question of when did the president know about the meeting?",
  "COOPER: The president today in a statement praised his son's transparency was the word he used.",

  "This would have been very porous and I can't imagine he didn't inform his father right away.",
  "I mean, in the e-mails, Donald Trump Jr. says that's a prerequisite for having this meeting.",
  "So, we know that Jared Kushner's lawyers filed this amended SF86 form in the last few weeks.",
  "He wasn't as he first said motivated to meet this woman out of concern for Russian orphans.",
  "And that Donald Trump Jr. didn't know the identity of the person that he was meeting with.",
