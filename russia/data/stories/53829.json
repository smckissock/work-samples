  "#Basta — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) June 15, 2018\n\nDays before Election Day in 2016, Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 through a shell company called Essential Consultants to stay quiet about an alleged sexual encounter she had with Mr. Trump in 2006.",
  "Sources familiar with Cohen's legal problems said he is increasingly feeling isolated from Mr. Trump and his allies, and Cohen appears to be moving closer to a legal strategy of cooperating with investigators given the gulf that now exists between him and Mr. Trump.",
  "Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime personal attorney, has filed a request for a restraining order from a Southern California court against Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film actress Stormy Daniels.",
  "We just learned that Mr. Cohen and his atty, Brent Blakely, are going to file a motion seeking to have the court issue a gag order preventing me & others from providing info & docs to the media and the public.",
  "In May, Avenatti publicly released Cohen's bank records, which showed American companies and foreign interests had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to the same shell company Cohen used to pay Daniels.",
  "Cohen's motion cited interviews Avenatti gave as recently as Wednesday on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" and \"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\"",
  "Within days of the April 9 raid, Mr. Trump's allies publicly debated whether Cohen would hold up to the scrutiny and whether he would then cave and cooperate with investigators.",
  "He was prominently mentioned in the unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a former British spy which alleged coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.",

  "Daniels has sued to get out of a nondisclosure agreement regarding her alleged encounter with Mr. Trump, and she is suing Cohen for defamation.",
  "When the story broke about the payment earlier this year, Cohen said he paid Daniels with his own money and Mr. Trump did not know about it.",
  "Mr. Cohen and Brent Blakely can’t deal with the truth, the facts, and the law, so they have to resort to unethical, meritless motions.",
