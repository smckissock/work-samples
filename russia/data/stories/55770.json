  "Earlier this week, Manafort had tried to deny as “unfounded, silly and nonsensical” claims that he had received cash payments worth up to $12.7 million from a “black ledger” controlled by Yanukovych’s “Party of the Regions.” However, the Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko backed up those claims Friday, showing that a certain Vitaly Kalyuzhny had signed nine times for receipt of payments designated for Manafort.",
