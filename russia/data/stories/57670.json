  "Applications for the warrant, its renewals, and related documents were approved, it notes, by James Comey, the former head of the F.B.I., whom Trump dismissed last May; Sally Yates, an Obama appointee who clashed with Trump over his travel-ban executive order when she was briefly acting Attorney General (he fired her); Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., who, under pressure from Trump, announced his retirement this week; and Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, who is a Republican but also the person who has the authority to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation.",
  "officials, determined to stop the election of Donald Trump, applied for and got a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page—a man with vague business interests in Russia who was, for a time, an adviser to the Trump campaign—using a shoddy dossier, assembled by a former British intelligence officer named Christopher Steele, which they knew had been paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.",
  "The proper title of the memo is “Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” FISA allows a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to approve spying on non-Americans and, in certain cases, on Americans in connection with foreign-intelligence investigations.",
  "Although the memo notes that the application was one involving “probable cause,” under Title I of FISA, rather than the even more lax Section 702 of Title VII, one problem that the memo does illustrate is how easy it is to get permission to spy on Americans; the FISC is non-adversarial and almost never says no.",
  "The Democrats might, more productively, have focussed on what President Trump now seems likely to do with the memo—namely, trying to cripple the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and what may be his own efforts to obstruct that investigation.",
  "According to the memo, her job was “to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump,” and Ohr “later provided the FBI with all of his wife’s opposition research.”\n\nThese assertions may, as has been said of much of the memo, be misleading and lack context.",
  "On Friday afternoon, the House Intelligence Committee released what has become known as the Nunes Memo—named for the committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes, who has talked up its contents as though they were the key to a great conspiracy.",
  "According to the memo, at least some officials also knew that Steele “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected.”\n\nThe memo says that the dossier formed an “essential part” of the application for the warrant.",
  "Republicans, including Nunes, have not been as interested in abuses of FISA that do not involve their President, and recently passed on a chance to reform the standards of Section 702, in particular.",
  "As it happens, at around the time the application was made, on October 21, 2016, the F.B.I.’s leadership was also discussing jolting the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails back into action.",
  "Indeed, the purpose of the memo does not seem to be FISA reform; instead, it looks like a justification for firing people in the Justice Department whom Trump doesn’t like—or has already pushed out.",
  "Perhaps that information is included in the counter-memo that the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee have written; the Republicans controlling the committee have not allowed it to be released.",
  "said that it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” The phrase “grave concerns” raises worries that national security might be harmed.",
  "It’s worth reassuring the public of any rules limiting the ability of a consulting firm, or any private entity, to effectively pay, indirectly or not, to get someone’s name in the F.B.I.’s files.",
  "Otherwise, they risk landing in the same territory as Trump, who, in a tweet on Thursday, claimed that the “investigative process” had once been “sacred”—until it was directed at him.",
  "But critics of Trump should also not fall into the trap of elevating that process—of claiming that, as a general rule, the issuance of a FISA warrant alone proves much of anything.",
  "should also have revealed that the Trump campaign had its own issues—or maybe just that it was a chaotic time, with accusations and counter-accusations being thrown around.",
  "But the memo also does not seem to betray any “sources and methods”—a phrase used by those who like to keep anything classified secret—that have not already been revealed.",
  "Some readers will likely see the memo that way, though its revelations are notably thin, to the point of raising questions about why, exactly, the Democrats and the F.B.I.",
  "got mixed up with opposition research, and put it in a warrant application, along with, according to the memo, a Yahoo News story for which Steele was also the source.",
  "And it is worth keeping in mind that, whatever one thinks of Page, any American with whom he had been in contact might have been drawn into the surveillance, too.",
  "Depending on one’s mind-set, that either suggests that pro-Clinton forces were desperately looking for dirt to counter that story, or that the F.B.I.",
  "In the context of FISA, it wouldn’t have taken much to get a warrant, with or without Steele, especially given Page’s business relations in Russia.",
  "The memo’s complaint is that none of them told the FISC about “the political origins of the Steele dossier.”\n\nPlaying politics is a tricky charge.",
  "It also, the memo notes—and this part has caused excitement among Trump supporters—hired the wife of Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official.",
  "The Times, in its report, cited sources who said that the role of Ohr’s wife, whose name is Nellie Ohr, was minor and her knowledge limited.",
  "Or was the narrative laid out in the memo just, all around, a story that was incomplete and unfairly causing embarrassment?",
  "Indeed, the memo is a reminder that it’s always worth scrutinizing government claims about what must be kept secret.",
  "(If Trump wants to fire Mueller, the thinking goes, the easiest way might be to get rid of Rosenstein first.)",
  "(The FISC’s approval of the mass collection of data on Americans was one of Edward Snowden’s revelations.)",
  "Democrats on the committee dispute this, suggesting that there was plenty of other material on Page.",
  "Some portion of that money went to Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, for the production of the dossier.",
  "(For example, how much “later” did Ohr share his wife’s research, and how was it used, if at all?)",
  "In a way, this is also a story about money in politics,and its transparency-obliterating effects.",
  "(Earlier, Fusion GPS had taken money from anti-Trump conservatives for related research.)",
  "Nothing in it diminishes, for example, the relevance of the larger Mueller investigation.",
  "In partisan hands, human messiness can all too easily be made to look like conspiracy.",
  "But the whole subplot has the dispiriting look of a Washingtonian revolving door.",
  "objected so passionately to making it public, adding to the hype along the way.",
  "Sometimes, in those cases, it helps to make more information public—not less.",
  "paid a law firm, Perkins Coie, millions of dollars for legal services.",
  "The pursuit of Martin Luther King, Jr., is only one such example.)",
  "What if the target had not been Trump but one of his opponents?",
  "Page is not even, to borrow the memo’s word, “essential” to it.",
  "The Nunes Memo is shoddy and slanted, but it is not explosive.",
  "That doesn’t mean that all the mess is particularly inspiring.",
  "The alleged abuses are that Justice Department and F.B.I.",
  "(The government calls this “incidental” contact.)",
  "In a statement issued on Wednesday, the F.B.I.",
  "It is worth reflecting on just how the F.B.I.",
  "(Many Democrats have been absent, too.)",
  "The Clinton campaign and the D.N.C.",
  "(Or a civil-rights leader?",
  "Fusion GPS hired Steele."
