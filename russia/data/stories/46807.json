  "Other foundation donations went to overtly or implicitly political groups:\n\n$500,000 to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland\n\n$500,000 to a group doing voter registration at NASCAR races\n\n$250,000 to the American Conservative Union, which runs the Conservative Political Action Conference\n\n$250,000 to the anti-union Center for Union Facts\n\nIn total, we estimate that $5.2 million went to such groups from the foundation.",
  "We can look at the foundation’s spending in four groups:\n\nDonations to conservative think tanks (in green below)\n\nDonations to organizations that bolster conservative political causes (in light blue)\n\nDonations to organizations focused on questioning climate science (the lightest shade of green)\n\nDonations to educational or arts groups (middle shade of green)\n\nAbout $6 million of the Mercer contribution wasn’t spent.",
  "\n\nBillionaire Robert Mercer speaks on the phone during the 12th International Conference on Climate Change hosted by the Heartland Institute on March 23, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post)\n\nWe may never know how much money billionaire Robert Mercer put into political activity during the 2016 election cycle.",
  "Other political committees that received at least $100,000 from Mercer:\n\nKelli PAC (affiliated with Kelli Ward), $700,000\n\nWarrior PAC (supporting Rob Maness), $600,000\n\nFighting for Ohio Fund (supporting Sen.",
  "For another, some portion of Mercer’s spending probably went to “dark money” organizations, nonprofit groups that aren’t required to publish their donor lists but can spend money on political activity.",
  "In total, including money paid by the foundation, Mercer probably spent about $30 million directly on political campaigns, and gave to political PACs and nonprofit groups and through his foundation.",
  "They’re a good example of the gray area that such nonprofit organizations occupy: Although not explicitly calling for the election of Donald Trump, they don’t leave much doubt about their intent.",
  "Media Research Center is one of those edge cases: It polices what it considers liberal bias in the media, with the net effect of aiming to boost conservatives in politics.",
  "That’s not what it was always called; during the Republican primary, it was called Keep the Promise, one of several PACs dedicated to electing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)",
  "We’ve named the other businesses to which Mercer may have contributed: Breitbart News, Cambridge Analytica and a film-production company called Glittering Steel.",
  "The campaign then started using Cambridge Analytica, Mercer’s data firm, to supplement its voter outreach and hired Kellyanne Conway from Keep the Promise.",
  "The next biggest recipient is the Media Research Center, which works to undercut mainstream media reporting and boost conservative media.",
  "The next largest investment was to a PAC associated with John Bolton, recently named President Trump’s third national security adviser.",
  "The biggest beneficiary of the money that was spent is Donors Trust, an umbrella organization for conservative nonprofit organizations.",
  "This is one reason billionaires like Mercer give to PACs that do outside advocacy: There are no limits to how much they can spend.",
  "The group Secure America Now produced videos warning ominously about Muslim takeovers of France, Germany and the United States.",
  "How did the Center for Responsive Politics learn that Mercer gave to the group if the group doesn’t have to report its donors?",
  "The foundation also gave $2 million to the Government Accountability Institute, which aims to expose corruption in government.",
  "The group received a bit over $5 million and worked with Facebook and Google ad sales teams to optimize the reach of the ads.",
  "On Thursday, the Center for Responsive Politics reported on one example of Mercer contributing to just such an organization.",
  "That number could grow, depending on whether other dark-money groups inadvertently reveal their donors to curious reporters.",
  "(Glittering Steel was paid by the pro-Trump PAC to presumably make ads, although some have questioned that arrangement.)",
  "A bit lower on the list is Reclaim New York, a nonprofit organization that promotes engagement in local politics.",
  "In 2016, it spent about $19 million — meaning that Mercer’s contribution alone covered the foundation’s outlays.",
  "Let’s break down the political spending (which includes contributions in the 2016 cycle — meaning also in 2015).",
  "(The foundation is directed by his daughter Rebekah Mercer, who works closely with Mercer on political issues.)",
  "We know, too, that he has made investments in businesses he was involved in, although not necessarily in 2016.",
  "The nonprofit foundation files an annual report called a 990 articulating where its money was spent.",
  "The $2 million spent on Secure America Now was the third largest expense from a PAC or campaign.",
  "The biggest chunk, $15.5 million, was spent on a pro-Trump PAC called Make America Number 1.",
  "Campaigns, in light blue at the top of the chart, could accept only a few thousand dollars.",
  "About $25 million was spent directly on politics, including that $2 million in dark money.",
  "We know that Mercer spent more than $49 million in 2016 (and the 2016 election cycle).",
  "For one thing, the definition of political spending is surprisingly nebulous.",
  "(Among other things, it operates the anti-mainstream media site NewsBusters.)",
  "(Bolton’s PAC spent some of that money on Cambridge Analytica as well.)",
  "Does his co-ownership of Breitbart News during the 2016 campaign count?",
  "An additional $25 million was donated to the Mercer Family Foundation.",
  "The Mercers, you may recall, switched to Trump in the middle of 2016.",
  "So let’s figure out how much Mercer spent on politics in 2016.",
  "The video below was published three days before the election.",
  "We don’t know how much he may have spent with each company.",
  "It called and asked, and was given a list of donors.",
  "Each, though, was engaged in 2016 politics.",
  "That $49.8 million was split in two pieces.",
  "Mercer gave $2 million.",
  "More on that in a bit.",
