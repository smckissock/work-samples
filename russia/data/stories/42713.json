  "While some services, including Ello and Diaspora, have been over-optimistically hailed as potential “Facebook-killers”, they have struggled to catch on for a simple reason: these other sites and apps can provide features similar to (and in theory, better than) Facebook, but if your friends and family aren’t using them, what’s the point?",
  "Nextdoor is about connecting users with the people in their real-life community – where they live – while Raftr takes the approach of linking people who are interested in the same topics or activities, wherever they are in the world.",
  "However, the fact that the opportunity to mine user data for advertisers was one of the reasons cited by media giant Time Inc when it bought Myspace in 2016, perhaps it is best not to rush to revive your Top Friends list just yet.",
  "Last year saw plenty of speculation that Snapchat was losing customers to Instagram in particular, although for the moment there is no sense yet that the flow is reversing following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.",

  "Messaging is the easiest: apps such as Telegram and Signal offer messaging and group chats, as well as voice calls, with encryption to keep your communications private.",
  "“Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place,” it explained in a blog post announcing the change.",
  "Like Vero, it is promising to avoid advertising (and thus selling users’ data), although in this case the chosen method is donations rather than subscriptions.",
  "It did not make much of an impact until earlier this year, when its downloads suddenly soared, sending it to the top of app-store charts across the world.",
  "In February, founder Ayman Hariri was criticised over past associations with a company that was the subject of allegations concerning employee conditions.",
