  "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson initially said “steps are under way” to develop a new international coalition to oust Assad: “it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.” Then he backpedaled, insisting that the administration’s focus on the Islamic State was unchanged, since a political resolution would require “participation of the regime and the support of their allies.” He also expressed the hope “that we can work with Russia and use their influence to achieve areas of stabilization throughout Syria.”\n\nIn contrast, Ambassador Haley spewed fire and brimstone while seeming to push aside her nominal boss.",
  "Noted Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky of the Woodrow Wilson International Center and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, respectively: “one of the more stubborn realities of the Syrian conflict is that America’s Sunni Arab partners—with the exception of small Jordan and vulnerable Lebanon—have talked tough but done little in the way of absorbing refugees or contributing forces to the actual fight against ISIS.”\n\nThe desire to end the suffering is laudable, but impractical.",
  "For instance, on March 30 UN Ambassador Nikki Haley declared: “Our priority is not to focus on getting Assad out.”\n\nCandidate Trump went on to make a promise extraordinary for Washington, that “unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct.” Warrior wannabe Republican and Democratic leaders sniffed their disapproval, but he well captured the frustrations of the American people who do the paying and dying in America’s many conflicts.",
  "Peace is impossible “as long as Assad remains in power,” she insisted: “we’ve got to go and make sure that we actually see a leader that will protect his people.” She allowed that “Getting Assad out is not the only priority”: The U.S. also has “to get out the Iranian influence,” which is necessary “for peace and stability in the area.”\n\nMoreover, Haley insisted that Moscow and Tehran “now have to answer for” their support for the Assad regime.",
  "McMaster implausibly contended that there was no difference between the positions taken by Tillerson and Haley: “There has to be a degree of simultaneous activity, as well as sequencing the defeat of ISIS first.” He added: “the resolution of the conflict will entail both of the elements that you’re talking about.” In short, the U.S. must both destroy the Islamic state and overthrow Assad, but do so in the right order.",
  "Almost exactly a year ago he gave a major address to the Center for the National Interest in which he criticized nation-building and especially the disastrous Iraq and Libya interventions: “After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before.”\n\nHe also promised to step back from confrontation from Russia.",
  "Indeed, the conflict features a who’s who of America’s dubious friends, frenemies, adversaries, and enemies all at each other’s throats: Assad government, Sunni jihadists and terrorists, Iranian-supported militias, Russian, Saudi, Qatari, and Turkish forces, Kurdish fighters, immoderate “moderates,” and more.",
  "Even in “victory” Washington would find a host of new tasks to perform: defeat radical forces, protect victimized minorities, create stable governance, eliminate Iranian and Russian influence, mediate between Turks and Kurds, and whatever other fantasies filled the minds of Washington’s social engineers.",
  "Last October candidate Trump warned against starting “a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III.” Additionally, the Putin government can advance or hinder U.S. policy objectives in Europe, Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea.",
  "When it comes to sanctions against the two states nothing “is off the table.” She promised that the president “won’t stop here.” Indeed, if “he needs to do more, he will do more.” The administration will exercise “strong leadership,” whatever that means, she insisted.",
  "Along with discouraging the Islamic republic from developing nuclear weapons, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or nuclear accord, increased the likelihood of internal political change by creating greater economic opportunities for younger Iranians.",
  "Rep. Trent Franks declared “making it clear that innocent victims of terrorism and evil do have at least one friend in this world” is a “vital American interest,” which, if true, means both nothing and everything are vital interests.",
  "After being criticized for his newly discovered militarist instincts, he proclaimed: “We are not going into Syria.” Three years ago he opposed demands that President Barack Obama bomb the same regime for the use of the same weapons.",
  "One need not like Vladimir Putin to realize the importance of having a working relationship with its government, which, despite its aggressiveness on Europe’s periphery, nowhere threatens fundamental American security interests.",
  "Just last week he declared that “I’m not, and I don’t want to be, the president of the world.”\n\nAlas, less than three months after taking office for President Trump seemed to start channeling Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.",
  "The most important difference among them for Washington is that many of Assad’s opponents are interested in killing Americans and other people outside of Syria, most notably the Islamic State and other jihadist groups.",
  "Even if Syria mattered more it would not justify intervention by the U.S. Policymakers have turned military action into a first resort, but war is different in kind and not just in degree from other policy options.",
  "But Chinese President Xi Jinping probably never imagined even in his fondest dreams that yet another Washington administration would rush toward into yet another no-win Mideast war—and so early after taking office.",
  "For instance, President Trump said it is in the “vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,” even though they weren’t going anywhere.",
  "To start, the president has no legal authority to attack Syria—the post 9/11 congressional authorization obviously doesn’t apply and Damascus has not attacked or threatened America or even an American ally.",
  "For instance, despite almost six years of war and the deaths of several hundred thousand people in Syria, he apparently was not aware that the conflict had resulted in extraordinary human hardship.",
  "Consistency may be the hobgoblin of small minds, but it still matters in foreign policy, especially when the president of the United States reportedly is basing his decisions on casualty photos.",
  "In 2013 the former declared: “Obama needs Congressional approval.”\n\nWar advocates ignore the obvious, that attacking Assad inevitably empowers the Islamic State and other radical Islamists.",
  "The president also declared that “These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated.” Chemical weapons are awful, but not obviously worse than bombs or even well-aimed bullets.",
  "For instance, the irrepressible Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has yet to find a war that he doesn’t want others to fight, claimed “regime change is now the policy of the Trump administration.",
  "He said President Barack Obama should not intervene even if Damascus crossed the latter’s chemical weapons “red line.” And candidate Trump urged cooperation with Moscow in Syria.",
  "So after seeing what he called “horrible” photos of some of the scores of dead from an apparent Syrian chemical attack the president ordered strikes on a Syrian military base.",
  "Secretary Tillerson argued that the potential of insurgents grabbing chemical weapons posed an “existential” threat to America, but ISIS already is believed to possess them.",
  "Moreover, moving toward war in Syria sets up a great power confrontation with Russia, the one nation with a nuclear force which allows it to go head-to-head against America.",
  "Sen. John McCain, perhaps the Senate’s most belligerent member, dismissed the danger of such a clash: they “will not want a confrontation with the United States of America.",
  "Having a friendly regime in Damascus matters far more to neighboring Tehran than distant America, so the clerical regime is willing to sacrifice much more than Washington.",
  "America’s support for Riyadh’s horrid war in Yemen makes Washington complicit in the death of thousands of civilians who have done nothing against the U.S. or its people.",
  "The likelihood that the Trump administration could create stable democratic rule Syria is even less than the chance it could do so in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya.",
  "“You cannot have a stable Syria without jihadist elements on the ground with Bashar al-Assad in power.”\n\nThe ivory tower commentariat, too, went into full war cry.",
  "And if they do, they will lose, because we are superior to them militarily.”\n\nHowever, with far more at stake, Moscow is willing to spend and risk far more.",
  "Many so-called moderates do not appear to be terribly moderate, and they have not demonstrated the ability to defeat both Assad and the jihadist movements.",
  "But someone who then launched cruise missiles after seeing what he called “horrible” photos could end up taking America into several wars in coming years.",
  "Perhaps the only good to come from the North Korean crisis is that the Trump administration apparently forgot Syria while shouting threats at Pyongyang.",
  "Indeed, the Assad government is a costly investment: it is wasting its allies’ lives and materiel while generating international hostility toward them.",
  "“I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength [not] only is possible, [but] absolutely possible.",
  "Instead, it would just set off a new combat round in a situation dramatically, even exponentially, more complicated than previous conflicts.",
  "Despite Syria’s friendship with Iran, the latter remained well behind the military capabilities of Saudi Arabia and its Sunni coalition.",
  "Imagine the ISIS flag rising over Damascus and angry victors slaughtering Alawites, Christians, and other religious minorities.",
  "While there’s no good reason for Washington to jump into the Syrian imbroglio, there are several powerful reasons to stay out.",
  "That’s at least what I’ve heard.” The equally war-happy Sen. Marco Rubio criticized Secretary Tillerson for focusing on ISIS.",
  "Ironically, they have been targeted by Damascus because the prospect of Western support made them particularly dangerous.",
  "Anyway, Tillerson’s scenario is implausible at best: smuggling them in and using them would be extraordinarily difficult.",
  "Treating death by chemicals as so much worse than death by other weapons makes a moral mountain out of a policy molehill.",
  "The regime may kill more prodigiously, but primarily as a result of its greater capability rather than lesser morality.",
  "Donald Trump spent the presidential campaign insisting that Washington’s first duty was to protect the American people.",
  "Finally, the president’s potential diversion back into the Middle East likely is causing high-fives all over Beijing.",
  "Its Mideast allies include Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, all of which have dubious human rights records.",
  "His vision was inconsistent and incomplete, but still sensible enough to horrify Washington’s bipartisan war party.",
  "Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon,” he explained.",
  "Moreover, given the debacles in Iraq and Libya, Washington could not simply walk away after defenestrating Assad.",
  "Even if Iran and Russia are able to “save” Assad fils, the regime will be a ghost, a remnant of what it once was.",
  "President Trump came into office breathing fire against the People’s Republic of China on a range of issues.",
  "Air power alone is unlikely to defeat Assad: “boots on the ground,” as the saying goes, would be necessary.",
  "And there should be no illusions about who would do the fighting if Washington jumped into the Syrian war.",
  "In March Washington deployed U.S. forces to separate Turkish-backed and Kurdish forces, which had clashed.",
  "While there undoubtedly are liberal, democratic insurgents, there is a surplus of bad guys on both sides.",
  "After being defeated by Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Damascus retreated to a cold war with Israel.",
  "Indeed, candidate Trump urged President Barack Obama to get legislative authority before bombing Syria.",
  "The allies’ focus on ISIS gave the Assad regime another reason to focus its efforts on other groups.",
  "But journalists and policy analysts will enthusiastically cheer on the sacrifice by U.S. personnel.",
  "Apparently nothing wins acclaim in Washington like killing foreigners in the name of doing good.",
  "Critics of Donald Trump exhibited a strange new respect for him after he launched the missiles.",
  "President Trump seems to know better than to entangle America another Middle Eastern imbroglio.",
  "No matter the disastrous consequences of Washington’s oft-attempted global social engineering.",
  "The Constitution places the decision to initiate hostilities with Congress, not the president.",
  "Actually, he is responsible for America, the liberty, security, and prosperity of its people.",
  "During the Cold War the regime, headed by Assad’s father, was allied with the Soviet Union.",
  "It should be reserved to protect America, which is not threatened by the Syrian civil war.",
  "Today Syria is a wreck and has international significance primarily as a battlefield.",
  "In contrast to nuclear and biological weapons, chemical agents are not mass killers.",
  "So far continuing U.S. restrictions have actively impeded such a transformation.",
  "Confronting Tehran in Syria undercuts the possibility of liberalization in Iran.",
  "Argued Briton Piers Morgan: Assad will “keep doing this until somone stops him.",
  "Hopefully that will end any administration thought of joining the Syria fight.",
  "War advocates tend to stretch the concept of “vital” interests to nothingness.",
  "He’s already appeared to back down and move toward a more normal relationship.",
  "Syria meddled in neighboring Lebanon, but with little impact on anyone else.",
  "He offered a radical but welcome departure from Obama administration policy.",
  "He insisted that the Islamic State was America’s primary objective in Syria.",
  "Its members are never so eloquent as when demanding that others go to war.",
  "The U.S. has no simple means to bring liberal order out of brutal chaos.",
  "Creating a security crisis would make positive change even less likely.",
  "The war lobby also pushed back against Tillerson’s apparent retreat.",
  "He declared that as president he now has “responsibility” for Syria.",
  "Then his aides began talking about taking further military action.",
  "He obviously believes that that is the American military’s job.",
  "And that requires staying out of unnecessary wars, like Syria.",
  "The difference does not justify Washington joining the war.",
  "Most of the casualties have been combatants, not civilians.",
  "Nothing in the conflict warrants Washington’s involvement.",
  "Until last week he and his appointees followed this line.",
  "Washington’s humanitarian record is a bit threadbare.",
  "There’s no reason for Washington to join the fight.",
  "Syria’s fate has little impact on U.S. security.",
  "And ousting Assad would not end the fighting.",
  "Of course, Syria is a humanitarian tragedy.",
  "WHO will stop him?” Certainly not Morgan.",
  "Candidate Donald Trump got Syria right.",
  "He had acted “presidential,” said one.",
  "But it is a civil war, not genocide.",
  "He applied both principles to Syria.",
  "National Security Adviser H.R."
