  "\"The enhancement of America's missile defense capability will, in theory, undermine the effectiveness [and] efficacy of nuclear strikes launched by its main strategic rivals, thus consolidating its own domination,\" according to an op-ed Thursday on the Chinese military's official web portal.",
  "Russia's and China's first-strike capability and their response capability are \"neutered\" by the U.S. missile defense, according to Ed Turzanski, an international policy and national security expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think-tank based in Philadelphia.",
  "Turzanski, who worked in the U.S. intelligence community in postings throughout Asia and Europe during the Reagan administration, noted that during the Cold War there was an agreement with the Soviet Union that limited the number of U.S. interceptor missiles on each side.",
  "'Many different ways'\n\nNorth Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Friday quoted a military spokesman for the hermit state as saying the U.S. is \"sadly mistaken if they think such missile interception system can prevent the shower of [a] nuclear strike.\"",
  "At the same time, China's semiofficial Global Times said this week that the interceptor test is proof the U.S. may be preparing for military action against North Korea and also that the technology \"breaks strategic balance among nuke-armed countries.\"",
  "\"There are many different ways that a missile can trick an interceptor,\" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think-tank based in Washington founded by former President Richard Nixon.",
  "China believes the systems \"will also stimulate other countries to develop strategic penetration technology at a faster pace or enhance their own strategic defense capability, which will exert a new impact on international security.\"",
  "During Tuesday's test, the U.S. military intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile target fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during a test of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, system.",
  "And the North Koreans also are believed to be developing similar capabilities, which creates additional national security concerns given Pyongyang's rapid advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
  "The Pentagon's successful interceptor missile defense test this week is seen as a step toward reducing the nuclear risk from North Korea, but now China and Russia are seeing the U.S. technology as a threat.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted as much Thursday\n\n\n\n\"This destroys the strategic balance in the world,\" Reuters quoted Putin as saying in remarks at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia.",
  "\"They believe they were put in a situation where they are going to have to counter that, and that's the age-old story of military capability,\" he said.",
  "Still, the use of numerous decoy missiles or countermeasures by an enemy could overwhelm or confuse the interceptor system and render it useless.",
  "Regardless, North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday that its military was \"ready to conduct an ICBM test-fire at any time.\"",
  "\"We knew the minute you had the ability to knock my missile down, you had survivability and you could launch a first strike with impunity.",
  "There's an expectation that U.S. adversaries will intensify efforts to counter the GMD and other missile defense technology.",
  "The interceptor test took place a day after the North Korean regime fired its ninth ballistic missile test this year.",
  "The test is seen as a sign the U.S. military is making progress to combat the mainland U.S. threat from North Korea.",
  "Russia and China already have developed countermeasures to increase the chance of a missile reaching a target.",
  "In Alaska, and now in South Korea, elements of the anti-missile defense system are emerging.",
  "Besides California, the U.S. also has the GMD system deployed at Fort Greely in Alaska.",
  "Added the Russian leader: \"What is happening is a very serious and alarming process.",
  "This week's test also was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM target.",
  "Tuesday was only the 10th successful test out of 17 conducted since 1999.",
  "We wouldn't tolerate it from them, they are not tolerating it from us.\"",
  "That agreement ended when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.",
  "We are thinking about how to respond to these challenges.",
  "Should we just stand idly by and watch this?",
  "This is a challenge for us.\"",
  "Story continues",
  "Of course not."
