  "(Photo: Sean Rayford, Getty Images)\n\n\"I expect that from Trump,\" said Rick Pennington, a 23-year-old from Charleston, S.C., who also supports Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.",

  "Before the event, USA TODAY Network talked with 11 attendees to gauge their reaction to the controversial plan by the candidate atop GOP presidential polls.",
  "Then, one of Pennington's friends, 23-year-old John Patel, also of Charleston, said his mother fled the Iranian Revolution, turning the tone more somber.",
  "Then, a protester, one of around 10 removed during the event, called the proposal \"racist,\" which resulted in boos and yells from the rest of the crowd.",
  "But when Trump himself read the release, word for word, to a standing-room-only rally aboard the USS Yorktown, much of the crowd stood and applauded.",
  "They said they disagreed with Trump's idea – and viewed it more as \"an entertainment thing\" than a policy – but would still consider voting for him.",
  "Most, though, said Trump wouldn't be able to pass such a ban anyway, so his suggestion didn't impact their opinion of him as a candidate.",
  "Trump cited a questionable online poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy, an organization with an anti-Muslim reputation.",
  "Democrats are unconstitutionally pushing for gun control, he said, but Trump shouldn't infringe on the right to practice religion.",
  "There's an issue that needs to be addressed, but I think ... shotgunning it out to barring everyone is not the right idea.\"",

  "He called for some sort of controls on the Internet, to help restrict recruiting and publicity by the Islamic State.",
  "In his speech on the USS Yorktown, Trump again called into question the teachings and activities in Muslim mosques.",

  "Still, Trump should continue \"to put some ideas out there,\" said Gavin Morris, 43, of Mount Pleasant.",
  "The poll found 25% of Muslim-American respondents thought violence against Americans is justified.",
  "\"I think that's pretty backwards thinking, like similar to the 50s, you know, with black people.",
  "\"But we just need to put them in some reasonable basis,\" calling the proposal \"unrealistic.\"",
  "Perhaps, she said, one of his staff members got the details wrong in writing the statement.",
  "a man yelled, referencing the sizable Middle Eastern population in Detroit's suburbs.",
