  "After months of misleading stories in the news media surrounding the dossier, Trump was attempting to point out that the news media was ignoring Senate testimony last week in which an expert witness charged that the firm that produced the dossier, Fusion GPS, had previously done work “on behalf of the Russian government.”\n\nOlbermann claimed of the “Pee Pee” dossier story that “few people besides him (Trump) seem to take” it “seriously or even think” it is “relevant.”\n\nPerhaps the former MSNBC host missed that, according to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.",
  "Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column.”\n\nMcClatchy reported last month that it was among “at least a dozen national media organizations” that “had a copy of the Steele dossier before it became public but hadn’t published details because much of the information had not been corroborated.”\n\nDespite Comey’s claims about pending media stories on the dossier, it was actually Comey’s very briefings to Trump and Obama that gave the news media the opening to start publishing the dossier contents, as this reporter previously documented.",
  "One of the most widely reported and mocked claims in the document was that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, he hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.”\n\nOlbermann’s conspiracy theory that Trump is driving the Russia narrative to the fore is contradicted by the near constant stream of stories and leaks on the matter, with many being driven by the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN.",
  "Meanwhile, Olbermann’s claim that Trump is driving news media coverage of the dossier rests on a single tweet sent out by the U.S. president linking to a Fox News story last week titled, “Firm behind anti-Trump dossier also worked for Russia, Senate witness says.”\n\nIn other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election – and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices.",
  "Only two weeks ago, for example, the Washington Post cited alleged U.S. intelligence intercepts leaked by current and former U.S. officials claiming that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told his superiors at the Kremlin that he discussed issues related to the 2016 presidential campaign with Jeff Sessions, despite the attorney general’s assertions to the contrary.",
  "On January 10, CNN cited “multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings” – in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings – revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.",
  "“Boy Scouts, Scaramucci hired, Scaramucci fired, paddy wagons, transgender troops, Priebus, repeal and replace, McCain, Murkowski and go Bannon yourself — all of it in roughly one week — filling the airwaves, consuming the internet, breaking Twitter, causing the Russia story, the dossier, the tape to all recede into the darkness,” Olbermann stated.",
  "Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.",
  "Olbermann may have also missed that, in April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking a FISA court’s approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.",
  "Yet Olbermann claims that Trump is deliberately fueling the public fixation on what the leftist Internet personality wrongly called the “Pee Pee Tape.” Olbermann suggests that Trump is bringing the headlines back to the dossier issue amidst an avalanche of negative coverage on other matters related to the Trump administration.",

  "https://t.co/mMSxj4Su5z — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017\n\nOlbermann asserts that Trump tweeted the story to keep the dossier in the headlines instead of noting that Trump was attempting to shine a light on media hypocrisy regarding the story.",
