  "[The Comey hearing was Washington’s great fashion show of 2017 — and Comey dressed like its star]\n\nAs Zuckerberg sat in an extra-padded seat pulled up to a modest table in front of 42 members of the Senate who were there to talk Russia, Cambridge Analytica and invasion of privacy, his eyes were wide and occasionally darted around the packed room.",
  "They are the uniform that he claimed for himself, the clothes that gave him one less thing to think about every day but that also helped to define him as the youthful entrepreneur who upended communications, newsgathering, advertising and countless other things that we probably don’t even realize yet.",
  "\n\nFacebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg appears for a hearing at the Hart Senate Office Building (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nFashion critic\n\nDid anyone really think Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg would come to Capitol Hill to testify before Congress wearing a T-shirt or a hoodie?",
  "He looked like a 33-year-old man burdened with having to explain technology to legislators who are more than twice his age and don’t really want to hear about how users can change their settings; they just want him to fix what’s wrong with the damn thing.",
  "No matter how deserved his reputation as a cultural disrupter and a Silicon Valley savant, he knows the difference between chatting up millennials on some LEED-certified tech campus and being roasted over the flames in a wood-paneled Senate hearing room.",
  "(Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency/Rex/Shutterstock)\n\nOne suspects that once Zuckerberg finishes his Washington grilling, he will return to Silicon Valley and to his T-shirts and hoodies.",
  "His shirt collar was most certainly too big, and his pale blue tie was knotted so loosely that it hung from his neck as if it had been pre-tied and quickly looped over his head.",
  "Zuckerberg, new to the witness walk and the hours of testimony, has not perfected the art of pretending that the myriad cameras clicking around him don’t exist.",
  "Instead of casting his gaze into the middle distance as he walked from one office to another, he often focused directly into a camera’s lens.",
  "The tech entrepreneur sipped and sipped on water as he listened to Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) drawl “lied” into a three-syllable accusation.",
  "The witness managed not to grimace when Grassley enunciated Zuck-er-berg as if he’d laid eyes on the name only moments before.",
  "He wore a better-fitting jacket back in 2011 during a town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters with President Barack Obama.",
  "Mark Zuckerberg can’t stop staring into the cameras as he walks to the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Monday.",
  "He looked rather elegant in 2015 when he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, attended a state dinner at the White House.",
  "When he arrived on Capitol Hill on Monday for a series of preliminary meetings, he was followed by photographers.",
  "(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nZuckerberg was dressed in a navy suit that looked rather large for his modest frame.",
  "And his resting expression, as the hearing went on, shifted from shellshocked to angry to impatient.",
  "(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nHis hair was cut so close that it was more like penitence than grooming.",
  "There may be some sense of relief and comfort in slipping on one of his trusty gray T-shirts.",
  "He nodded slightly as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) delivered a brief history of Facebook.",
  "Mark Zuckerberg taking one of many, many sips of water while testifying on Capitol Hill.",
  "He did not have the demeanor of the smartest and most impressive guy in the room.",
  "He’s part of it now — no matter how grudging he might be in accepting that.",
  "Zuckerberg, looking almost elegant, with his wife Priscilla Chan in 2015.",
  "But the days when it symbolized daring and innovation are over.",
  "The question is whether he can ever get comfortable in one.",
  "His claustrophobic circumstances are palpable in his eyes.",
  "He was wearing the tie, but he clearly didn’t want to be.",
  "Zuckerberg did not give Capitol Hill his sartorial all.",
  "The result was that he appeared startled and confused.",
  "There’s no going back to T-shirts and hoodies.",
  "There was no hint of pride in his appearance.",
  "Everything about his attire was perfunctory.",
  "He understands traditions and protocol.",
  "He could have done better, and he has.",
  "He knows how the establishment works.",
  "It is now emblematic of recklessness.",
  "Zuckerberg is one of the suits now.",
  "Zuckerberg did not look at ease.",
  "He looks like he wants to flee.",
  "No personal flair or polish.",
  "Of course he’d wear a suit.",
  "He does not exude control.",
  "He did not look cocky.",
  "He wore a tie, too.",
  "Has he outgrown it?",
  "He has to be."
