  "If so, he would be stressing to the President and his associates the following: there is no way to topple Assad other than to intervene with several hundred thousand American troops; persisting in the attempt to set up a Sunni protectorate under American auspices in the Syrian-Iraqi desert is a fool’s errand with no strategic rationale; continual Turkish sustenance for ISIS (as well as al-Nusra) greatly exacerbates the challenge of suppressing it; permanent bases (or toll roads manned by Blackwater-like thugs) in Syria and/or Iraq will worsen threats to American security while providing little tangible advantage; the choices in Afghanistan are between withdrawing now with mission unaccomplished or withdrawing later with mission unaccomplished at far greater cost; Russia does not pose a military threat to its European neighbors in terms of its security interests, capabilities, intent or deterrence calculations.",
  "The Pentagon brass may well be less concerned about “winning” in Afghanistan, whatever that means, than they are living with the intolerable perception that they “lost.” No general cum security policy-maker wants to be saddled with the label of “loser.” That sensitivity can become institutionally generalized; Generals Mattis and McMaster are in little danger of being blamed personally for failure in Afghanistan.",
  "He wrote his doctoral dissertation at the University of North Carolina on the topic – the work that has given him the reputation of being the best mind in the Army – the embodiment of the “soldier-scholar.” The book’s thesis is that the uniformed military’s leaders failed in their duty by not remonstrating against Lyndon Johnson’s misrepresentations of conditions in Vietnam.",
  "They include the lure of celebrity, time pressures due to an excess of travel and/or summonses to mind-numbing TV interviews, long-tedious-inconclusive meetings (such as those presided over by Susan Rice which drove Chuck Hagel out of government), endless bureaucratic games-playing, distracted Chief Executives who demand ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers to complex issues.",
  "However, the efforts to reach those goals deserve the designation of ‘dumb’ when: 1) the resources requisite for success are clearly absent; 2) the odds on achieving success have been skewed so as to obscure how improbable the outcome sought actually is; and/or 3) flawed logic is used in relating means to the stated end.",
  "All of these patterns with attendant adverse consequences are more likely to crystallize into stupid acts when the man nominally in charge lacks the intelligence, emotional stability, self-awareness and/or advisors to recognize either the requirements for sound policy-making or for implementation.",
  "It takes a combination of education/training, intellectual integrity, a cultivated sense of responsibility, discomfort with deciding on the basis of skimpy or suspect information, and an ingrained preference for knowing why you’re doing something instead of flying by the seat of your pants.",
  "American foreign policymakers may wish to mask the Kabul government’s faltering popular support because doing so means a fundamental rethink of aims- an agonizing reappraisal for which they are unprepared intellectually, politically, and diplomatically.",
  "If one were to postulate that these are cardinal objectives, then campaigning to send several thousand more troops on a strategically pointless mission is logical – and the plan’s promoters not as obtuse as they appear.",
  "That exercise calls to mind the WW II submarine hunter who innovated by drilling a hole in the bottom of his boat to better track his prey – the main difference being that the U-boat hunter knew how to swim.",
  "Not only is that world fundamentally different from the world of public affairs (and especially foreign policy) Further, Trump partially compensated for his flaws through coercion, cheating, and duplicity.",
  "The numerous organizations, bureaucracies and individuals involved in decision-making typically lead to a convoluted process wherein it is easy to lose track of purposes, priorities and coordination.",
  "**\n\nThe commander of U.S. forces, General William Westmoreland, was notorious for his upbeat testimony to Congress and other public statements which bore only the faintest connection to reality.",
  "On all of these matters, McMaster – like Secretary of Defense General James Mattis – has rendered quite the opposite advice (as far as we know) while publicly fostering a fantasy view of them.",
  "We can say that the policies have not been fully thought through; that they are misguided in not crisply defining objectives, not setting priorities, and not rigorously linking means to ends.",
  "Weaker minds simply latch onto whatever conventional wisdom and catch phrases are floating around in order to remain minimally functional in the kaleidoscopic setting of most administrations.",
  "That is to say, officials had the mental capacity to get these logical connections right; but they were inclined not to use it in choosing the course of least effort and least resistance.",
  "That’s why the White House cried havoc about North Korea’s threat while the presumed coercive instrument sailed blissfully in the opposite direction heading for an extended shore leave.",
  "This pattern has something to do with uncritical commitment to an inheritance of established national goals which have taken on the aura of self-evident – if not gospel - truth.",
  "Sending more troops to Afghanistan when you’ve failed miserably to achieve your (undefined) objective over the past 15 years with much larger contingents seems to defy reason.",
  "Where little discipline is imposed by the chief, the greater the chances that the result will be contradictory, disjointed, sub-optimal and often poorly executed policies.",
  "A significant increase in American forces along with a mandate to engage directly in combat has been strongly pressed by National Security Advisor (General) H.R.",
  "In so doing, they are perpetuating the set of American policies (in the Greater Middle East) pursued since the “war on terror’s” initiation in 2001.",
  "The premise is that they had an accurate, unbiased understanding while Johnson was a chronic liar who had his political image foremost in mind.",
  "Their lying about capabilities (theirs and the Communists), the battlefield picture, and what was going down politically became proverbial.",
  "Finally, we should recognize that rigorous thinking is far from the norm - at the highest levels of government as well as in everyday life.",
  "They are acutely aware of how much the image of the uniformed military suffered as a result of America losing its first war in Vietnam.",
  "Failure, as perceived in the public eye, could tarnish the resplendent image so successfully cultivated during the “war on terror” era.",
  "The inclination to avoid acquiring knowledge about a matter either at hand or looming is not necessarily a sign of stupidity.",
  "That could translate into less support for bigger budgets, less lucrative consultancies after retirement, and less acclaim.",
  "This latest attempt to fashion a Taliban-free Afghanistan raises the question of how rational is American foreign policy.",
  "The daily briefing at command headquarters in Saigon was universally called the “5 O’clock Follies” by the press corps.",
  "He did not help his reputation by suppressing Intelligence estimates regarding the size of the forces confronting him.",
  "True, when practiced and reinforced, rigorous thinking can become habitual – just like other modes of human behavior.",
  "That modus operandi doesn’t fly in the Middle East or in dealing with the likes of Vladimir Putin or Xia Jinping.",
  "At that stage in the flight from rationality, being lauded as “the best brain in the Army” promises no salvation.",
  "A second reality to keep in mind is that governments are plural nouns – or, pronouns with multiple antecedents.",
  "It follows that they might hope against hope that the outcome can be fudged enough so as to escape that fate.",
  "The top United States’ commanders in Vietnam were as blind to realities as were the civilians in Washington.",
  "One is that there exists an implicit logic that is not acknowledged but salient for the person(s) involved.",
  "There are multiple influences, though, that militate against that habit taking root and being sustained.",
  "What of senior policy-makers in and around the White House who do not share those particular interests?",
  "Has McMaster observed the lessons that he drew from his study of the military’s Vietnam experience?",
  "A stubborn unwillingness to accept responsibility and to be held accountable exacerbates matters.",
  "Is this another senseless gesture in the endless “war on terror?” What is the underlying logic?",
  "The Trump administration is on the brink of making decision on another ‘surge” in Afghanistan.",
  "What seems to count is that they do not want the U.S. military to be stigmatized as a failure.",
  "The conventional soldier epitomized, Westmoreland never understood what he was up against.",
  "“Willful ignorance,” or “studied ignorance,” is an increasingly familiar phenomenon.",
  "Yet, there is still no clear statement of aim or measure of (unlikely) success.",
  "McMaster, Secretary of Defense (General) James Mattis, and the Pentagon brass.",
  "Not just in Washington but among heads of large organizations of all stripes.",
  "Vietnam is the central reference point for McMaster’s strategic perspective.",
  "A business career such as Trump’s is not the desired preparation.",
  "It is simply dishonest and runs the risk of self brain-washing.",
  "Is it willful ignorance cum sublimation – yes, in part.",
  "Here, too, there may be hidden considerations at play.",
  "Your policies – if not you individually – are doomed.",
  "Altogether, the tumult can soften the toughest mind.",
  "**\n\nThere is a practical side to this concern, too.",
  "And at the end of the day, he could rig the books.",
  "Think of Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Ukraine.",
  "In careerist, political and organizational terms?",
  "Several explanations, not excuses, come to mind.",
  "It is negligent rather than outright ‘dumb’.",
  "Is that itself an indication of obtuseness?",
  "And a weaker voice in policy debates.",
  "Those goals may well be unrealistic.",
  "This is a very dubious proposition.",
  "How to characterize this behavior?",
  "Is acting in this manner ‘dumb’?",
  "Is it ‘dumb’ to take that risk?",
  "It certainly is short-sighted.",
  "No – just bad judgment.",
  "Strategically, yes.",
  "Quite the opposite.",
  "Is this ignorance?",
  "– perhaps not.",
  "Yes.",
  "No."
