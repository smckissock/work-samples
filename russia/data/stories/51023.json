  "https://t.co/1SksZU9qlj — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2015\n\nDecember 2015: In what became one of the defining moments of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" a proposal that many began colloquially referring to as the \"Muslim ban.\"",
  "Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing \"25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\" and 51% of those polled, \"agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\"",
  "Favoring fiery language and vowing to put \"America first,\" Mr. Trump would regularly criticize his political opponents for appearing soft on terror — but moreover, his vow to ban Muslims from entering the United States both invigorated many among his base, while inflaming his critics.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015\n\nJanuary 2016: Mr. Trump continues to defend his stance on Twitter, in which he criticizes former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's opposition to both his Muslim ban and his proposed border wall.",
  "Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2015\n\nNovember 2015: At a campaign rally in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Trump made the assertion, without evidence, that thousands of people celebrated in Jersey City, N.J. on Sept. 11, 2001.",
  "He doubled down on the claim in a subsequent interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos: \"There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down.",
  "His inflammatory rhetoric on Islam was backed up by two subsequent attempts to implement a travel ban affecting a small number of Muslim-majority countries, both of which were held up by legal challenges.",
  "His language, on the trail and thereafter, has been described by those affected as deeply alienating, as many American Muslims often felt \"otherized,\" and fissures within the American public widened.",
  "The complete text is below:\n\nDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.",
  "And perhaps notably, the Associated Press reports that Mr. Trump's remarks — scripted by Stephen Miller who authored the travel ban — will feature a softening of his rhetoric about Islam.",
  "President Donald Trump's election campaign was notable for many reasons, but one that sits awkwardly with the first country he has chosen to visit as president was his tone toward Islam.",
  "Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.",
  "Later in the month, in wake of the deadly terror attack in Brussels, Belgium, he once again argues that Muslims should not be permitted to \"flow in\" to the United States.",
  "March 2015: Prior to launching his presidential bid, Mr. Trump tweeted about a 2015 Texas shooting outside a contest for Prophet Mohammed cartoons in a Dallas suburb.",
  "- Donald J. Trump\n\nOn the same day his proposed \"Muslim ban\" was unveiled, Mr. Trump publishes a tweet suggesting that there are no Muslim American sports heroes.",
  "Yet ahead of the speech, many of the president's past statements — made in tweets, interviews and off-the-cuff comments at campaign rallies — are being revisited.",
  "Mr. Trump proceeded to share tweets in an attempt to bolster his argument, citing articles from Infowars -- the site run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016\n\nMarch 2016: In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Mr. Trump says: \"I think Islam hates us.",
  "September 2013: Before the extent of his political ambitions were fully known, Mr. Trump was accused on Twitter of \"hating\" Muslims.",
  "Mr. Trump stated, \"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension.",
  "According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.",
  "What would you do if a large group of Muslims had a very public meeting drawing horrible and mocking cartoons of Jesus?",
  "Mr. Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia — Islam's home — this weekend, on the first international trip of the presidency.",
  "In it, however, he said: \"there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\"",
  "On Sunday, he's scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech about radicalism to Arab leaders.",
  "I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY & @realDonaldTrump IS RIGHT: MUSLIMS DID CELEBRATE ON 9/11 HERE!",
  "If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.\"",
  "The statement can no longer be found on Mr. Trump's campaign website.",
  "Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine.",
  "Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes.",
  "to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K.",
  "to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!",
  "What sport is he talking about, and who?",
  "Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K.",
  "There's a tremendous hatred there.\"",
  "He shared a one-word retort.",
  "There's something there.",
  "Is Obama profiling?",
  "Oh really, be cool!",
  "Not good.\"",
  "WE SAW IT!"
