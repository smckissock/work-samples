  "That's especially important as Facebook's flagship social media service continues to experience a slowdown in the growth of its \"ad load\" — the number of ads that Facebook inserts into the newsfeed.",
  "The upshot: The investment bank is pegging its price target for Facebook's stock, which is currently floating around $203, at $215 — and suggests in a best-case scenario it could go as high as $245.",
  "The service recently crossed the 1 billion user milestone, and Morgan Stanley notes that the app's active user growth \"inflected\" in Q2, as Instagram added 750,000 users per day.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nFacebook's reputation has been battered by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but Facebook's business is humming.",
  "In a research note published on Tuesday, Nowak reckons that ads on Instagram will bring in $3.8 billion in revenue in Q2, and as much as $4.5 billion in Q4.",
  "According to the estimates of Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, Instagram will account for 36% of Facebook total ad revenue growth in the second quarter.",
  "But we'll get a sense about how it's doing by assessing the results of Facebook's overall business when it reports its Q2 earnings on July 25.",
  "The ad load slowdown within Facebook is very deliberate; the company is wary of turning consumers off by barraging them with too many ads.",
  "Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd whatever reputational damage Facebook's brand may be suffering, Instagram is more popular than ever with consumers.",
  "Facebook doesn't (yet) break out financial results for Instagram, so it's tough to know precisely how big of a contributor it is.",
  "\"We believe the Street is still underestimating FB's ability to grow even as ad load slows,\" Nowak writes.",
  "Luckily, Facebook has Instagram and its relatively un-monetized fields of content to pick up the slack.",
  "The photo-sharing app is turning into an increasingly important money-maker for Facebook.",
  "One big reason: Instagram."
