  "Asked during their joint press conference about the dinner planned for the Trumps at Jules Verne, the Eiffel Tower’s sky-high restaurant, Macron insisted, “It will be a dinner between friends, because we are the representatives of two countries which have been allies forever and because we've been able to build a strong relation which is dear to me, because it matters a great deal for both countries.”\n\n“I think it is a brilliant coup from Macron who is now Trump's ‘new friend,’ and has put France at the core of Europe's leadership,” said Philippe Le Corre, a visiting fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, in an email.",
  "It’s really worth watching:\n\nThe farewell handshake between President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron lasted about 25 seconds https://t.co/8CfUqfRZ8z pic.twitter.com/ddfJiJDv1i — CNN (@CNN) July 14, 2017\n\nIt’s clear now why Macron invited Trump to celebrate Bastille Day with him in France.",
  "“He doesn’t want to see an isolated America because he then thinks it will defend its interests more aggressively, which will probably be bad for international cooperation in a lot of fields.”\n\nPart of that realism has been to cast a calculated eye to the rest of the European board in play.",
  "But President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have just shared a whirlwind 24-hour love fest in Paris, and the buzz of their ardor and flesh-pressing intimacy has the world reassessing not just the visuals of their relationship but something much more profound.",

  "“So it seems Macron is leveraging his good relationship with Trump to also act as a spokesperson for Europe.”\n\nMacron may be new to politics, but he’s certainly no amateur when it comes to the delicate nuances of handling the American president.",
  "Even better for Macron than just the optics, Gordon noted, was the domestic approval that came with it: According to a recent poll by the French television station BFMTV, 59 percent of the French supported Macron’s Trump outreach efforts.",
  "He has successfully managed to get the ear, and perhaps the heart, of the famously boorish, thin-skinned Trump by appealing to Trump’s love of ceremony, and by abruptly flipping the switch from cold to warm on Franco-American relations.",
  "Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is distracted by the coming German federal elections in September, not to mention what appears to be a distinct distaste for Trump, and Theresa May is caught up in the headaches of Brexit.",
  "Emmanuel Macron has now just successfully positioned himself as Western Europe’s closest American ally, while the rest of Europe’s leaders remain stymied on how to engage with an “America first” isolationist president.",
  "Macron immediately launched a cheekily titled “Make Our Planet Great Again” campaign in which he invited American scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs to move to France and bring their talent and ideas with them.",
  "Alpha males and their lady friends\n\nThe Macron about-face on Trump is a “classic alpha male strategy,” Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me.",
  "The newly elected French president took to Twitter on June 1 to counter Trump the moment he announced he was taking the United States out of the Paris climate accord.",
  "He deeply enjoys military pomp and circumstance, and was reportedly disgruntled to learn he couldn’t add more military honors to his own Inauguration Day festivities.",
  "Being in Paris on Bastille Day, especially on the 100th anniversary of the US involvement in World War I, offered Trump all of his favorite things: Military parade?",
  "Later, Macron would tell the French press it was a purposeful pissing match: “My handshake with him — it wasn’t innocent,” he disclosed to the Journal du Dimanche.",
  "He received Trump warmly, took him on a tour through Napoleon’s tomb, and offered up a Disney-perfect version of Paris — including an Eiffel Tower dinner party.",
  "He wants Trump — and the US — to play a bigger role in the global response to challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and conflicts in places like Syria.",

  "For Trump, all but completely shunned at the G20 summit in Hamburg over his position on climate change, it was surely a welcome adjustment.",
  "Second, from a position of strength, reach out a hand of magnanimous friendship.”\n\nMacron asserted his position of strength early.",
  "There, Macron kept a white-knuckled grip on Trump’s hand for much longer than was necessary, a show of aggressive masculinity.",
  "This hand-and-arm grab took place while Trump’s motorcade waited, ready to whisk the first couple back to Air Force One.",
  "And when he bowed out of the climate accords, Trump boasted he had been elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris.",
  "On the campaign trail, he insisted “Paris was no longer Paris” anymore (due to terror and an influx of outsiders).",
  "After all, just last week Macron announced he would be holding yet another climate conference, in December.",

  "That’s no small thing given that Paris was a city the president has long loved to bash.",
  "“It was a moment of truth.”\n\n“That’s how you ensure you are respected,” he explained.",
  "Macron even got Trump to soften, ever so slightly, on his mulish climate position.",
  "A nostalgic recollection of a bygone era of righteous American military strength?",
  "A warm look back at a time of harmonious friendship between the two countries?",
  "Macron, on the other hand, is fresh to the stage in both France and the world.",
