  "ROGERS: So on the Ukraine side, what we saw was over time, rather than the kind of overt kind of activity we saw to such a degree on the Crimea side, what we saw was a much bigger effort on the influence and attempts to distance Russian actions from any potential blowback to the Russian state, if you will, and hence the use of the little green men surrogates in military -- unmarked military uniforms, the flow of information, the provision of resources to support forcible separation of the Ukraine.",
  "ROGERS: Purely on the basis of exposure, I wanna make sure I understand the question, is -- is...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTURNER: Are you required to cease, if you are -- are undertaking lawful collection under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of a person or individual, either because they're a foreign person located outside the United States or the person that you're collecting against, is the subject of a FISA Court order.",
  "So the same month that Trump denied Putin's role in Ukraine, his team weakened the party platform on Ukraine and as we have and will continue to hear, this was the same month that several individuals in the Trump orbit held secret meetings with Russian officials, some of which may have been on the topic of sanctions against Russia or their intervention in Ukraine.",
  "I mean, a big difference to me in the past was while there was cyber activity, we never saw in previous presidential elections information being published on such a massive scale that had been illegally removed both from private individuals as well as organizations associated with the democratic process both inside the government and outside the government.",
  "Now Admiral, as you know that the foreign service -- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides the circumstances or the authority under which the intelligence community may collect or intercept the communication of a foreign person located outside of the United States, or as Mr. Comey's indicated a person who is covered under a FISA court order.",
  "And following on Congressman LoBiondo's questions and based on this theme, I'd like to ask you gentlemen if you could describe what, if anything, Russia did in this election that to your knowledge they did or they didn't do in previous elections, how -- how it was -- were their actions different in this election than -- than in previous ones.",
  "COMEY: Again, you'd have to ask an expert, but from my general knowledge it's to punish activities that are criminal in nature, that involve war crimes, that involve violations of U.N. resolutions or United States law in some other way, it's to communicate and enforce foreign policy interests and values of United States of America.",
  "I mean we have stated previously, from an intelligence perspective, we tried to -- we have tried to outline to policy makers the specifics of the Russian invasion on Crimea, the specifics of the continued Russian support to separatists in the Ukraine that Russians continue to -- to pressure and the keep the Ukraine weak.",
  "So can you, either Director Comey or Admiral Rogers,\n\n\n\ntell us what we are doing or what we should be doing to protect against Russian interference in future elections or any meddling with our government or for that matter any state sponsor Iranians, North Koreans, Chinese, with any -- any meddling they may be doing?",
  "We're working closely, we -- our FBI teammates, others working closely with our European teammates to provide the insights that we have seen to try to assist them as they, themselves, France and Germany for example, about to undergo significant national leadership elections over the course of the next two months.",
  "I mean, we saw several, if you will, common traits that we have both seen over time as well as I would argue that the difference this time was that the -- the cyber dimension and the fact that the release of so much information that they had extracted via cyber is a primary tool to try to drive an outcome.",
  "So Mr. Rogers, is the intelligence community required to cease collection or the interception of communications if the result of the collection or interception includes the communications of an incoming U.S. administration official, the president-elect or the president- elect's transition team.",
  "ROGERS: I fully expect them to continue this -- this level of activity because I -- our sense is that they have come to the conclusion that it generated a positive outcome for them in the sense that calling into question the democratic process for example is one element of the strategy.",
  "Because that is my question, are you under any circumstances required to cease collection if the collection results in the either inadvertent or incidental collection of an incoming U.S. administration official, the president-elect or the president-elect's transition team?",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: And this massive amount and this loudness, now that it's become public knowledge, now that we have perhaps satisfied their -- their -- their thirst that it has become such a huge deal, do you expect their interference to be amplified in future U.S. elections?",
  "And they'll be in 2020, they may be back in 2018 and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sewed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process.",
  "Understanding that what both of you have been saying about the classified nature of the investigation, the classified nature of the topics we're talking about, can you give us any indication of when we, the committee, may in a classified setting know something from you.",
  "ROGERS: I'd say the biggest difference from my perspective was both the use of cyber, the hacking as a vehicle to physically gain access to information to extract that information and then to make it widely, publicly available without any alteration or change.",
  "ROGERS: So you see some of the same things that we saw in the U.S. in terms of disinformation, fake news, attempts to release of information to embarrass individuals, you're seeing that play out to some extent in European elections right now.",
  "I think as you've looked to what this committee is undertaking, everyone wants answers and everyone want answers to all of the questions that are being asked because this does go to such an important issue concerning our elections.",
  "ROGERS: It depends under what authority work, as I said early on, there's a series of questions we go through, was there criminal associated activity, does the conversation deal about threats to U.S. persons, breaking of the law.",
  "So my question to you Director Comey is, is it of value to President Putin knowing what you know of him and that his interest in doing harm to us, is it of benefit to Mr. Putin to have Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State?",
  "CARSON: Now according to NATO analysis, the Russian economy shrunk by as much as 3.5 percent in 2015 and had no growth in 2016 in big part because of western sanctions, especially those against the oil and gas industry.",
  "Now, with Mr. Rooney and Mr. Gowdy you discussed the minimization procedures under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and those minimization procedures are supposed to protect the privacy rights of U.S. citizens.",
  "[12:30:05]\n\n\n\nKING: Well, if they're listening, I would just advise that Director Clapper and Director Brennan, we'll be asking them the same questions last week -- next week and perhaps, they can give us some answers.",
  "We traditionally viewed critical infrastructure as something that generated an industrial output, aviation, electricity, finance, I don't think we've traditionally thought about it and informational kind of dynamic.",
  "I think part -- their number one mission is to undermine the credibility of our entire democracy enterprise of this nation and so it might be that they wanted us to help them by telling people what they were doing.",
  "In fact, the dossier written by former MI6 agent, Christopher Steele alleges that Trump agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue, which is effectively a priority for Vladimir Putin.",
  "Their loudness, in a way, would be counting on us to amplify it by telling the American people what we saw and freaking people out about how the Russians might be undermining our elections successfully.",
  "Specifically, it's geared toward the communications of those who maybe inadvertently or incidentally collected as a result of the intelligence community's lawful collection of communications of others.",
  "But I want to assure the American people that there's also bipartisan agreement on getting to the bottom of Russian meddling in our election which must remain the focus of this investigation and yours.",
  "LOBIONDO: So as the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are conducting our bipartisan investigations and looking wherever it may lead with individuals or circumstances.",
  "We also, as a government, supplied information to all the states so they could equip themselves to make sure there was no successful effort to affect the vote and there was none, as we said earlier.",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: And what specifically based on this loudness did the FBI or the NSA do to prevent or counter this Russian active measure that we read about in the intelligence community assessment?",
  "LOBIONDO: So just for the record, I also had a whole list of specific questions about individuals and/or circumstances that don't want to be repetitive and have you say, I can't comment on them.",
  "I think that's a challenge for us coming ahead and then continued partnership between the elements within the government, as well is in the private sector, that's the key to the future to me.",
  "SCHIFF: I'd make a request through you to the Justice Department or whatever IC component would have custody of Mr. Flynn's SF86, I'd make a request that that be provided to the committee.",
  "And I agree with you Director Comey, when you say this investigation that is ongoing, we will follow the facts wherever they lead on a bipartisan level and there will be no sacred cows.",
  "CARSON: Now this was a time where much of the world was united but Russia invaded another country and illegally annexed it's territory as we all stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine.",
  "ROGERS: Now we're starting to get into some very technical questions\n\n\n\nabout are the Russians physically in the Ukraine, is it surrogates that the Crimea is a very example of to me.",
  "It's never acceptable, we can all agree, for any foreign power to interfere with our electoral process and this committee has long been focused on Russia's reprehensible conduct.",
  "COMEY: Well, among other things, we alerted people who had been victims of intrusions to permit them to tighten their systems to see if they couldn't kick the Russian actors out.",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: And in terms of the European elections, what -- what have you seen or any information that you can share with us about the Russian interference in that process?",
  "ROGERS: So we saw cyber used, we saw the use of external media, we saw the use of disinformation, we saw the use of leaking of information, much of which was not altered.",
  "They engaged in a multifaceted campaign of active measures to undermine our democracy and hurt one of the candidates and -- and hope to help one of the other candidates.",
  "In terms of how we harden our defenses, I think we also need to have a discussion about just what for example, does critical infrastructure meeting in the 21st-century.",
  "ROGERS: So first, I think a public discussion and acknowledgment of the activity is a good positive first step because it shines us a flashlight on this, if you will.",
  "But I would anticipate when we move to classified session that this committee will be able to explore some of those -- some of the situations in a little more depth.",
  "COMEY: It's the standard background clearance form that all of us who are hired by the federal government and want to have access to classified information fill out.",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: And the loudness to which you refer, perhaps they were doing these kinds of actions previously in other elections but they were not doing it as loudly.",
  "If you, through the FBI investigation, come across a circumstance with an individual or a situation would we be made aware of that under normal course of business?",
  "There is bipartisan agreement on the danger of illegal leaks and our ability to reauthorize important programs upon which our intelligence community relies.",
  "In 2008, he said that the likelihood of U.S./Russia businesses was, in fact, a poor investment, that Russia was a poor investment climate, that was in 2008.",
  "I actually think that their engagement was an act of war, an act of hybrid warfare and I think that's why the American people should be concerned about it.",
  "And I believe it was Director Clapper and then-secretary Jeh Johnson issued a statement saying this is what the Russians are doing, sort of an inoculation.",
  "CARSON: Am I right, sir, that they see it as a part of their broader objective to influence and impact Russia's -- Ukraine's desire for self-determination?",
  "You know, most in our country recognize what is at stake in how the United States, as the leader of the free world, is the only check on Russian expansion.",
  "So in 2014 at Igor Sechin is sanctioned and he laments that he no longer will be able to come to the United States to motorcycle ride with Mr. Tillerson.",
  "SPEIER: So in the case of Igor's session, who was sanctioned by the United States, in part to draw attention to the fact that Russia had invaded Crimea.",
  "That's a huge sum of money and sanctions aren't meant to push their economy over a cliff, but to put long-term pressure on Putin to change his behavior.",
  "\n\n\n\nReturn to Transcripts main page\n\nINSIDE POLITICS\n\nThe House Questions Director Comey and Admiral RogersAbout Russian Involvement in US Election.",
  "We've only got 35 seconds, but that's the first thing I want to get into about exactly what they were doing if you can tell us anything about that.",
  "At the republican convention in July, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Trump himself changed the republican party platform to no longer arm Ukraine.",
  "So Admiral Rogers, I agree in what you said that a public acknowledgement of this foreign meddling to be a problem is important as we move forward.",
  "CARSON: Sir, as Russia tried to claim stolen territory in Ukraine, the U.S. and the rest of the world saw the annexation for what it was; a crime.",
  "Do you see any evidence of that in European elections or do you think that this public acknowledgment would -- would tamper down the volatility?",
  "In 2012, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Sechin go on a road show here in the United States to talk about this great deal that they had just consummated.",
  "Mr. Comey, Admiral Rogers, thank you for being here today and for your -- what appears to be attempts at being forthcoming with the committee.",
  "The CEO of Rosneft is Igor Sechin, who is a confident of President Putin, second most powerful man in Russia and probably a former KGB agent.",
  "So would you say that Russia engaged in hybrid warfare in its effort to undermine our Democratic process and engage in our electoral process?",
  "You know, I think it's really important as we sit here that we explain this to the American people in a way that they can understand it.",
  "In March 2014, Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea beginning a conflict which has effectively yet to be resolved.",
  "There's a lot in the dossier that is yet to be proven, but increasingly as we'll hear throughout the day, allegations are checking out.",
  "And I would include those like Roger Stone and Carter Page and Michael Caputo and Wilbur Ross and Paul Manafort and Rex Tillerson.",
  "But as your work goes on, we're in constant touch with you and we'll do the best we can, but I can't commit to that as I sit here.",
  "I have briefed the committee as a whole on some aspects of our work and I've briefed in great detail the chair and the ranking.",
  "So very briefly the -- if you can describe the elements of the Russia's active measures in the campaign in the 2016 election.",
  "And in 2013, Mr. Tillerson receives the Russian Order of Friendship and he sits right next to President Putin at the event.",
  "In our own government, recognizing the seriousness of the event instituted new sanctions against Russia, is that right sir?",
  "And the tarantula, in my view, is Vladimir Putin, who is entrapping many people to do his bidding and to engage with him.",
  "It's almost as if they didn't care that we knew what they were doing or that they wanted us to see what they were doing.",
  "In fact, there is also one pattern I wanna point out before yielding back, Manafort, fired, Page, fired, Flynn, fired.",
  "On July 30, in an interview with ABC News, Mr. Trump said of Putin, and I quote, \"He's not going into Ukraine, OK?",
  "Now, in -- in terms of trying to understand this, I -- I think of a spider web, with a tarantula in the middle.",
  "Admiral Rogers, I'm going to begin with a question to you concerning the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
  "Shortly after Russia invaded, the United Nations essentially declared it a crime in a nonbinding resolution.",
  "Could you give me an understanding of what are some of the reasons that we impose sanctions, Direct Comey?",
  "SCHIFF: Would that SF86 require that the applicant disclose any payments received from a foreign power?",
  "They're an adversary and so they wanna resist us, oppose us, undermine us, in lots of different ways.",
  "I'm going to yield myself 15 minutes and now yield to the general lady from Florida Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.",
  "It's possible they're misreading that as it worked and so we'll come back and hit them again in 2020.",
  "Admiral Rogers, can you please briefly describe, as you understand it, sir, how Russia took Crimea?",
  "ROGERS: Sir, I'm not -- I'm not in a position to talk broadly about the geopolitical implications.",
  "Also in 2012 there's a video of President Putin and Mr. Tillerson toasting champagne at the deal.",
  "TURNER: Mr. Rogers, is there any provision of minimization that requires you to cease collection?",
  "The deal gives Exxon access to the Black Sea and the Kara Seas and Siberia for oil development.",
  "It's also a tool that we use to attempt to drive and shake the choices and actions of others.",
  "ROGERS: They're certainly supporting the ongoing effort in the Ukraine to split that country.",
  "So I think after we hear Mr. Quigley's line of questioning, we might guess who could be next.",
  "There's a variety ongoing efforts both within the government, as well, in the private sector.",
  "I don't think we traditionally would have thought of an election infrastructure as critical.",
  "SCHIFF: Would someone who is an incoming national security advisor have to fill out an SF86?",
  "Now, we're talking about a loss of over $135 billion just in the first year of sanctions.",
  "ROGERS: We're talking about the Crimea and influence on the Ukraine generally, yes, sir.",
  "Director Comey, Admiral Rogers, thank you for your service and thank you for being here.",
  "First, tell me sir, what would it mean to Russia and to Putin to have sanctions lifted?",
  "Now, Admiral, hadn't Putin already gone into Ukraine two years before and hadn't left?",
  "ROGERS: I'm sure in their view they view this is a primary national interest for them.",
  "I have a couple of other questions about the -- about the -- the Russian intervention.",
  "LOBIONDO: So in this setting, can you talk to us at all about what\n\n\n\ntools they used?",
  "ROGERS: Clearly, even easing of economic impact, greater flexibility, more resources.",
  "It illuminates a significant issue that I think we all have to -- have to deal with.",
  "Mr. Chairman, if you could give me a couple minutes when we get to the next round.",
  "ROGERS: They intend to ensure, I believe, that they gain advantage at our expense.",
  "However, because their connections became public, they were effectively culpable.",
  "It's an effort to try and send a very strong message to Russia, is that not true?",
  "COMEY: The only thing I'd add is they were unusually loud in their intervention.",
  "What -- why do you think that they did not mind being loud and being found out?",
  "Now one person who didn't see it that way, however, was president Donald Trump.",
  "So there's no simple yes or no, there's a series of processes we have in place.",
  "ROGERS: I'm not going to go into the specifics of how they executed the hacks.",
  "Aired 12:30-1p ET\n\nAired March 20, 2017 - 12:30 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.",
  "COMEY: I'll let my -- maybe I'll just say as initial matter they'll be back.",
  "I'd like to focus first on Rex Tillerson in the three minutes I have, here.",
  "CARSON: Sir, we've heard terms like little green men and hybrid\n\n\n\nwarfare.",
  "I'd like to focus my line of questioning on Russia's views toward Ukraine.",
  "CARSON: There's a lot of steak -- there's a lot at stake here for Russia.",
  "Putin, himself, said in 2016 that sanctions are severely harming Russia.",
  "Are we looking at a new iron curtain descending across Eastern Europe?",
  "They were hired because of their Russian connections, they were fired.",
  "ROGERS: Ma'am I'm not -- I'm not in the position answer that question.",
  "There are many important issues at stake, as you gentlemen have heard.",
  "And so that might have been part of their plan, I don't know for sure.",
  "That's my general sense, but an expert might describe it much better.",
  "It blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyber warfare.",
  "They outright invaded with armed military force and have annexed it.",
  "So we know they've had success in putting pressure on the Kremlin.",
  "I think you'd -- you'd wanna ask experts in the definition of war.",
  "They occupied it and physically removed it from Ukrainian control.",
  "NUNES: Gentleman yields back...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nKING: Thank you.",
  "CARSON: Admiral, has Russia returned Crimea back to Ukraine, sir?",
  "SPEIER: So one of the terms that we hear often is hybrid warfare.",
  "And I'd like to just stand give a short definition of what it is.",
  "Just so you understand, he's not going into Ukraine, all right?\"",
  "So my first question to each of you is, is Russia our adversary?",
  "I also want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member Schiff.",
  "I don't know -- I can't -- I can't predict or commit to updates.",
  "If they can legitimate their annexation of Crimea, what's next?",
  "CARSON: Would it help cleave the United States from her allies?",
  "And we will remain focused on the threat emanating from Moscow.",
  "It was very noisy, their intrusions in different institutions.",
  "Rosneft gets minority interest in Exxon in Texas and the Gulf.",
  "COMEY: Mr. LoBiondo, I don't know how long the work will take.",
  "Can you please explain how these relate to Russia and Ukraine?",
  "And then the government as a whole in October called it out.",
  "The aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution.",
  "THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.",
  "CARSON: Admiral, why does Russia even care about Ukraine?",
  "In 2011 he closed the $500 billion deal with Rosneft Oil.",
  "SPEIER: With that, Mr. Chairman, I'll yield back for now.",
  "I don't know but we have to assume they're coming back.",
  "COMEY: Yes, I wanna be -- harm can have many meetings.",
  "ROGERS: I would argue the insertion of military force.",
  "But I don't have enough time to get into it right now.",
  "As loud as they were, what did we do to counter that?",
  "It's on the immediate periphery of the Russian state.",
  "SCHIFF: I yield the balance to Representative Speier.",
  "Thank you gentlemen for your service to our country.",
  "Would it help legitimate Russia's illegal land grab?",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: I look forward to continuing with you.",
  "ROGERS: They publicly indicated that they will not.",
  "LOBIONDO: We'll try to get into that in classified.",
  "CARSON: But are they effectively still in Ukraine?",
  "And this one seems to be as accurate as they come.",
  "COMEY: I don't think I would use the term warfare.",
  "CARSON: We'll get back to Mr. Trump in a minute.",
  "Director Comey, can you tell me what an SF86 is?",
  "CARSON: And he still hasn't left, correct, sir?",
  "This is big money, big strategic implications.",
  "ROS-LEHTINEN: Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.",
  "ROGERS: I would echo the Director's comments.",
  "ROGERS: I've -- I agree with Director Comey.",
  "SPEIER: Is -- do they intend to do us harm?",
  "Admiral, what would it mean geopolitically?",
  "COMEY: Not necessarily, but it's possible.",
  "Now this is no coincidence in my opinion.",
  "Rex Tillerson calls Sechin a good friend.",
  "SPEIER: All right, well, thank you both.",
  "COMEY: I don't know the answer for sure.",
  "I just had a couple follow-up questions.",
  "Mr. Schiff's recognized for 15 minutes.",
  "I can't commit to updates, as you know.",
  "I think so and foreign travel as well.",
  "Why are we talking about all of this?",
  "So back to Mr. Trump and his cohort.",
  "ROGERS: I'd agree with the director.",
  "COMEY: I can't answer that question.",
  "ROGERS: If we remove the sanctions?",
  "CARSON: Do they have intentions to?",
  "CARSON: Thank you, Ranking Member.",
  "NUNES: Mr. Lobiondo is recognized.",
  "LOBIONDO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "NUNES: (OFF-MIKE)\n\n\n\nLOBIONDO: OK.",
  "SPEIER: Thank you, Ranking Member.",
  "But they were also the fall guys.",
  "I'll hold off for now, thank you.",
  "SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "Mr. Chairman, I -- I yield back.",
  "Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.",
  "TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "NUNES: Gentlelady yields back.",
  "He was the CEO of Exxon Mobil.",
  "SPEIER: Well, just in general.",
  "And I yield now to Mr. Carson.",
  "Would we have ongoing updates?",
  "I mean, the form is the form.",
  "NUNES: Gentleman yields back.",
  "NUNES: Gentleman yields back.",
  "Ranking Member, I yield back.",
  "COMEY: I think that's right.",
  "This is a bipartisan effort.",
  "I think that's part of it.",
  "Mr. Turner is recognized.",
  "Thank you for testifying.",
  "COMEY: Yes, I think so.",
  "SPEIER: Director Comey?",
  "SPEIER: Admiral Rogers?",
  "SPEIER: Admiral Rogers?",
  "I apologize, no sir.",
  "SPEIER: Mr. Rogers?",
  "SPEIER: All right.",
  "ROGERS: Yes ma'am.",
  "COMEY: I think so.",
  "COMEY: On Sechin?",
  "Mr. Chairman, Mr.",
  "ROGERS: Yes sir.",
  "Director Comey?",
  "LOBIONDO: OK.",
  "COMEY: SF86?",
  "SCHIFF: Yes.",
  "ROGERS: Yes.",
  "ROGERS: Yes.",
  "COMEY: Yes.",
  "ROGERS: No.",
  "Mr. Comey?",
  "end quote.",
  "Why?"
