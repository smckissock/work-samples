  "Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don’t exist – They will both be out of business in 7 years!”\n\nI have to give it to POTUS: that was funny!",
  "Late last week, The Washington Post first broke the story that Twitter “suspended more than 70 million accounts in May and June” for abusing the platform, primarily for spreading propaganda.",
  "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore Eyes More Dollars\n\nAccording to Zacks.com, advertising revenue accounts for roughly 86% of Twitter’s total revenue.",
  "Expect a Muted Response Towards Twitter Stock\n\nNot everyone was displeased to see Twitter’s troubles, most notably its most famous (and infamous) active-user.",
  "Not only is the company reporting its second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings report on July 27, Twitter is in the middle of a convincing recovery.",
  "Account Suspensions Are a Footnote, Not a Fork\n\nIn the bigger picture, I believe most people will look back at this incident as a minor blip.",
  "Ever since the controversial 2016 presidential election, social-media firms have been under the gun for facilitating disinformation campaign.",
  "The latest company to take a public-relations hit is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which was exposed for its recent “clean-up” efforts.",
  "Additionally, management focused on tighter controls on its financials, keeping expenses in line with revenue trajectory.",
  "On the other hand, management demonstrably proved that they take this issue seriously, and will do anything to stop it.",
  "Both Twitter and especially Facebook faced congressional pressure regarding a Kremlin-backed disinformation offensive.",
  "The Cambridge Analytica fiasco hurt Facebook for just indirectly and inadvertently aiding President Trump’s campaign.",
  "That’s a phenomenally large figure, representing nearly 21% of the company’s 336 million monthly active users (MAUs).",
  "Second, the pivotal reason why TWTR stock has enjoyed a robust recovery over the past year is recent sales growth.",
  "And while I’m sure most Americans are rolling their eyes, we can all take an indirect lesson from our President.",
  "Trump added some levity to the situation, tweeting:\n\n“Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace.",
  "This reminds me of Facebook’s politically-charged controversy involving data-research firm Cambridge Analytica.",
  "This is the core reason why Twitter and rivals Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) emphasize MAU growth.",
  "Obviously, more eyeballs lead to greater, meaningful engagement, and less traffic on competing platforms.",
  "That’s because no advertising company wants to invest their dollars on fake traffic and automated bots.",
  "Not helping matters is that the Post asserts the suspension efforts are still gaining momentum in July.",
  "Combined, these strategies resulted in Twitter posting two consecutive quarters of positive earnings.",
  "First, the clean-up efforts are a net positive for Twitter, and perhaps the social-media industry.",
  "With its earnings report mere weeks away, the natural concern is the impact towards Twitter stock.",
  "But the issue isn’t about raw numbers per say, but their implications towards Twitter’s business.",
  "But in the end, management will send the message to advertisers that their eyeballs are genuine.",
  "But critically, increased MAUs provide confidence to advertisers that their money is well-spent.",
  "Reactionary individuals responded with the #DeleteFacebook campaign, but it got nowhere.",
  "Moreover, it’s not the time to dramatically change your thesis on Twitter stock.",
  "Twitter has suspended accounts at a rate of a million per day in recent months.",
  "As our own Thomas Scarlett stated, Facebook’s “fundamentals are still strong.”",
  "This controversy is probably not going to be as bad as initial fears suggest.",
  "It’s not a fork in the road where you must decide the fate of your portfolio.",
  "Eliminating junk accounts has no bearing on Twitter’s fundamental progress.",
  "Indeed, as I mentioned above, the suspensions are a positive development.",
  "On one hand, the amount of trolling or malicious accounts is staggering.",
  "It’s significant enough to include in a footnote, but that’s about it.",
  "The other headwind weighing on Twitter stock is public perception.",
  "Thus, Twitter investors have legitimate concerns of a backlash.",
  "At this immediate juncture, that confidence is likely shaken.",
  "Yes, the company will be under greater scrutiny.",
  "The timing also couldn’t be worse."
