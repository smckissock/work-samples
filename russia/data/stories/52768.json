  "On the campaign level, the operative continued, “the DCCC has shared best practices, but most campaigns haven’t crossed that line yet where they think they need it.”\n\nSome particularly high-profile politicians are taking stronger measures, like retaining CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm used by the DNC and DCCC to respond to hacks in 2016.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nHouse Democrats’ top strategists have urged consultants working on their campaigns to start using Wickr, the end-to-end encrypted messaging app used inside the DCCC — but the consulting community has been slow to give up email and embrace the program, say three Democratic consultants involved in House races.",

  "Much of the Democratic Party’s permanent apparatus has already changed its day-to-day operations as a result, while beginning the slow process of persuading its decentralized, startup-like campaign ecosystem to follow suit.",
  "Later in the 2018 election cycle, the DCCC will ask candidates to share their own highly sensitive “self-research” — opposition research done against themselves to help the campaign and the party prepare for attacks.",
  "Higher Ground Labs, the incubator for Democratic tech firms founded this year, is looking at options to invest in cybersecurity projects, though it hasn’t made any yet, according to a source familiar with the group.",
  "Security measures vary widely from race to race, leaving many still vulnerable to hacking, and members of both parties say they are seeking centralized clearinghouses of anti-hacking information and services.",
  "A spokesman for McAuliffe, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, declined to comment on whether his PAC retained CrowdStrike as a prophylactic measure or in response to a specific incident.",
  "Illinois Democrat J.B. Pritzker, who is running in what’s expected to be the nation’s most expensive gubernatorial race ever, hired the firm as he launched his campaign in the spring.",
  "The political world is officially obsessed with cybersecurity in 2017 — especially the Democrats burned by the hacking of their committees and operatives during the 2016 election.",
  "The DNC has also started a cybersecurity advisory board to stop hacking and is expected to roll out a “campaign toolkit” that will be available to candidates across the country.",

  "Change is really tough, and email is the central funnel.”\n\nA DCCC aide called it “irresponsible” for top consultants not to use encrypted messaging.",
  "The DCCC, another 2016 victim, moved its internal communication off email and onto Wickr, as have the DSCC and the Democratic Governors Association.",
  "There’s no clearinghouse,” said Michael Ambler, campaign manager for the gubernatorial campaign of Democratic Maine Attorney General Janet Mills.",
  "The committee ran seminars at which outside Democratic operatives taught them to use Wickr — but many are still using email on their campaigns.",
  "And some candidates who watched what happened in 2016 have made hacking and security a topic when political consultants come in for interviews.",
  "“There’s no recommendation on our side,” said Republican consultant Brad Todd, a top strategist on Senate and House races around the country.",
  "The Democratic committees that were breached in 2016 have been especially eager to install stronger hacking protections this year.",
  "“I will say that we have a full-time cybersecurity team on staff,” NRCC communications director Matt Gorman said in an email.",
  "Chairman Tom Perez is among a growing number of political figures using the secure messaging app Signal, BuzzFeed reported.",

  "It was one of the add-on ‘Oh yeah, campaign security’” sessions.”",
  "“I just don’t think there’s anyone whose job it is, really.",
