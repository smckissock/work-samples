  "Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don’t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).” And even if the Russian government did hack the DNC, some, like journalist and activist Glenn Greenwald, caution against concluding too quickly that Russia invented Guccifer 2.0.",
  "In July, the Hill also published some DNC documents, writing, “Guccifer 2.0, the hacker who breached the Democratic National Committee, has released a cache of purported DNC documents to The Hill in an effort to refocus attention on the hack.”\n\nBut CrowdStrike was always skeptical of Guccifer 2.0.",
  "Though it is difficult to definitively determine the source of sophisticated cyberattacks, the firm said it had strong forensic evidence that both hacking groups were tied to the Russian government, and it published its findings in a June report.",
  "The firm concluded, though, that the the evidence is sketchy:\n\nThere appears to be strong, yet still circumstantial, evidence supporting the assertions that Guccifer 2.0 is part of a [denial and deception] campaign, and not an independent actor.",

  "Edward Snowden pointed out on Monday that the National Security Agency probably has bulk surveillance of Web traffic surrounding the hack and could likely produce independent metadata pointing to the real culprit or culprits.",
  "It wouldn’t be hard to imagine that an embarrassed Democratic Party is simply seizing on the Russian explanation as a way to distract and deflect from the deeply problematic DNC behavior exposed by the leaks.",
  "Before WikiLeaks published the DNC files, he wrote on Medium, “It’s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method.",
  "Regardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community.",
  "CrowdStrike said from the beginning that it had discovered two hacking groups lurking on the DNC’s networks—one that had been there for more than a year and one that had cropped up recently.",
  "The most compelling arguments for this conclusion are the previously identified Russian D&D campaigns, coupled with remaining questions related to Guccifer 2.0’s persona and backstory.",
  "The contents of the emails rocked the DNC, led to chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation, and created a potentially damaging climate for Hillary Clinton’s presidential run.",
  "The Clinton campaign, which itself was also allegedly breached by Russian hackers, has said that it believes Russia was behind the hacks, and Nancy Pelosi is on board, too.",
  "Whether or not this [Guccifer 2.0 WordPress] posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’ authenticity and origin.",

  "An additional narrative has emerged, exploring potential ties and sympathies between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "Advertisement\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Michael Buratowski, a senior vice president at Fidelis, wrote in June, “Based on our comparative analysis we agree with CrowdStrike.",
  "Snowden added, though, that the office of the Director of National Intelligence generally doesn’t weigh in or offer assistance on these types of investigations.",
  "CrowdStrike concluded that one network intruder was linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service and the other to the GRU military intelligence group.",
  "One firm, ThreatConnect, laid out the evidence on both sides and put extensive energy into attempting to prove that Guccifer 2.0 is a real hacker.",
  "The idea was that WikiLeaks could publish a decryption key if it ever wanted people to access the trove (which is probably the stolen DNC files).",
  "The DNC announced in June that it had been hacked and was working with the well-known security firm CrowdStrike to investigate the breach.",
  "Multiple prominent CrowdStrike competitors, including Mandiant and Fidelis Cybersecurity, independently confirmed CrowdStrike’s findings.",
  "And the leaker seemingly wanted to inject a little chaos into the Democratic National Convention, given the timing of the WikiLeaks post.",
