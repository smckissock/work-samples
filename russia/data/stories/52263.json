  "Even CrowdStrike’s CEO said, as paraphrased by the Post, that it is “extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as Russia.”\n\n“Within 24 hours, CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how,” the Post reported — all before, according to Brazile, the DNC’s own officers were informed of the breach by staff or by the Perkins Coie law firm.",
  "She claimed she had never been informed of the FBI’s offer and said the FBI was the one who did not loop in high-level officials, saying it did not “do anything other than lob a phone call into our tech support through our main switchboard.”\n\n“How is it that the FBI or DHS or any federal agency that was concerned about a foreign enemy state intruding on the networks of one of the two major political parties did not think it important enough to go higher than a tech support staffer?” she asked.",
  "Not long after the breach became public, Capitol Police informed her that her longtime House IT staffer Imran Awan was a criminal suspect for “data transfer violations.” But she lashed out at the Capitol Police and kept Awan on staff, even adding his wife to the payroll, and hired an outside lawyer to prevent authorities from examining equipment tied to Awan.",

  "Brazile’s report on the timing of DNC officials learning about the breach raises questions about why Wasserman Schultz was not engaged in immediate high-level discussions with the DNC’s officers about the breach, which she has characterized as “an all-out assault on American democracy” carried out by a foreign government.",

  "REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, did not tell the DNC’s own officers about a breach on its servers for more than a month after learning about it, according to then-DNC officer Donna Brazile.",
  "In the Post’s June 2016 article Wasserman Schultz characterized the decision-making around the breach as “we,” saying “When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately.",

  "The DNC instead enlisted the law firm of Perkins Coie to make major decisions, including how to handle the breach of its servers that led to an embarrassing email dump.",
