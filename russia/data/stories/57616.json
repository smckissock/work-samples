  "In response to Speier's comments that there's a \"great deal of open source documentation\" that backs up her allegations of potential money laundering, Stewart said, \"I would invite her to bring it before the committee and let us examine it because we haven't seen that at this point.\"",
  "When pressed on what evidence she has to back up her assertion, Speier said she believes that there's other possible evidence of money laundering besides the Simpson transcript, pointing to a \"great deal of open source documentation about a lot of these deals.\"",
  "The transcript shows that Simpson said Fusion GPS was investigating Trump's real estate deals and suspicions of money laundering through Russian officials before the firm hired ex-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele to compile the dossier.",
  "In that interview, Simpson defended the crafting of the now-infamous opposition research dossier and detailed the connections his firm found between the Trump world and Russia, according to a transcript released by the committee on Thursday.",
  "\"I think there is plenty of evidence to suggest that there has been money laundering going on in many of the real estate deals that were done by the Trump Organization,\" Speier said in an interview Thursday on CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"",
  "When CNN's Chris Cuomo asked what real estate had to do with their core investigative mission, Speier said she believes the alleged money laundering activity is connected to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",
  "US law enforcement and intelligence officials have said US investigators did their own work, separate from the dossier, to support their findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump.",
  "In general, while the most salacious allegations in the dossier haven't been verified, its broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community.",
  "Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's chief counsel, told Reuters that the deals Simpson referenced mainly involved properties to which Trump licensed his name, as opposed to owning, developing or selling them.",
  "CNN has also reported that US investigators have corroborated some aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did actually take place.",
  "Following the release of the Simpson transcript, California Rep. Adam Schiff said it reveals \"serious allegations that the Trump Organization may have engaged in money laundering with Russian nationals.\"",
  "The Democratic congresswoman asserted that \"money laundering is a huge component\" of the closed-door interview the House Intelligence Committee had with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson in November.",
  "(CNN) California Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, is making the accusation that past Trump Organization real estate deals show evidence of money laundering.",
  "\"I can't speak to what the special counsel is doing, but the special counsel has a wide discretion to look at any number of things, so it could very well be part of what he's looking at,\" Speier said.",
  "\"The fact that the Russian ties to the Trump Organization were so strong and then coincidentally you have the Russians interfering in our election, it all becomes very, very disturbing,\" Speier said.",
  "CNN has previously reported that the special counsel's investigation had widened to include possible financial crimes unrelated to the 2016 presidential election.",
  "\"If you're using Glenn Simpson as a source for nearly anything, I look at it with a very skeptical eye,\" Utah Rep. Chris Stewart said on CNN's \"New Day\" Friday.",
  "\"These issues have nothing to do with the scope of the investigation\" by the House Intelligence Committee, Garten told Reuters in a phone interview.",
  "\"If you start tracking these various projects, you can see a connection, you can see a relationship,\" she said later in the interview.",
  "\"The dossier has proven to be one of the most salacious and unreliable documents that have ever presented before this committee.\"",
  "\"But it's not surprising the minority (Democrats) would focus on this given they've found absolutely no evidence of collusion.\"",
  "\"With the extent to which these were Russian persons, Russian entities, Russian oligarchs, I believe it does,\" Speier said.",
  "\"These accusations are completely reckless and unsubstantiated for a multitude of reasons,\" Garten told the news agency.",
  "But she argued that special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe, is in a position to investigate.",
  "A Republican on the House Intelligence Committee shot down Speier's allegations and concerns about money laundering.",
  "Money laundering is not a focus of the House committee's Russia investigation, according to Speier.",
  "The Trump Organization did not return CNN's request for comment Friday morning on Speier's remarks.",
  "Simpson told lawmakers he thought it was possible there was a \"crime in progress.\"",
  "Speier's accusations echo those of the top Democrat on the committee.",
  "Trump has called the dossier \"fake\" and \"made up.\""
