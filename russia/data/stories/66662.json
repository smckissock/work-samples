  "Noting that some social media users were mobilizing around the hashtag #firecolbert, LifeZette acknowledged, “Despite the outrage, Colbert will likely escape all of this unscathed.” Where LifeZette seemed vaguely disappointed by that, the Daily Caller’s Jim Treacher was dismissive of the whole affair, calling the campaign to get rid of Colbert “pretty dumb” and arguing that objectionable remarks from celebrities like Colbert actually helped get Trump elected by driving undecided voters away from the Democrats.",
  "Breitbart also featured a short post describing quarterback Joe Namath’s assertion that the monologue was “not cool” and that he “didn’t like it at all.”\n\nIndependent Journal Review rounded up a few reactions to Colbert’s jokes, noting, “Some pointed out that similar jokes about former President Barack Obama wouldn't be received as well.” LifeZette took a similar approach in its criticism of the “cock holster” line.",

  "But please use your brain.” Calling Kimmel “hysterical,” she suggested that his family situation had little bearing on national healthcare policy.",
  "“Colbert has ramped up his attacks on the president as his show has seen a steady rise in the ratings since Inauguration Day,” the site wrote.",
  "“My rule of thumb is: Liberals want conservatives to shut up, and conservatives want liberals to keep talking,” Treacher wrote.",
  "Meanwhile, in National Review, Michelle Malkin had some strong words for Kimmel, telling him, “I feel your pain.",
