  "Reuters\n\nChris Wylie, the ex-employee who blew the whistle on the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, said that he did not anticipate the catastrophic effect on Facebook's share price, and is not \"on a crusade\" against the company.",
  "A grassroots backlash has seen \"#deleteFacebook\" trending on social media, while members of the US Senate, UK Parliament, investors, and Facebook's own employees have also made their feelings on the company known.",
  "He addressed the precipitous fall in Facebook's share price after being prompted by Peter Jukes, who was interviewing Wylie in front of an audience at the Frontline Club, a talking shop for journalists.",
  "Wylie continued: \"The frustrating thing for me is this story has really spiralled into Facebook's bizarre reaction to it rather than what the original story was meant to be about.",
  "Wylie responded: \"That was not my intention, and, I'll put it this way: I think that it is Facebook's behaviour that has caused that knock in share price, I don't think it's me.\"",
  "He said that since going public Facebook has \"tried to turn the story against me\" and in the process \"made it a lot worse for themselves.\"",
  "Wylie was discussing the background to the complex story, which broke over the weekend, at a talk in London attended by Business Insider.",
  "Business Insider attempted to speak with Wylie after the talk, but he was ushered away by a group of minders.",
  "Chris Wylie at an event in London on March 20, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal intensified.",
  "\"I think Facebook deserves a certain level of scrutiny, but that wasn't what I set out to do.",
  "Jukes estimated the losses to Facebook's market capitalisation as \"about $50 billion.\"",
  "He is far from the only one to criticise Facebook over its reaction to the scandal.",
  "And that's not necessarily an entirely bad thing.",
  "I'm not on a crusade against Facebook.\"",
  "Further requests were also turned down."
