  "Behnam Dayanim, a partner at international law firm Paul Hastings, told Forbes that in his experience working with U.S. companies on compliance:\n\n“The legal spend has ranged from as low as mid-five figures—$50,000 or $60,000 per project—to high six-figures and there have been projects we've scoped that have been beyond that.”\n\nBesides lawyers, companies are also spending millions on new technology, consultants and, crucially, hiring.",
  "“We can build all the new tech in-house, but we still had to hire an external lawyer to actually help us with consulting on data flows and the points of risk because these are things that, even as a startup, you just can't get wrong.”\n\nWith such huge data risks looming and compliance costs reaching into the millions, many companies are unsurprisingly choosing to opt-out of GDPR entirely.",
  "The social network king—hauled in front of the Senators and members of Congress because of his company’s data failings—even admitted: “it’s certainly worth discussing whether we should have something similar in the U.S.”\n\nMany U.S. lawmakers now see Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as the solution to their Facebook-shaped privacy woes.",
  "Meanwhile, Dayanim says some of Paul Hastings’ U.S. clients only have small European operations and are having “to think very hard about whether they really want to do business with EU data subjects.”\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn a post-Cambridge Analytica world, GDPR’s data protections couldn’t be more timely or relevant.",
  "“But they're spending that money on compliance and not on other initiatives that might generate revenue for their businesses, that's indisputable.”\n\nEY’s Teng says he’s seen is a number of business transformation projects, like the rollout of new HR systems, be placed on hold because of the vast costs of GDPR.",
  "But there’s confusion among businesses around what exactly constitutes ‘consent’ under the new rules and whether consent given in the past is still valid—and their concern is quite valid given the maximum fine for non-compliance with GDPR is 4% of annual turnover or €20 million ($24.6 million).",
  "“Even some FTSE 350 companies that have very established in-house legal teams are having significant costs because they don't have the subject expertise on data privacy, let alone GDPR,” Luther Teng, a senior manager of risk advisory at EY, told Forbes.",
  "For American companies, the combined figure has reached a whopping $7.8 billion , as U.S.-based businesses are having to splash more cash than their British counterparts to avoid the threat of multimillion-dollar fines and penalties from the EU.",
  "Lawyering up\n\nGDPR is a vast piece of legislation which grants people living in Europe new powers over the data being collected about them—like the right to access or delete their own data, and the need for their consent to use it.",
  "British pub giant Wetherspoons recently came to a smart conclusion, rather than checking consent for all the email addresses it’s collected over the years, it took a sledgehammer to the problem and deleted its vast email database.",
  "And there is talk of GDPR experts at law firms around the City of London running competitions among staff to delete as much non-essential data as they can, rather than have to spend the money to ensure records are GDPR compliant.",
  "With 20% of its user base in Europe, Facebook has already warned that compliance will cost it several million dollars after assembling “the largest cross-functional team” in the company’s history to tackle the new rules.",
  "Aakash Ravi, the chief operating officer of Spaceti a Prague-based smart building startup that tracks employee’s movements and helps them find each other, described the legal costs of GDPR on his startup as “onerous”.",
  "Teng says that some of the U.K. companies he’s working with are spending up to 40% of their total GDPR compliance budgets—estimated by the IAPP to be around $2.4 million among FTSE 350 firms—on legal advice alone.",
  "EY’s Teng says he is currently working with a high street gambling company which is looking to delete parts of its database because: “they didn’t realize they had so much personal data that they were collecting”.",
  "Even giants like Facebook have been caught in the lurch by GDPR—highlighted by Zuckerberg’s revealing Senate notes—and are spending millions, scrambling to pull teams together and wrangle their data into shape.",
  "Meanwhile, technology providers like Microsoft are marketing their cloud services as GDPR-compliant, and “big four” consultants like Deloitte and EY are charging big companies to help them get ready for GDPR.",
  "But, as we’ve seen time and time before, the new rules have been left deliberately vague, forcing corporates and startups alike to invest in (expensive) legal experts to interpret what GDPR means for them.",
  "For example, GDPR makes a big deal about obtaining a clear record of explicit ‘consent’ for any personal data to be collected, whether that’s your email address or even just your computer’s IP address.",
  "GDPR forces large companies to hire or appoint a ‘data protection officer’ (DPO), a role that commands a salary between £50,000 ($71,000) and £250,000 ($354,000) depending on the size of the company.",
  "The price of privacy\n\nFortune 500 and FTSE 350 businesses have been forced to spend billions of dollars in a frenzy ahead of the 25 May deadline for the EU’s new data law, Forbes has discovered.",
  "This huge difference in cost compared to their European peers is because many of the requirements of GDPR already exist in EU law and companies have advanced systems in place to deal with them.",
  "Big British firms have now sunk a combined $1.1 billion preparing for GDPR , according to estimates compiled by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and EY.",
  "Others like British pub chain Wetherspoons are taking a sledgehammer to GDPR, dumping huge amounts of data rather than dealing with the costs of following the new regulations.",
  "The crux of GDPR is about putting the power of data back in the hands of consumers, giving us a better understanding of where our data is and what it’s being used for.",
  "Many tech businesses have been built on a free or freemium model—relying on collected data to lure in advertisers—a model which is now being turned upside down.",
  "But there’s a dark side to GDPR, which Zuckerberg’s testimony didn’t touch on—the multi-year, multibillion-dollar, Herculean racket that GDPR has become.",
  "Magic circle law firm Slaughter and May, which counts 20% of the FTSE 100 among its clients, lists GDPR on its website among its top areas of expertise.",
  "Now fears are growing that these huge multibillion-dollar costs are hurting investment and slowing hiring decisions at big businesses around the world.",
  "U.S. lawmakers would do well to consider the vast legal, compliance and the sheer opportunity cost that comes with legislation of this size and scope.",
  "The U.S. angle\n\nWhile European companies are already facing the blistering costs of GDPR, among Fortune 500 firms the costs are soaring even higher.",
  "There are two ways of avoiding GDPR—stop doing business in Europe entirely, or dump the personal data you’re holding—and both are proving popular.",
  "It’s true, as Mark Zuckerberg told lawmakers, “everyone in the world deserves good privacy protections.”\n\nBut such protections don’t come cheap.",
  "Senators last week, Zuckerberg said Facebook would be extending “all the same controls” they are building for GDPR across for his U.S. users.",
  "Sweating in front of U.S. lawmakers last month, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg went to surprising lengths to praise Europe’s new data laws.",
  "All the while, billions are being spent on armies of lawyers and consultants, hundreds of new staff and expensive technology solutions.",
  "But Zuckerberg’s notes revealed many of those GDPR controls are still being built, with just weeks to go before the May deadline.",
  "As the world wakes up to the danger of data, these new rules, first envisioned way back in 2012, are eerily prescient.",
  "It’s a tale of winners and losers in what is being described as a classic business shakedown.",
  "And, as always, it’s the smallest businesses which are likely to be hit hardest.",
  "And in the U.S., legal fees and compliance costs are spiraling even higher.",
  "GDPR is costing the average Fortune 500 company a whopping $16 million.",
  "The top line\n\n“GDPR is causing companies to spend money,” said Dayanim.",
  "The IAPP estimates some 28,000 DPOs will be required across Europe.",
  "And, no surprises, the lawyers are also cashing in.",
  "Bad for business?",
  "Speaking to U.S."
