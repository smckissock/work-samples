  "This raises the question of whether in the future we will have two informational worlds, one a raw toxic cesspool of trolls, hate speech and violence, fed by myriad firehoses of content designed by unblinking algorithms profiling us and trying to turn us into mindless clicking addicts that sell ads and a premium internet above the clouds where we pay digital Sherpas (human or machine) to spend their time wading through the material and finding the material most useful to us.",
  "This has created continual conflict between, on the one hand, a for-profit company attempting to adhere to a complex and fluid web of international laws and customs and enforce a Western, primarily American, perspective on the world, and on the other hand, 2 billion people hailing from across the planet trying to express their own views and perspectives, many of them enjoying for the first time having a voice and ability to communicate their thoughts to the world.",
  "This follows a call from Twitter for academic research proposals to assess and improve the “conversational health” of its platform and Instagram’s call for “cleaning up” the web, while even Apple has begun emphasizing the need to “infuse technology with humanity.” In parallel, the concept of human-curated “safe spaces” is generating interest, in which editors create curated safe environments free of the toxic weight of the rest of the internet.",
  "In particular, once content moderation moves to code maintained by a small number of trusted engineers, rather than instantiated as written guidelines distributed to tens of thousands of contractors that might leak controversial rules, Facebook is much more able to accommodate the demands of repressive regimes that seek to curb lawful and legitimate speech or extend the reach of their own laws to other countries.",
  "On the one hand, having a single set of uniform models would eliminate the immense subjective bias and incomplete decision making that plagues Facebook’s current review process, allowing algorithms to take into account the totality of a given user’s history on the platform, the country they live in, their local culture, the context in which their communication took place, etc.",
  "As Facebook delegates to cold calculating computers decisions about what constitutes “terroristic speech” or a cry for help from a suicidal user, we have no understanding of any kind what those algorithms are looking for or their false positive and false negative rates, while the company declines to provide even the most basic of statistics about their success or failure.",
  "For all the calls by academia for greater research access to Facebook’s data to hold it accountable, it is important to remember that the entire Cambridge Analytica story revolves around a single academic who legally acquired data from the platform for academic research, but then allegedly handed the data off to others without permission.",
  "Private companies in the form of the news media have always been situated between citizens and their government in the US, deciding what the public hears about, but in the social media world there is no longer a choice of different outlets to access different coverage and views – there is only Zuckerberg’s view of the world.",
  "In our modern academia in which university ethics boards, administrations and legal counsels have largely endorsed a world view of academia operating above legal restraints when it comes to data-driven research, any collaboration with academia brings with it extreme risks of leaks and unauthorized data sharing and use.",
  "We are in many ways a global world of unpaid Mechanical Turkers, staring at our phones waiting for the next piece of algorithmically-selected content to arrive for our attention or for notification that some algorithm has decided it is time for us to contribute some new piece of material to the global content factory.",
  "In short, our acceptance of having our data mined from Facebook, having our most intimate conversations and interactions commercialized mirrors our acceptance of having algorithms decide what we see online and means there will likely be little outcry when the algorithms start deciding what we can talk about as well.",
  "As social platforms increasingly become the intermediaries through which we communicate with and consume the world around us, the myriad invisible decisions they make each day about what we see and what we can talk about act as an invisible hand guiding us towards their idealized vision of utopia.",
  "In fact, with the centralization of content moderation in the hands of engineers (largely Western and based in the US) versus its current distributed multilingual and multicultural moderation workforce, there is much reason to be concerned that biases will get far worse, rather than better.",
  "With its current human based review process, the company has repeatedly declined to make its review materials or even basic demographic information about its reviewers available, such as what percent of them are female, what languages they speak and what parts of the world they hail from.",
  "The company’s playbook this past week was the tried and true one for a company that knows the wave will pass and sure enough, the discussion is already rapidly fading away with few to none ramifications to the company other than a few sleepless nights for its communications staff.",
  "The last remaining freedom we have is our choice of what to say, but sometime very soon that too will disappear as AI algorithms complete their final takeover of humanity and all that will be left is the thunderous applause of the miracles of Silicon Valley's social media masters.",
  "In his Q&A with Wired earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg once again raised the question of whether AI tools should be used to proactively govern online platforms, automatically deleting anything that “might be offensive content or violate some rules” before it is ever seen.",
  "The kind of Facebook analysis Cambridge Analytica stands accused of (which it strenuously denies) pales in comparison to what academic researchers do every day with data harvested from Facebook and none of Zuckerberg’s proposed remedies will do anything to curtail them.",
  "It means that we’ve accepted Zuckerberg’s way once again instead of having a public reckoning about the very issues at the heart of ideas like having AI systems extend their reach and not only wield absolute power over what we see, but over what we do and say as well.",
  "However, even with perfect models and perfect data, the rulesets encoded in these models as set forth by Facebook may bear little resemblance to what its 2 billion users want or need – they reflect what Zuckerberg wants for the world, without any input from its users.",
  "Putting this all together, algorithms already control what we see and engage with online, putting the information it believes we should have in front of us and making it nearly impossible to locate and engage with material it doesn’t want to promote.",
  "Indeed, Zuckerberg notes that Facebook’s 2 billion users might not want others, including academics, snooping through their data and that privacy is increasingly mattering more to its userbase than new experiences and ways of sharing their data.",
  "For the simple fact that once again we’ve accepted Facebook’s world view on our digital rights, our ownership of our digital selves and the right of companies to use our private information to manipulate us and control what we see and do.",
  "Instead of the beginning of the end of the status quo for social media or some kind of revolution restoring our ownership of our digital selves, this story was always destined to be a brief blip on the radar with little lasting change.",
  "Do we want algorithms that force us to behave like reasonable adults, offering informed and well-evidenced and researched opinions devoid of emotion or profanity, reverting the web back to its roots and making us more like machines?",
  "If Twitter adopts a similar approach as an outcome of its \"conversational health\" initiative, there may no longer be a place for the free exchange of ideas, especially as companies begin to work together to adopt similar standards.",
  "Not at all – Zuckerberg would wait until the fever was breaking, give his usual mea culpa, the press and public would accept it with a few grumbles and congratulations and Facebook would go back to doing what it always does.",
  "Facebook could easily deploy this very afternoon AI tools that could block common profanity and many kinds of verbal attacks and filter the imagery we post to eliminate a large fraction of violent and pornographic material.",
  "Indeed, earlier this week amongst all the breathless headlines, analyst notes and watercooler and Slack chatter about the end of Facebook, I was bombarded with queries about whether I thought this would bring about change.",
  "Far from an isolated story of a single researcher gone rogue, the alleged Cambridge Analytica story that has emerged mirrors that of the broader academic world that happens every day and which I have detailed extensively.",
  "According to my GDELT Project, roughly 74% of worldwide media coverage it monitored of the story across all countries and 65 languages emphasized the claim that the data was used to directly influence the 2016 election.",
  "Social media companies have trained us to pour our thoughts out to the world, to throw inhibition to the wind and just stream of consciousness every little thought that pops into our minds into the digital ether.",
  "Publicly traded companies don’t get to say “trust us” with their financials – they are required to subject themselves to external audits from third party accredited firms to verify that everything is in order.",
  "Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required to subject their algorithms to external verification and auditing to ensure they are not disproportionately biased against certain demographics or views?",
  "Given the company’s steadfast refusal to offer even the most rudimentary transparency into its current operations, there is little hope it will do so in any meaningful way when it comes to its AI algorithms.",
  "Indeed, I was right, as the story has rapidly faded from the press in the 48 hours since his speech and even its stock fall mirrors the short drop it made right after the 2016 election before recovering.",
  "According to Zuckerberg, the “#deletefacebook” movement has fizzled out with little change, much like every previous outcry about Facebook’s approach to privacy, data ownership or content moderation.",
  "In short, the story of how 50 million Facebook profiles came to be downloaded from Facebook was never about data privacy or digital rights, it was merely one more reckoning about the 2016 election.",
  "The “Ice Bucket Challenge versus Ferguson” divide has only grown in the four years since, as more and more platforms move to algorithmic curation (though Instagram has recently taken a step back).",
  "Imagine such movements trying to have their voice heard in a world in which AI algorithms decide what is permissible speech and ban that which is \"offensive\" or uncomfortable to the powerful.",
  "After all, the task before it is equivalent to establishing a single set of laws and rules that apply equally to the entire planet, wiping away the differences that make us who we are.",
  "Today that government is run as an absolute dictatorship with zero input from its citizens and little recourse when they are wronged – scream too loudly and you might even be banished.",
  "However, even if Facebook wanted to make itself more democratic (and that’s a big if), it is not readily apparent how it might do so, given just how different its 2 billion users are.",
  "The notion of using AI tools to proactively remove content deemed “offensive” is an especially frightening one in a world in which Facebook is increasingly our interface to the world.",
  "The early Internet respected these boundaries, establishing a decentralized network of machines that at once bridged the geographic divide and understood its geopolitical boundaries.",
  "In short, it is what brings out the worst in us, reverting us from logical reasonable conscientious adults to schoolyard bullies and prima donnas in search of our 15 minutes of fame.",
  "In that light we can see that the outcome of this story could never be a newfound focus on our digital rights or a broader look at how social media controls our informational lives.",
  "With all of their flaws and biases, Facebook’s army of human content moderators are still at the end of the day human and bring with them that humanity to the decisions they make.",
  "Facebook has upended this understanding, creating a single digital dictatorship which wields absolute power over what its 2 billion citizens are permitted to do on its grounds.",
  "Most importantly, it raises the question of whether this is the future we want and just how much control we will have over those guides that control what we say and do online.",
  "Over its 15 years, Facebook in particular has been instrumental in profoundly changing global expectations and standards of privacy and ownership of our selves and destinies.",
  "Once a small number of engineers working directly for management are responsible for all moderation on the platform, the final bit of humanity in the process will disappear.",
  "Even when it works perfectly, biases in its training data will manifest in its final decisions, which its Western programmers may never know to look for or even care about.",
  "There’s a reason we talk about Facebook instead of LinkedIn – it is where we go to be our emotional uninhibited selves where opinions reign supreme and facts are optional.",
  "On the other hand, even the best AI today is far from infallible and can be confounded by the slightest deviations and even hallucinate things that aren’t there.",
  "Before the past week’s media obsession with who owns our data, much of the conversation around Facebook of late has focused on this singularly critical question.",
  "Yet, in doing so it would fundamentally change what the platform is, altering it from an entertainment platform into an informational platform like LinkedIn.",
  "The problem with this is that democracy is premised on transparency – that in democratic societies we have an understanding of what our government is doing.",
  "Governmental bodies rarely have the technical expertise to understand the complex and constantly evolving technologies behind state-of-the-art AI systems.",
  "For every science fiction plot of humans gradually ceding ever-greater control to machines that make decisions for them, we have arrived at that future.",
  "Indeed, it was only because of the variety of the American news ecosystem that the \"#metoo\" movement was able to burst into the public consciousness.",
  "Much as our interest in “fake news” and “filter bubbles” came about because of the election, so too does this story have its roots in the election.",
  "In some parts of the developing world, Facebook is effectively the entire internet, meaning it has absolute control over people’s digital lives.",
  "We speak different languages, come from different backgrounds and have very different beliefs and cultures that cannot always be easily unified.",
  "The Chinese could ban discussion of Tiananmen Square within their own borders, but that blockade would have no impact in the rest of the world.",
  "There could never be a conversation about whether we should have AI control what we say and do online – the story was never about any of that.",
  "Social platforms already quietly curate our world through myriad opaque algorithms that we have no legal right to inspect or even challenge.",
  "Platforms design tailor-made interfaces to relentlessly focus us on the benefits (possible fame), without ever considering the consequences.",
  "Building community by its very nature implies that we are all different and those differences should be embraced and respected.",
  "After all, Facebook’s Trending Topics module was starkly biased against Africa and no-one at Facebook either noticed or cared.",
  "However, this simplistic ideal avoids the simple fact that the 7 billion people that inhabit planet earth are not all alike.",
  "In short, each country could choose its own destiny, but could not enforce its will over the rest of the digital world.",
  "What does it mean for a platform like Facebook to have total control over what we say and do in its walled garden?",
  "In short, Facebook’s approach to any questions about its operations has been to simply “trust us” and that’s it.",
  "Imagine if Facebook deployed a set of master AI models that governed the world of Facebook with absolute power.",
  "It’s the place that transforms the most humble and shy individuals into their outgoing narcissist alter egos.",
  "Or is the toxic troll-laden free-for-all that is our modern social web the world we subconsciously crave?",
  "Could AI moderation algorithms in the end help clean up social media from the toxic cesspool it is today?",
  "So too will the inevitable takeover of the machines come with a brief outcry and eventual acceptance.",
  "Throughout human history we have grouped together into civilizations that share basic commonalities.",
  "Updates would instantly be rolled out to the entire world and applied uniformly without favoritism.",
  "It's where we’ve been taught to pour forth our most intimate selves in search of fame and fortune.",
  "Facebook says its focus is on nurturing “community” and bringing us together as a society.",
  "Why does it matter how swiftly the Cambridge Analytica story has faded from view?",
  "Academia would seem to be a better fit, but could academia actually be trusted?",
  "This raises the critical question of who will audit all of these new models?",
  "Do we even care if the algorithms finish their takeover of our lives?",
  "Was this story ever about privacy or our digital rights?",
  "That is the million-dollar question in all of this.",
  "In the end, does any of this really matter?",
  "My answer?",
  "Perhaps."
