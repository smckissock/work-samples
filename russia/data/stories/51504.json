  "The nature of this vile regime, that lies, cheats and steals whatever it wants to survive, along with a human rights rap sheet filled with millions of innocent dead men, women and children serves as the ultimate warning to trust nothing that comes out of Kim's mouth.",
  "What one defector told me in 2014 seems even more relevant now than ever: \"The Kim family not only killed my entire family but they broke my soul into pieces that I will never be able to put back together.",
  "Several examples only go to show the lengths North Korea will go to when it wants to silence internal dissent or hush up anyone internally who cries out for anything resembling freedom.",
  "His demands for giving up those nuclear weapons could be a price we could never meet—like hundreds of billions of dollars and the complete removal of U.S. military forces.",
  "History cries out for us to be skeptical, to listen to Kim's own people, who were promised a communist paradise, but who were treated worse than slaves.",
  "In interviewing several North Korean defectors while researching a book project, I saw the mental and physical scars they will never heal from.",
  "I also know the chances of Kim giving up his nuclear weapons are still slim to none.",
  "You don't talk to monsters like that—you fear them.",
  "And you never trust them.",
  "You run from them.",
  "Ever.\""
