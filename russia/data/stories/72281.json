  "Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has strongly condemned the new authorities, saying Monday they came to power as a result of an \"armed mutiny\" and their legitimacy is causing \"big doubts.\"",
  "\"If you consider Kalashnikov-toting people in black masks who are roaming Kiev to be the government, then it will be hard for us to work with that government,\" Medvedev said."
