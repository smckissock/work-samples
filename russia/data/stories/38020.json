  "Topping the 2017 Best Midsize Employers List this year is Lush, a retail cosmetics and personal care products company that operates 200 locations in the United States but is headquartered in Poole, U.K. By the numbers, Lush, which placed 13th last year, received a score of 9.34 points out of a possible 10, showing that U.S. employees at the firm gave their employer high marks.",
  "We round up the top 800 in a ranking we call our “Best Employers.”\n\nWith the help of our research partner, Statista – a massive statistics database and consumer research firm based in Hamburg, Germany – we formed and divided our roster of best employers into two categories: large ones with more than 5,000 employees, and midsize with between 1,000 and 5,000 workers.",
  "“Quite simply, we believe in doing good by the people, the animals and the planet.”\n\nThose values come through in the company’s decision to use minimal packaging for its wares, its refusal to test products on animals and the ethical sourcing of product ingredients, Halls explained.",
  "Employees were also asked to rate their employers on various work factors, like pay, diversity or avenues to advancement—though these results did not affect the overall score, they were a way of gauging what a given company was doing right or wrong in gaining employee approval.",
  "Employees also might be heartened, she added, to Lush’s employee volunteering program or its forays into politcal campaigns in favor of such causes as equal marriage rights, the fight against the use of fur in fashion apparel and the support of fair trade policies.",
  "Leaping from a 42nd place showing in 2016 to third place in the latest results we find New Seasons Market, a privately owned Portland-based chain of grocery stores with locations in the northwest and California which employs more than 3,200 people.",
  "Respondents were also asked to divulge which other companies they either would or would not recommend, but that data did not hold as much weight, explained Klaas Seestädt, a Statista analyst who oversaw the project.",
  "“When I hear that our staff is really engaged by the brand image, that really speaks to the fact that our actions align with our beliefs as an organization,” says Brandi Halls, Brand Director at Lush.",
  "On the other side of the spectrum, workers in the Restaurant space, Business Servies and Supplies, and Retail & Wholesale sectors were less likely to recommend the firm that employed them.",
  "Another performer on this year’s midsize roster was Rackspace, a cloud computing company based in Windcrest, Texas, which placed second close behind Lush with 9.33 points.",
  "That assured that they could divulge their opinions free of company influence and without fear that their responses would become known to their employers or colleagues.",
  "In terms of the factors that drove employer recommendations, the most profound were atmosphere at work (25%) and pride in service or products the company provides.",
  "Each year, Forbes seeks to discover which companies operating in the U.S. today are best at making their employees feel happy, inspired, and well-compensated.",
  "According to respondents, Lush employees were most taken with the company’s image, its diversity, and to a lesser extent its working conditions.",
  "The most weighted question asked of survey respondents was whether they would recommend their own company to others, on a scale of zero to 10.",
  "Results vary by industry as well, says Seestädt, as some are more likely to see employees recomend their employers—and some are not.",
  "In the Construction, Oil & Gas Operations, Mining and Chemicals industry, workers were more likely to give a positive review.",
  "In compiling the data for both the large and midsize companies lists, Statista surveyed 30,000 employees in total.",
  "In the past year the firm was successfully acquired by Apollo Global Management for a reported $4.3 billion.",
  "Respondents were not consulted via their employers but anonymously through several online panels.",
  "For a look at the list of larger companies, read our report on America’s Best Employers.",
  "This year its workers’ testimony earned the company a score of 9.16 in our rankings.",
  "The same went for IT, Internet, Software & Services; as well as Travel and Leisure.",
  "For a quick look at the top 20 midsize companies, check out our slideshow above.",
  "That was followed by salary, which was a 16% driver of company recommendation."
