  "As Poppe put it: “Valeant and the chief executive [Michael Pearson] had a good insight, which is that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry was spending a lot of money on [research and development] and not getting a great return on original research and development ideas.”\n\n“What if you could build a pharmaceutical company using low interest rates and cheap cost of capital to acquire products in some area where the doctors .",
  "Ruane and Buffett’s lifelong friendship began at an investment seminar led by longtime Buffett mentor Benjamin Graham, a professor at Columbia University who was called “the father of value investing.”\n\nBuffett, Ruane, Cunniff and a cadre of other Graham disciples ran with the value investing ethos, building names and fortunes for themselves.",
  "But the 47-year-old mutual fund known as much for its ties to billionaire Warren Buffett as for its uncanny stock picks that created massive wealth for clients — retirement funds, pension funds, university endowments and regular-Joe investors — has had to descend from its lofty perch in the past two years and rescue its good name.",

  "It stuck with the shares even as Valeant was battered by Wall Street and by relentless media coverage of its strategy of using debt to buy drug companies, then laying off employees, doing away with research and jacking up prices — which resulted in embarrassing congressional hearings and federal investigations.",
  "Why did they buy a company that wasn’t doing anything but [acquisitions]?”\n\nValeant’s denouement included a tense Senate hearing; the departure of Pearson, once the highest-paid chief executive in Canada, at $182.9 million; criminal charges involving fraud; and kickbacks involving the mail-order pharmacy.",
  "If you can contribute one really great idea, a big idea every five years that we can scale up and that really works, you are doing a heck of a job.”\n\nThe company tries to discourage pride of ownership so an analyst doesn’t become hellbent on getting an idea through the five-person investment committee.",
  "As recently as 2016, Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting that he considered himself the Sequoia Fund’s “father.”\n\n“I’m the father of Sequoia Fund in that when I was closing up my [Buffett] partnership at the end of 1969, I was giving back a lot of money to partners,” Buffett said.",
  "“When, through appreciation, it grew and became a much bigger part of the portfolio, each of the outside directors expressed concerns.”\n\nAt the end of the day, in the world of investing where stock-pickers are judged by knowing when to take some chips off the table, Sequoia had waited too long.",
  "And sometimes very wrong.”\n\n“If you do very diligent research and make analyzing businesses your life’s work rather than just a hobby,” he said, “every so often, you will be able to come to a pretty firm conviction about what the future holds for an individual business.",
  "“That ethos has been consistent for the whole 47 years of the firm.”\n\nHarris said that “a typical analyst can do six to eight really good projects a year at the most.” Sequoia’s 20 analysts therefore yield about 120 or so proposals a year for consideration.",
  "And it worked for a pretty good period of time.”\n\nBut what Sequoia married itself to was an offshore drug company that borrowed heavily to buy other drug companies, cut costs and research, then raised prices on many older drugs to astronomical heights.",
  "The first years were difficult, but by the mid-1970s, Ruane, Cunniff found its footing by discovering unnoticed public companies, including The Washington Post Co. (which had then recently gone public), Interpublic Group and Ogilvy & Mather.",

  "Looking up from the wreckage, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger called Valeant “a sewer” and its business practices “deeply immoral.” Buffett called it a “Wall Street scheme” with an “enormously flawed” business model.",
  "“I worry about everything,” he said, “but I didn’t actually worry that the firm was not going to make it.”\n\nHarris added, “Not for a second.”\n\nSeveral members of the senior team have doubled down on Sequoia by purchasing its shares.",
  "And that is what happened.”\n\n\n\nRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, with offices in the famed Solow Building, pulls in more than $100 million a year in revenue from its 1 percent annual fee on the combined $11 billion that the firm manages.",
  "“It was quite painful, but most clients made money on Valeant,” said chief executive David Poppe, sitting in a conference room overlooking the regal Plaza Hotel, with leafy Central Park and the Bronx in the distance.",
  "(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nThe financial whizzes cocooned in the serene offices of the Sequoia Fund atop one of New York’s iconic office buildings seem far removed from the noise of the city far below.",
  "Sequoia grew to maturity under the glow of Buffett, the folk-hero money mind whose stewardship of Berkshire Hathaway prompted a national following based on the virtues of common-sense investing and avoiding mistakes.",
  "Sequoia director John B. Harris put it this way: “The crux of value investing is this notion that the vast majority of people, the investing public at large, tends to get things mostly right but not always right.",
  "(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nHigh expectations\n\nIt is free-lunch Friday at Sequoia, and this reporter is stunned at the view as I enter the 50th-floor offices where the Sequoia Fund is headquartered.",
  "A big miscalculation on one stock, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, has cost the Sequoia Fund billions of dollars and compromised its reputation for market-beating performance earned over decades.",
  "“This is a time where from an optics standpoint,” he said, “they want to be performing really well.”\n\nPoppe and his senior team said performance will go a long way to washing away the Valeant stain.",
  "“He did a fantastic job, and even now, if you take the record from the inception to now with the troubles they’ve had recently, I don’t know a mutual fund in the United States with a better record.",
  "I once asked a prominent real estate mogul in New York, “What is the most prestigious and valuable piece of New York commercial real estate?”\n\nNine West 57th, he said without a moment’s pause.",
  "They tied themselves to one stock and made it their centerpiece.”\n\nAround 2010, Ruane, Cunniff began buying 34 million shares at around $19, which came to about a $650 million investment.",
  "You won’t find many records that go for 30 or 40 years that are better than the S&P.”\n\nPart of the key at Ruane, Cunniff was to concentrate on a few stocks, at first maybe eight or 10.",
  "“Something has got to be really good, and there’s got to be great conviction before we want to make that investment.”\n\nWere they ever worried the firm was not going to survive Valeant?",
  "If there are profits after expenses, they are paid in distributions to the Ruane, Cunniff private owners, comprising employees and outside shareholders, including the Cunniff family.",
  "“These people trusted me, and they wanted to know what they should do with their money.”\n\n“Bill, who would not otherwise have done so, said, ‘I’ll set up a fund,’ ” Buffett recalled.",
  "That’s the year William J. Ruane and Rick Cunniff, friends and graduates of the Harvard Business School, founded a stock-picking firm that became known as Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.",
  "The drop came as Valeant cut its ties with a controversial mail-order pharmacy called Philidor after it was accused of being a “phantom pharmacy” used to artificially boost sales.",
  "“Bill and Rick had a strong conviction that they wanted to die having beaten the S&P 500 more than they wanted to die having maximized our assets under management,” Poppe said.",
  "It’s not unheard of for a Sequoia analyst to spend a decade investigating a company, going to annual meetings, talking to dozens of employees, managers, customers, suppliers.",
  "It stopped taking on new clients for many years so its assets did not become unwieldy, which would make it difficult to find companies that could positively affect results.",
  "Most of them have virtually their entire net worth tied up in the firm, through direct ownership of shares in Ruane, Cunniff or through ownership of Sequoia Fund shares.",
  "“It was during a board phone call when we were discussing this, and somebody, it might have been me, said, ‘You are not buying more Valeant, are you?’ ” Osberg recalled.",
  "“Suddenly we look like a losing team.”\n\n\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Ruane, Cunniff found its footing by discovering unnoticed public companies, including The Washington Post Co.",
  "Here, Katharine Graham, the Post Co. board chair, is joined by Thornton F. Bradshaw, left, former chair of RCA, and Warren Buffett, chair of Berkshire Hathaway, in 1987.",
  "The rebuilding process comes at a time when investors are leaving stock-picking funds such as Sequoia for index-based mutual funds, which track a fixed basket of stocks.",
  "Ruane, Cunniff has always had two parts: the Sequoia Fund and, separately, individual clients that include families, individuals, pensions, foundations and endowments.",

  "[The story behind Atlantic owner David Bradley’s ‘biggest business failure’]\n\nOver the years, the firm developed an almost cultlike, word-of-mouth following.",
  "Its assets under management have been halved from $8 billion pre-scandal to $4.2 billion, with a big chunk attributable to a nose-dive in Valeant stock.",
  "The 1990s produced stakes in Fifth Third Bank, Progressive Insurance, Harley-Davidson and Johnson & Johnson, all of which were sold at healthy profits.",
  "Value stocks such as the ones Sequoia seeks out are finding themselves less loved by a bull market that is on the hunt for the next Apple or Facebook.",
  "“They just think about what business they want to be part owners of going into the future.”\n\nAt first, Valeant appeared to be another success story.",
  "Now, after the loss of some major investors because of Valeant, Sequoia has installed a more rigorous approach to picking stocks and selling them.",
  "The $100 million covers salaries for its 60 employees, including Wall Street salaries for its 20 analysts who travel widely researching companies.",
  "One keeper of the flame is Jonathan Brandt, the resident Berkshire Hathaway analyst and 25-year employee whose father worked at Ruane, Cunniff.",
  "It enjoyed a reputation for sobriety, transparency and a resistance to volatility, which drew blue-chip clients such as The Washington Post.",
  "“Sequoia continued to buy when I felt it was an extremely risky investment and way too large a percentage of our portfolio,” Osberg said.",
  "(Mario Cabrera/AP)\n\nValue investing\n\nTo understand how and why Sequoia bet the farm on Valeant, you need to understand value investing.",
  "The firm nurtures a filial atmosphere with an almost solemn devotion to the legacy of the founders and their value-based belief system.",
  "“If your happiness is defined by ‘How many ideas do I get into the fund every year?’ then you’re going to be frustrated,” Harris said.",
  "“We have had various positions in the high single and even in the low double digits” as a share of the portfolio, Lowenstein said.",
  "Value investors such as Sequoia generally seek ignored, under-the-radar companies that have been misjudged and have room to grow.",
  "“They made a huge mistake,” said Steve Goldberg, who runs Tweddell Goldberg, an investment management firm in Silver Spring, Md.",
  "Under the old system, Goldfarb, Poppe and one other rotating analyst decided when to make an investment and whether to end one.",
  "Activist investor Bill Ackman, long a defender of the company, eventually surrendered his Valeant shares at a $4 billion loss.",
  "If you invested $10,000 in the Sequoia Fund in July 1970 and never touched it, you would have had $3,961,656 on June 30, 2017.",
  "Its 1 percent annual fee on the combined $11 billion that the firm manages creates more than $100 million a year in revenue.",
  "Owner Sheldon Solow, a college dropout and son of a bricklayer, rode this marble-and-glass landmark to a $4 billion fortune.",
  "And fewer assets meant the 1 percent fee was collecting from a smaller pot, which in turn meant less income for the owners.",
  "I resigned the next day.”\n\nIn 2016, Sequoia finally sold its shares in Valeant in the high $20s, or for about $1 billion.",
  "Its architect was one of the most prominent of the mid-20th century, Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.",

  "Harris visited 100 stores before the company made a bet on O’Reilly Auto Parts, which has been a huge home run.",
  "“They generally don’t leave.”\n\nPoppe, a former journalist with the Miami Herald, has been at the firm 18 years.",
  "By 2015, that stake had risen above $8.5 billion, riding the arc of Valeant’s stock price to $260 per share.",
  "“Goldfarb became very enthralled with the Valeant chief executive,” Morningstar analyst Kevin McDevitt said.",
  "“Bill had a saying, ‘Your six best ideas in life will do better than all your other ones,’ ” Poppe said.",
  "Its performance took big hits for three years in a row — in 2016 by a whopping 18.86 percentage points.",
