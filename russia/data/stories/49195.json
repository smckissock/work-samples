  "Among the conclusions more likely to be disputed by Democrats - in part because they featured in the contentious \"Nunes memo\" documenting alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI and DOJ that was released last month - are, \"the dossier compiled by Christopher Steele formed an essential part of an application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain electronic surveillance on Carter Page.\"",

  "\"When the majority made it clear they were going to take issue even with those fundamental conclusions at least as it pertained to Donald Trump, it was clear that their report was going to be completely political from beginning to end,\" Schiff said, \"and there wasn't really much to work on in a joint fashion.\"",
