  "Hannity on Mueller Probe: Rod Rosenstein 'Aiding and Abetting' the 'Threat to Rule of Law'\n\nWATCH: Tucker Battles Dem on Legitimacy of Trump-Russia Dossier in Mueller Probe\n\nMike Huckabee sounded off Thursday morning on the hundreds of anti-Trump text messages exchanged between two FBI agents in 2016.",
  "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- who appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller -- was pressed by GOP lawmakers on the messages between Peter Strzok and another FBI official with whom he was having an affair.",
  "Huckabee emphasized an Aug. 2016 message in which Strzok wrote to Lisa Page: \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there's no way he gets elected â€” but I'm afraid we can't take that risk.",
  "It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40...\"\n\nHe said that message -- which appears to reference top FBI deputy Andrew McCabe -- seemingly goes beyond a simple political opinion from Strzok.",
  "Strzok, who was demoted and removed from Mueller's team over the summer, expressed his support for Hillary Clinton, calling Trump a \"f---ing idiot\" and a \"d--che\" and writing \"F TRUMP.\"",

  "He said he has full confidence in the rank-and-file within the FBI and Justice Department, but \"there's something rotten at the head of this fish.\"",
  "\"This is an intent to stage what essentially amounts to a coup d'etat of the highest elected office in the United States of America,\" he said.",
  "Rosenstein said the Justice Department inspector general is conducting a full review of the messages.",
  "\"This stuff smells worse than a feed lot at a hog farm,\" former Arkansas Gov.",
