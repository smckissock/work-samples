  "In Brian Stelter’s media newsletter “Reliable Sources” on Tuesday,” CNN reporter Donie O’Sullivan explained that CNN presented its findings about the fake “Black Lives Matter” page to Facebook last week, but the company initially dismissed concerns by saying the page did not violate its “community standards.” Facebook also did not divulge whether more traffic had been driven to the bogus page through Facebook ads.",
  "I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”\n\n[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill: ‘It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.’]\n\nZuckerberg’s apologetic tone and vow to change, however, were not reflected in Facebook’s response to the fake “Black Lives Matter” page, according to CNN and others who had tried to warn the social media platform earlier about the possible scam.",

  "“The discovery raises a lot of Q’s about how Facebook polices its platform — if it can’t figure out there is something up with the biggest ‘BLM’ account, with almost 700,000 followers, why should we trust it to find other fakes?”\n\nBlack Lives Matter did not immediately respond to questions sent by email Tuesday morning.",

  "He also brushed off questions about several other websites — with names such as blackpowerfist.com and blacklivesmatter.media — that were registered to him, and which the “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page had occasionally promoted.",
  "Online fundraisers previously associated with the page have also been disabled, and third-party payment companies such as Classy, Donorbox, PayPal and Patreon all told CNN they had cut ties with the page.",
  "As it turns out, the page was apparently a fraud, tied to an Australian man who had also registered dozens of other domain names related to black civil rights causes, according to a CNN investigation.",
  "The alleged “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page also brought in at least $100,000 in donations through third-party online fundraisers such as PayPal and Patreon, CNN reported.",

  "“Not for the first time, Facebook took action against a major bad actor on its site not on its own but because journalists made inquiries,” O’Sullivan told Stelter.",

  "The trade union said in a statement that it was investigating Mackay’s alleged association with the fraudulent Facebook page.",
