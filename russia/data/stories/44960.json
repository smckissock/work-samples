  "Under the proposal, large companies, such as those with data on more than 50,000 people, would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data and opt out of having the data sold to third parties.",
  "The Internet Association, which also represents Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc has also opposed the bill, as have the California Chamber of Commerce and the Association of National Advertisers.",
  "Google executives have warned that the measure could have unintended consequences but have not said what those might be.",
  "Governor Jerry Brown signed the measure into law after it was passed by the state legislature.",
  "\"State-specific laws will stifle American innovation and confuse consumers,\" CTIA said.",
  "CTIA, a wireless industry trade group, called on Congress to pass legislation instead.",
  "Ali Bay, the governor's deputy press secretary, declined to comment.",
  "Each violation would carry a $7,500 fine.",
  "The law would apply only in California."
