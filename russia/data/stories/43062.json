  "Damian Collins, the Conservative politician overseeing a select committee enquiry into fake news, wrote to Nix: \"[There] are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us of 27 February, notably your denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company.",
  "We urge you to come forward and explain your comments...\"\n\nNix last appeared at the fake news select committee enquiry in February, mostly to explain — or not explain — how Cambridge Analytica was involved in 2016's Leave.EU campaign.",
  "But his evidence is now contradicted by reports last week that Cambridge Analytica did access 50 million profiles without consent, by buying the data from an academic researcher which gathered the information through a Facebook app.",
  "But he also denied earlier media reports that the firm had used Facebook data to show voters highly targeted political advertising, both for the US presidential election in 2016 and during the Brexit vote.",
  "The revelations caused an uproar: Facebook has banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform while it investigates, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised publicly, and Nix was suspended from his role.",
  "Parliament TV\n\nBritish politicians have summoned the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to explain why he keeps contradicting himself about the way his firm used Facebook data.",
  "He later added: \"People are not giving us consent and Facebook does not have a mechanism that allows third parties such as us to access its data on its customers.\"",
  "We are also interested in asking you again about your claim that you \"do not work with Facebook data, and [...] do not have Facebook data.\"",
  "You can read all the other times Cambridge Analytica has contradicted itself here, and an explanation of what the firm does here.",
  "It's certain that Nix will be asked to explain the inconsistencies in his evidence if he agrees to appear before the committee.",
  "In other words, Nix explicitly denied that Cambridge Analytica took data belonging to Facebook users without their consent.",
  "We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and most agencies, or all agencies, I should say.",
  "Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix gives evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee.",
  "At the time, he said: \"We do not work with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data.",
  "He added: \"Giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter.",
  "We roll out surveys on Facebook that the public can engage with if they elect to.\"",
  "We use Facebook as a means to gather [opinion] data."
