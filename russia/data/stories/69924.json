  "At Money2020 this year a venture capital panel predicted that venture capital deployment in FinTech will top $20Bn in 2015, whereas Accenture recently predicted FinTech investments would reach at least $8Bn by 2018 in New York alone.",
  "These metrics also don’t include the IPO of LendingClub, which raised over $800m alone, or the plethora of $100m+ investments that banks like HSBC, Sberbank, BBVA, Santander and others have committed to FinTech.",
  "However, this doesn’t gel with the fact that Crunchbase and MarketsMedia calculated that in the first quarter of 2014 alone $1.7Bn was invested in 167 deals.",
  "1 / 11 Fintech is HOT right now\n\n2014 was the biggest year in FinTech by far, but how much was invested globally in FinTech this year?",
  "StrategyEye estimated that there was $2.8Bn raised in 2014 via venture capital investments in FinTech.",
  "Just in Bitcoin related startups alone, more than $400m was invested in 2014."
