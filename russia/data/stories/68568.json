  "REUTERS/Alexsey Druginyn/RIA Novosti/Pool\n\n\"Against this background, Russia's recent military spending binge is all the more notable for it suggests that the government, desperate to retain popular support amid declining economic performance, is less interested in investing in the most modern equipment than in showing its support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine, even at the price of further economic hardship,\" writes Guriev.",
  "Even with the Kremlin's revised budget plan in April (which assumes an average exchange rate of 61.5 rubles to the dollar), Russia is spending more on its military than it can afford to, according to Russian economist and former rector of the New Economic School in Moscow Sergei Guriev.",
  "In the best case scenario, according to Guriev, \"Russia can maintain a 3.7% deficit for less than two years before it either has to withdraw from Ukraine to gain relief from Western sanctions, or undertake a major — and for Putin, politically dangerous — fiscal adjustment.\"",
  "The ongoing Western sanctions prevent Russia from borrowing on the global markets, so Moscow has had to tap into this fund to finance its deficit, which has increased to 3.7% from 0.5% of GDP following lower oil prices and the economic contraction, according to Guriev.",
  "Guriev points out that recently published budget data for the first three months of 2015 shows that although nondefense spending was at 16.5% of the quarterly GDP as planned, military expenditure was more than double the budgeted amount at over 9% of the quarterly GDP.",
  "\"If Russia could not afford a 4%-of-GDP defense budget in good times, it cannot possibly manage such a high rate of military spending now, when it confronts rock-bottom oil prices, Western sanctions, and economic recession.\"",
  "REUTERS/Mikhail Klimentyev/RIA Novosti/Kremlin\n\nHowever, \"even this scenario may be too optimistic\" given that Russia spent more than twice the budgeted amount on military in the first quarter, according to Guriev.",
  "Since 2011, there's been debate in the Kremlin about whether Russia should increase military spending, which ended with then finance minister Alexei Kudrin (who was against increased spending) getting sacked.",
