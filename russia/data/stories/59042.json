  "The group is also interested in reported texts between Strzok and Page that appear to show the FBI eliminated evidence that Clinton compromised “high-level communications.” Furthermore, the group is concerned with texts that show Strzok texted Page to tell her that senior FBI officials “water(ed) down the reference to President Obama,” using “senior government official” instead.",
