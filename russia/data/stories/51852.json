  "Stealing personal data on Americans is typically the trade of Russian, eastern European and criminal western hacking groups that specialized on selling private data on the black market for profit.",
  "Chinese health care is undergoing its own crisis in recent years and the hackers were looking for the data to learn how a large American health care company manages its health delivery systems.",
  "It's a common tactic of hackers to steal the computer credentials of computer systems employees who have free rein of the databases they're trying to break into.",
  "To find citizens willing to spy for the Chinese and identify potential U.S. spies operating in China, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike's cofounder.",
  "Cybersecurity firms that aren't working on this case caution that it's far too early to definitely say the Chinese government is behind this attack.",
  "The hack was uncovered when a computer systems employee stumbled on the hack in progress, according to a U.S. official briefed on the investigation.",
  "However, it's common for hackers to route attacks through multiple countries and mask IP addresses in these attacks as a way to hide their trail.",
  "Anthem's investigators believe they have an explanation for the unusual Chinese hack, according to people briefed on the company's investigation.",
