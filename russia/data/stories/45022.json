  "The GDPR requires users to give their consent before personal information is harvested, and Facebook’s data policies no longer allow apps like these to “ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app.” However, assuming such data has already been collected, additional consent is required for it to be sold.",
  "It’s unclear when the internet behemoth actually discovered the breach, but according to The New Yorker, Facebook did send “a polite request to delete the GSR-sourced material.” As polite as the request may have been, it would not have been enough to avoid a huge GDPR fine -- which, in Facebook’s case, could have been billions.",
  "That data doesn’t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.”\n\nWhat If…\n\nHundreds of third-party apps continue piggybacking off social media platforms to track our internet behavior, and there will likely be more stories like this one in the future.",

  "The app claimed to operate in accordance with Facebook’s platform policies, with the understanding that any information collected would be used for academic research only.",
  "Although the collection of data by developers has been restricted, according to The New York Times, “The core functions of Facebook’s open platform tool are still intact.",
  "Data Is Gold\n\nBefore Facebook changed its policies in 2014, plenty of apps used the platform’s data-sharing feature to harvest profile information from unwitting users.",
  "The possibility of another breach affecting millions is very real, and with the GDPR deadline only weeks away, consequences for noncompliance could be devastating.",
  "It all erupted when it was reported that private information from approximately 87 million profiles was used to covertly influence the 2016 U.S. election.",
