  "Prices\n\nCORE: $599/€599/£499\n\nCORE SUB $299/€299/£249\n\nMore info: https://www.massfidelity.com\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions: 6x6x4 inches / 15x15 x10 cm (WxDxH)\n\nMaterial: Chrome, Acrylic, Fabric\n\nAmplifier Power: 120 Watts\n\nFrequency Response: 44Hz-20 kHz\n\nSpeakers: 5x Custom designed high output speaker drivers\n\nPower: AC adaptor & rechargeable battery\n\nBluetooth: Class 1\n\nBluetooth Range: 10 m / 30 ft.",
  "Recognising this change, Mass Fidelity, along with a few other hi-fi manufacturers, has entered the premium wireless speaker market where users use their smartphones as the main source for playing their music and beaming it to an audio device.",
  "The Core Sub costs an extra $299/€299/£249 but it is worth every penny as it beefs out the Core’s excellent treble and midrange and enables the whole set up to comfortably fill even a fairly large room with great sound.",
  "There’s talk that Mass Fidelity is working on a retro-fitted module that will enable the Core to be upgraded to Wi-Fi networking, but as yet there’s no firm details or confirmation on price or expected delivery date.",
  "It is possible to hook up an audio device like a conventional radio tuner, Apple TV, Chromecast or a CD player but the whole set-up could get a bit messy and you’d lose the minimalist appeal of the Core.",
  "There’s no direct USB connection for hooking up an iPod or computer, but if your music is stored on your phone as an AAC file then the Bluetooth provides a perfectly adequate connection.",
  "So, although Bluetooth conveys the audio signal sent to the Core from the smartphone or tablet, the networking between the multiple units is transmitted over a Wi-Fi type network.",
  "The remote is an important plus because being able to mute or change volume without having to grope for your smartphone if the doorbell or house phone rings, is a useful feature.",
  "When you turn the Core on for the first time it goes into pairing mode so you can link the Core to your smartphone, tablet, PC or any other Bluetooth-enabled device.",
  "This is strictly an active loudspeaker with four drivers and a mini sub-woofer that creates a massive room-filling sound with a combined 120 watts of amplification.",
  "Using a technology called Wave Field Synthesis, the Core really can create a realistic stereo soundstage to rival a conventional pair of stereo speakers.",
  "The days of going to a specialist store and buying a stack of separates and a pair of speakers is fast disappearing except for the enthusiast market.",
  "This tiny little black cube, measuring just 6x6x4 inches (15x15 x10 cm), is made from piano-black polycarbonate with a stylish vented chrome base.",
  "These days people want a big sound in a stylish and compact form that fits in with the way we consume music and live our lives in smaller homes.",
  "At the moment, the Naim Muso Qb offers AirPlay facility and Wi-Fi networking for the audio source, so it has the edge in terms of flexibility.",
  "At 8 lb/3.6 kg the Core is heavier than you’d think, mainly due to the built-in battery that supplies up to 10 hours of use between charges.",
  "The shiny black surface is a bit of a fingerprint magnet so the NFC pairing and the minimal controls help to keep the unit looking pristine.",
  "As well as the Bluetooth connection, the Core has inputs for optical and analogue devices, plus there’s a USB port to power your smartphone.",
  "However, if the rumoured Wi-Fi module becomes available, I think the Core will give the Naim’s Muso Qb a really good run for its money.",
  "It’s a very small cube that works as a high-end Bluetooth speaker that can be used on battery power or mains electricity.",
  "This makes it a really flexible audio device but you do need a decent smartphone or tablet to get the best out of it.",
  "Supported Codecs: aptX®, AAC, SBC\n\nMulti-room Network: Adaptive 5 GHz dedicated network\n\nBattery Life: up to 12 hours",
  "Any audio source that you can run on your phone – Spotify, iPlayer, YouTube, Apple Music – can be sent to the Core.",
  "On the plus side, the Mass Fidelity Core has a more focussed stereo soundstage and comes with a remote control.",
  "Its wireless connection is restricted to Bluetooth, albeit a very high-quality implementation of Bluetooth.",
  "All you need to do is press the search button and any other Core unit in range gets added to the network.",
  "When used with the Core Sub it’s an engaging and really musical sound that will have your toes tapping.",
  "There’s also apt-X codec built in if you’re lucky enough to have a device that supports that protocol.",
  "However, I would also recommend that you opt for the Mass Fidelity’s Core Sub-Woofer to go with it.",
  "On the downside, its limitation to just Bluetooth connection could be a bit of a drawback for some.",
  "In an old house like mine with thick walls that’s good news as a Bluetooth network wouldn’t cope.",
  "Like the Muso Qb, it’s possible to network multiple Cores over a built-in 5Ghz adaptive network.",
  "The Core Sub automatically connects to the Core, so once it’s set up there’s little else to do.",
  "Using the optical connection the Core would make a great sound bar for almost any TV.",
  "Mass Fidelity’s offering goes directly head-to-head with the Naim’s Muso Qb.",
  "Verdict\n\nMass Fidelity has created a great-sounding device with the Core.",
  "It’s superb audio quality and stunning good looks are bound to delight.",
  "Mass Fidelity started out as a crowd-funded project from Toronto.",
  "The same goes for adding further Core units in your home.",
  "It’s spent the past couple of years perfecting the Core.",
  "There’s no built-in CD player, tuner or other sources.",
  "Take a listen to the Core with its optional Core Sub.",
  "The way we buy audio is changing."
