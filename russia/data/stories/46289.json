  "In particular, it is remarkable that Facebook’s response was not more along the lines of “Everyone we collected this data from authorized us to collect it by clicking on this button, but we understand that perhaps in the past we haven’t been as clear as we should be about what data we’re collecting, where we’re getting it from and what we’re doing with it and that goes for all the people you called who didn't know the record of their call with you was being recorded and we’re really sorry about that and we’re going to immediately change all of our collection processes to let you know what we’re grabbing from you and help you make more informed decisions about your data and digital identity.",
  "In that light, Facebook’s lawyerly response that by clicking a button, users had essentially signed a digital contract authorizing Facebook to collect this data and store it for as long as it wanted (while avoiding the question about the other side of all those conversations who did not authorize their call record to be harvested and handed to Facebook), was perhaps not the best response to assuage users that anything had changed in its views towards the digital rights of its two billion users.",
  "In particular, it is unclear why Facebook needs to preserve this data for so long, though perhaps it is so that they can generate a general “pattern of life” for each user to understand who they are becoming closer to and who they are drifting apart from and to correlate that call data with their online record of the user to build and tune algorithms that are better able to assess and predict our connection patterns.",
  "After all, one of the central themes of the 50 million harvested Facebook profiles at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story or the untold millions that were harvested by the Obama campaign is that all of the collection was 100% legal and that users had explicitly clicked a button to authorize the harvesting, but that perhaps users didn’t fully understand what they were agreeing to.",
  "Facebook’s official documentation notes that it collects call data both to recommend friend connections and the Orwellian “to help us provide a better service.” Companies like Facebook typically insert such boilerplate sweeping authorizations in their documentation that essentially grant them permission to do anything they might imagine with the data, now or ever in the future.",
  "After all, for Facebook to respond not that it hears us and realizes it needs to do a better job to win back our trust by educating its users on what it is taking from them, but that it is our fault, that we may not have known it, but we clicked a button that gave it permission to grab and keep all this data so tough luck, shows it has learned nothing at all.",
  "In the US a court warrant would grant greater access and more complete data on a user’s movements and communication activities, but Facebook’s centralization of this data at scale offers the tantalizing prospect of mass harvesting CDR data, possibly at global scale across the world someday if Facebook or other social platforms were to revisit the concept.",
  "We’re even going to roll out a tool right at the top of your page that lets you instantly see every data stream we’re ingesting about you, what it says and how to stop it.”\n\nSuch a response would reassure its users that the company had heard them after last week’s public discussion and that its perspective on its users’ digital rights was changed.",
  "Instead of conceding that perhaps users didn't fully understand what they were agreeing to, Facebook’s “fact check” response was that it had indeed collected all of this data, but that users had no right to be upset about it, since they had explicitly granted Facebook permission to harvest it all and save it for as long as the company wanted.",
  "The story that emerged this weekend was both brief and sensational: that some users pouring over their downloaded Facebook data noticed an inexplicable archive of the phone calls they had made from their mobile phones, somehow harvested and archived for posterity by Facebook.",
  "In similar fashion, a single user agreeing to allow Facebook to harvest their call records means that every person they call in the physical world is being connected to them without that person's permission or any knowledge at all that Facebook now has records on them.",
  "Fresh off its week-long response to the Cambridge Analytica story, Facebook made headlines again this weekend when some users downloading their Facebook data archives noticed the company had been harvesting their phone records and archiving them on its own servers.",
  "While no-one should be surprised these days by the sheer volume and intrusive variety of the data collected by Facebook about them, the harvesting of call record data was surprising even to those already accustomed to Facebook’s collection policies.",
  "In the light of NSA and other government surveillance, it also raises the question of whether law enforcement or other government agencies anywhere in the world have ever approached Facebook to access this call data.",
  "For all its assurances that it wants to be worthy and deserving of its users, the company’s tone deaf response to yet another privacy story shows it has learned little from last week’s experience.",
  "Putting this all together, last week’s contrite and apologetic words from the company’s leadership appear to once again be empty words, reflecting no real change in how Facebook views its users.",
  "While the NSA had to go to great lengths to acquire calling records, Facebook apparently has been vacuuming them up right off users’ phones with their full (apparently unknowing) permission.",
  "Coming on the heels of Zuckerberg’s apology tour last week and his promise to do better when it comes to user privacy, the company’s statement might seem a bit tone deaf.",
  "Instead, Facebook’s latest response seems to be nothing more than digging in to its historic approach to harvesting user data with not the slightest lesson learned.",
  "Indeed, as astute readers might recall, more detailed call metadata was at the heart of some of the key conversations around the NSA’s surveillance activities.",
  "Moreover, a key theme was of all of the other users whose data was scooped up without ever being aware of it via harvesting of users' friend graphs.",
  "Users click through these agreements without ever stopping to parse what precisely they’ve handed over and why that permission was necessary.",
  "To truly change itself, Facebook and its social media brethren must stop being technology companies and must be human companies.",
  "To issue a terse “fact check” that both confirmed it had been doing so and blamed it on users giving it permission to do so.",
  "What does Facebook’s response to this latest story tell us about whether anything has changed since Cambridge Analytica?",
  "When asked these questions, the company had not provided comment by publication time.",
  "The company’s response?"
