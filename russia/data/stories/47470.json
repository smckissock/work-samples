  "Many believe that China and indeed Russia’s hybrid, cyber and information practices delve in to digital geopolitical espionage, a notion theorized in Africa in the release of propaganda to support integration in many emerging economies and later copied in the commercial space and in pursuit of information, the currency of the next generation.",
  "Hence, there must be a multi-pronged solution to this problem, prompting advertisers from Nigeria to Nepal to work together, perhaps in the public sector, further regulating browsers hosting such hubs and together reaching for advanced 'Ad-Tech' counter-solutions which make pirated content platforms close to obsolete.",
  "One of the purposes of these agencies may be the collection of information pertaining to visitors of the sites I mention with pirated content to then convert this data to special arbitrators who can later use it for political campaigns, business advertising and other purposes.",
  "The bulk of this “digital illegal trafficking” may take place on websites with pirated music and video content such as Kinogo and Seasonvar and popular torrent trackers like Torrentino and TFile, offering free access to popular American television shows and movies.",
  "As a rule, illegal content distribution hubs position themselves as file-sharing sites so as to hide the true nature of their business, and often similar companies from Ukraine and Russia conduct illegal hacking activities overseas, within the US and EU.",
  "Well, it is clear that without advertisers willing to pay for commercials, propaganda or otherwise, to air on pirated-content-hosting websites, platforms with purportedly unsavory practices such as Adwise, Lucky Labs, AdTech or Playson would not exist.",
  "These piracy hubs are especially popular in Nigeria, Ghana, and other African and Post-Soviet countries, such as Ukraine and Russia, because internet users often want to have access to free pirated movies and games, but this comes at a great price.",
  "However, while Facebook has been linked to the infamous Cambridge Analytica in harvesting user data, many legislators still ignore alternative, smaller sized social media enterprises that operate with impunity.",
  "I recently caught up with Clete Stevens, a renowned American cyber-analyst, to take us through the manipulation of the ‘Internet of Things’ in Africa and around the world, for political and/or commercial gain.",
  "There was a time when the ‘Internet of Things’ served as the scourge of authoritarian and kleptocratic leaders who blamed it for fomenting the Arab Spring and a myriad of color revolutions.",
  "But certain governments may be several steps ahead of the game and that is why the Ukraine attracts more attention in the industry, given its 'cyber accomplishments' in deterrence.",
  "These agencies may slow down or compromise a user’s browsing experience of websites, through the use of pop-up advertisements, and other ethically questionable tactics.",
  "The Social Media platform's algorithm for ranking its newsfeed was then revised, with posts of people close to the account holder having priority over unfamiliar users.",
  "Many social media platforms recognize and register a user’s geo-location, patterns of behavior, interests and preferences, and place tags to sell to advertisers.",
  "However, to date, Russia, China, South Africa, Nigeria and North Korea are nations with citizenry purportedly well-trained as to how to utilize these tools.",
  "For example, an illegal online gambling business was forcibly closed down in Ukraine, a precedent set which can be replicated by many emerging economies.",
  "Facebook recently took action to combat this scourge of ‘fake news’, starting with the creation of a \"dispute\" button, which was later eliminated.",
  "What should internet browsers in Africa and around the world know in order to help combat possible attempts to undermine “digital democracies”?",
  "You mention these “traffic agencies” that illegally collect and sell the personal data of users to third parties - How does this happen?",
  "Companies that monetize internet traffic, such as Adwise, may earn a surcharge on advertising their clients on various sites.",
  "These include 'traffic agencies' that illegally collect and sell the personal data of users to third parties.",
  "Well, firstly, many African nations do not have the technological infrastructure to counter these agencies.",
  "Secondly, the agencies' operatives are well-hidden and their practices are not easy to catch.",
  "As you know, even the United States has made itself massively susceptible to hacking.",
  "Ukraine, has begun resolving the problem of such illegal activities on many fronts.",
  "At the same time, this data collection flies under the radar of the browser.",
  "How do these practices slip by governmental oversight?",
