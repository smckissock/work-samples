  "I met with the inspector general a couple of years ago actually about a broad set of problems involving Weissmann and some of his colleagues in the eastern district of New York that secured convictions of people who were not guilty of the crimes they were convicted of, and frankly, the evidence overwhelming that Mr. Weisman knew that at the time.",

  "So just like he always does, President Trump, he's fighting back and he's fighting back on Twitter to react to Mueller's indictment of these 13 Russian nationals for the 2016 election meddling.",
  "OK, if that's all true given that information, well, that would mean the Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, the DNC, the Clinton campaign and Christopher Steele should all be in serious legal jeopardy.",
