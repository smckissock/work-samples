  "The senator cites a Politico article from January, which alleges that “Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump” by “disseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter…”\n\nHe singles out former DNC official Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American activist, as being “at the center of this plan,” for meeting with Ukrainian Embassy officials in Washington last year, “in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia,” according to Politico.",
  "Given the public reporting of these activities in support of a foreign government, it is imperative that the Justice Department explain why she has not been required to register under FARA.”\n\nHe continues, “FARA requires individuals to register with the Justice Department if they act, even through an intermediary, ‘as an agent, representative, employee, or servant’ or ‘in any other capacity’ at the behest of a foreign principal, including a foreign political party, for purposes of engagement with a United States official.”",
  "“Chalupa’s actions appear to show that she was simultaneously working on behalf of a foreign government, Ukraine, and on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign, in an effort to influence not only the U.S voting population but U.S. government officials,” Grassley wrote.",
  "“Aside from the apparent evidence of collusion between the DNC, Clinton campaign, and Ukrainian government, Chalupa’s actions implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).",
  "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday questioning the Democratic National Committee’s work with Ukrainian politicians.",
