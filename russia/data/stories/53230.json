  "Elena Rybolovleva, once married to Russian fertilizer king Dmitry Rybolovlev , filed papers in 2012 saying a $88 million New York apartment the billionaire bought their 22-year-old daughter Ekaterina was nothing more than a ploy to hide assets in their divorce.",
  "The pricey pad was one of a handful of properties worth an estimated $180 million that the billionaire snapped up between 2008 and 2012 in an attempt -- Elena alleges -- to avoid paying up.",
  "But in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Elena Rybolovleva, his wife of 24 years and mother of his two children, countered that Ekaterina didn't attend school in New York.",
  "When the apartment was purchased in 2011 it made headlines as the most expensive residential property in New York .",
  "Rybolovlev said the pad would be for daughter Ekaterina to live in while she attended college.",
  "It doesn't appear that the duo have yet to settle."
