  "Answer by Ali Ayyash, Co-Founder at Beetoken, on Quora:\n\nWhen news broke that Facebook leaked the data of more than 50 million users to Cambridge Analytica—a third party data firm that is most known for creating profiles with targeting messaging for the Trump campaign—I was shocked.",
  "The new, decentralized platform could have many of the same features—a news feed, group interaction, graphs—but with a much-improved voting process for sorting through “fake news” and protecting personal data.",
  "Bigger Companies Are Getting In The Blockchain Game\n\nWith Google and IBM announcing that they’re beginning work on their own blockchains, this future decentralized social media might not be too far off.",
  "It’s important to keep in mind that this rise in the blockchain doesn’t mean the death of centralized companies—it's just a better move for certain aspects of the organization.",
  "When the user decides to share more data, they would provide friends or third party apps the ability to unlock that data, thus being in full control of who has access to what.",
  "The best solution to that problem would be to replicate some of Facebook’s features by building them on the blockchain, thus creating a decentralized social media platform.",
  "As a developer who has built Facebook-integrated apps in the past, I knew that Facebook had certain measures in place to prevent data breaches like this from happening.",
  "Because of the abilities that come with blockchain, users would have much more say in what data stays private and what data is shared publicly to the blockchain.",
  "We Can Build It\n\nIf this hypothetical blockchain platform existed, people might move toward decentralized social media and away from centralized platforms.",
  "One of the major reasons causing a slow-down in the development process is that Facebook and platforms like it require millions of transactions per second.",
  "This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.",
  "In the meantime, it’s possible to have a partially decentralized Facebook application until the current blockchains mature to allow for further expansion.",
  "A Decentralized Social Media\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that 9 times out of 10, when someone says, “I’m deleting my Facebook,” they don’t actually do it.",
  "This isn’t the first massive data leak to happen in the past few years, and it won’t be the last—it happened again just recently with Under Armour.",
  "That’s because decentralization can help increase user trust—and without the trust from your users, a company will continuously run into trouble.",
  "People want to stay in touch with their friends and family, but there’s no other platform that offers that ability in the way Facebook does.",
  "originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.",
  "All of the data would be on the blockchain, but the user's private data would be encrypted and could only be unlocked by that user.",
  "The combination of stricter criteria for news identification and data sharing means that users’ news feeds would be more reputable.",
  "Even blockchains with more efficient consensus mechanisms like delegated proof of stake fail to reach that huge volume today.",
  "In a few years, however, it could be there, especially with more adoption from bigger companies like Google and Amazon.",
  "Part of the reason for this is because there’s no other platform as big as Facebook for people to go to.",
  "Facebook knew they had vulnerabilities that allowed Cambridge Analytica access to all of that user data.",
  "The problem was, Facebook had no control over what happened to that data once a user gave permission.",
  "Decentralization, through the means of the blockchain, is the future of security and data privacy.",
  "By remaining completely centralized, they continue to run the risk of breaches and leaks.",
  "It doesn’t matter what kind of security measures a company takes—just look at Facebook.",
  "But the good news is, there’s opportunity for prevention using blockchain technologies.",
  "They told them privately to delete it, but, obviously, Cambridge Analytica didn’t.",
  "For example, users had to give permission for the apps to use their data.",
  "They either back out and stay, or create a new account and come back.",
  "Proof-of-work blockchains don’t allow for that many—yet.",
  "You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.",
  "For example, voting, reputation, and sharing content.",
  "Some aspects of this idea already exist in pieces.",
  "What is the solution for data breaches?",
  "But we have to build it first.",
  "So people end up stuck.",
  "This could be huge.",
  "More questions:",
  "Here’s how."
