  "Even though Mexico plans additional rounds of leasing, Duncan says the window of opportunity to get a good deal in Mexico is likely over — a United Nations of bidders descended on Mexico’s most recent shallow water auction last month.",
  "While preparing to drill Zama, Talos and its partners received data from the Mexican government on a well Pemex had drilled in 2009 about 50 miles away into geologic conditions very similar to what they were dealing with at Zama.",
  "Facing dwindling prospects for big new finds offshore, companies have instead flocked to the Permian basin of west Texas, where layer upon layer of oil-saturated rock promises decent returns even at stubbornly low oil prices.",
  "In 2015 they hooked up with U.K.-listed Premier Oil and Sierra Oil & Gas to bid for one of the first prospects offered up by Mexico under the historic oil sector reforms spearheaded by President Enrique Pena Nieto.",
  "Sitting under just 550 feet of water (one tenth the depth of recent deepwater discoveries on the U.S. side), Zama will be relatively cheap to develop, and highly profitable even at $45 oil.",
  "Zama has turned out to be “multiples of what we thought,” says Duncan, similar in size and quality to fields that were discovered in the U.S. gulf back in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.",
  "We will get priced out.”\n\nIt’s far more risky to drill a $50 million wildcat well in a country with a history of oil industry nationalization than a $5 million well onshore in Texas.",
  "After the consortium recoups development costs, Mexico will receive royalties and taxes totalling about 80% of all oil and gas produced — to be worth more than $1 billion a year.",
  "This week Italian oil giant Eni (NYSE:E) announced that it too had found a billion barrels drilling in the Bay of Campeche — a region already known to hold big oil deposits.",
  "But Cantarell has collapsed from 2.2 million bpd in 2003 to about 200,000 bpd today, bringing Mexico’s overall oil output down from about 3.4 million bpd to 2.5 million.",
  "Furthermore, says Duncan, before Zama can be produced they will need to build a lot more infrastructure like subsea pipelines and a production platform.",
  "Sure enough, they found as much as 2 billion barrels of oil trapped in a layer of porous Miocene-era sandstone hundreds of feet thick.",
  "Duncan won’t speculate on eventual production volumes, but fields of this size commonly produce in excess of 100,000 barrels per day.",
  "Duncan and his team previously built and sold two other private equity-based companies, Gryphon Exploration and Phoenix Exploration.",
  "Another big winner is private equity giant Riverstone Holdings, which owns about 40% in each of Talos and Mexico-based Sierra.",
  "The Houston-based oil company has long specialized in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana and Texas.",
  "Earlier this year the partners spudded the Zama-1 well, the first in 80 years not drilled by state monopoly Pemex.",
  "Oil consultancy WoodMackenzie says Zama is one of the 20 biggest new fields discovered in the past 2 decades.",
  "Mexico used to have a booming oil sector thanks to the prodigous output of its offshore megafield Cantarell.",
  "But the Zama discovery shows that for bold explorers, there remain vast oil supplies yet to be discovered.",
  "Says Duncan, “It’s proof that ideas that come with geopolitical risk sometimes work out.”",
  "The grand hope: that the prolific oil trends in U.S. waters extended south of the border.",
  "Riverstone, along with Apollo Global Management, put $600 million into Talos in 2012.",
  "“It’s too big and too shallow to be concerned about the economics,” says Duncan, 44.",
  "It’s been a few years of soul-searching for Tim Duncan, the CEO of Talos Energy.",
  "Premier Oil says they expect commercial production from Zama in about 5 years.",
  "Yet the oil bust that began in 2014 has made the region deeply unpopular.",
  "“We resisted the temptation to join the land race onshore,” says Duncan.",
  "Shares of Premier Oil (LON:PMO) jumped 30% Tuesday on news of the find.",
  "In 2014 they were planning for an IPO, before oil prices collapsed.",
  "Suddenly it looks like Mexico could regain that lost output.",
  "“I can’t compete with the big companies on cost of capital.",
  "Don’t think drilling in Mexico is now a sure thing.",
  "Pulling it all together will take several years.",
  "“We had to go after the first one,” says Duncan.",
  "But Talos did go somewhere new: Mexico.",
  "It will come not a moment too soon.",
  "But that well had turned up dry."
