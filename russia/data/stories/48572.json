  "“It’s not enough for a company to bury some technical lingo in their [terms of service]…It’s not enough to have some convoluted process for opting out.”\n\nFACEBOOK USERS SHOULD EXPECT TO PAY FOR PRIVACY, SANDBERG SAYS\n\nUsers who want to completely opt out of having their data used by advertisers will have to pay for that privilege, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said Friday.",
