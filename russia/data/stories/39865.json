  "When further pressed, she advised to skeptics “to check with Zbigniew Brzezinski.”\n\nWithin a month of the Nataly1001 blog, popular TV host Aleksei Pushkov repeated Albright’s purported remarks on his popular Postscript series: “They attribute the words to Madeleine Albright that ‘Siberia is a too large a territory to belong to one country.’ Even if she did not exactly say this, then she thought it, probably, or someone there did so among the bright people in America.”\n\nSo there you have it: “They attribute,” and “she may not have said it but she or someone else may have said it or thought it.” Sounds like a solid foundation to build foreign policy on, no?",

  "Seven years later, Putin enunciated a similarly vague charge in his December 18, 2014, interview with reporters, broadcast with a simultaneous translation on Russia Today: “We have heard it even from high-level officials that it is unfair that the whole of Siberia with its immense resources belongs to Russia in its entirety.” To which he added a barb: “Why exactly is it unfair?",
