  "But on Sunday, when the Times -- citing three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it -- reported about the lawyer offering to provide information about the Democratic National Committee before he took the meeting, he acknowledged that Democrats and Hillary Clinton were discussed.",
  "We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,\" Trump Jr. initially said in a statement.",
  "\"I'm sorry, he's the President of the United States and you are looking at his ... social media instead of listening to what he does,\" replied Conway, who followed up with: \"Name three things he talked about at the Department of Transportation.\"",
  "Second of all, even if it is true, whether or not it was good information, Kellyanne, doesn't mean it was a smart move to take a meeting with a Russian-connected person who was going to give you negative information about your opponent.",
  "(CNN) White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer in a wide-ranging, 35-minute interview Monday with CNN's Chris Cuomo, saying there was \"no information provided that was meaningful.\"",
  "\"After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,\" Trump Jr. said in the statement.",
  "\"They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption, according to his statements, that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague.",
  "JUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview 34:52\n\nTrump Jr. on Twitter said there were no inconsistencies in his statements.",
  "Throughout the often-tense interview, Conway leveled a sustained attack on the media and CNN in particular, suggesting it was obsessed with the probes into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
  "Cuomo, however, argued that the President's Twitter feed, which often features attacks on the media and commentary on the Russia investigations, was evidence that the issue mattered to him as well.",
  "He defended himself, sarcastically, on Twitter Monday: \"Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.\"",
  "When the paper first reported on the meeting -- but not about the promise of information about Democrats -- he said it was a \"short, introductory meeting\" about adoption.",
  "Conway said the President's son had taken the meeting based on connections made through the Miss Universe pageant and promises of a conversation about adoption policy.",
  "It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.\"",
  "He added, \"She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act.",
  "He said the lawyer had \"no meaningful information\" to offer him, adding that he was not told her name prior to the meeting.",
  "\"Aren't you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed, that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?\"",
  "\"Let's focus on what did not happen in that meeting,\" she said, speaking on \"New Day,\" adding there was \"no action taken.",
  "\"Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he didn't even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,\" she said.",
  "Trump Jr. changed his account of events as he was presented with new reporting by The New York Times.",
  "\"I asked (Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner) and (then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort) to stop by.",
  "You talked about being in a court of law -- not good when you change your story,\" Cuomo said.",
  "I'm not here to bash CNN,\" she said, adding, \"We need to find a way to work together better.\"",
  "Despite her sharp words, however, Conway said twice she had not come on air to attack CNN.",
  "\"The President spends as much time tweeting about this as anything else,\" said Cuomo.",
  "\"I admire your moxie, sitting there with the CNN chyron next to you,\" she replied.",
  "\"I could not be more proud to have that CNN chyron next to me,\" Cuomo fired back.",
  "\"He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.\"",
  "She said he did not even know the name of the lawyer going into the meeting.",
  "No details or supporting information was provided or even offered.",
  "\"There are big implications when you change your story like this.",
  "It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\"",
  "Cuomo, however, seized on the changes in Trump Jr.'s story.",
  "\"Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense.",
  "\"I simply provided more details,\" he tweeted Monday.",
  "It's not filled with ideas for new jobs.",
  "\"I'll show you his thread right now.",
  "That could create huge legal issues.",
  "\"We appreciate the platform, Chris.",
  "He's on this stuff as well.\"",
  "\"He changed his story twice.",
  "They were meaningless.\"",
  "You know that.\"",
  "Conway asked.",
  "But, look ...",
  "Nothing.\""
