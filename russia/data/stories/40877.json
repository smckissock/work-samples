  "We will put an end to attempts of imposing democracy and overthrowing regimes abroad, as well as involving ourselves in situations in which we have no right to intervene.”\n\nLet’s hope Trump can maintain that position in the face of inevitable militaristic advice from Mattis, Flynn and Pompeo.",
  "During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to reinstitute waterboarding, saying he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” because suspected terrorists “deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.”\n\nWaterboarding has long been considered torture, which is a war crime.",
  "ANTONIO SCORZA via Getty Images Iraqi General Mohammed Latif (R), head of the Fallujah Brigade, gestures as he stands near US Marines General James Mattis during a joint press conference 20 May at the Fallujah Liaison Team Building, west of Baghdad 20 May 2004.",

  "Yet, according to the Study Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, the US attack on Fallujah in November 2004 killed between 4,000 and 6,000 civilians.",
  "Trump told The New York Times that when he asked Mattis what the general thought of waterboarding, Mattis replied, “I’ve never found it to be useful.",
