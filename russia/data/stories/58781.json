  "A lawyer for Trump Jr. declined to comment, but referred NBC News to the statement his client released in September, which said Trump Jr. wanted to \"hear (the Russians) out\" if they had information concerning Clinton's \"fitness, character or qualifications.\"",

  "Previously, she told NBC News she had raised the issue of potential questionable contributions to Clinton's campaign by Americans accused in Russia of tax evasion.",
  "\"Today, I understand why it took place to begin with and why it ended so quickly with a feeling of mutual disappointment and time wasted,\" Veselnitskaya wrote.",
