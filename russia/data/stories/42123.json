  "However, the U.S. embassy in New Delhi is playing coy about repercussions, issuing a statement that the CAATSA was not intended to “impose damage to the military capabilities of our allies or partners.” And as the United States is very keen to make India its partner in an alliance to contain China’s military expansion, most observers expect the law will be selectively waived.",
  "On October 5, 2018, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Russian president Vladimir Putin signed off in New Delhi on a deal to transfer five advanced S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems in exchange for $5.43 billion—Delivery of the S-400s is to follow in two years.",
  "In the post–Soviet era, the Indian military continues to rely on Russian hardware for top weapon systems such as the T-90 tank, Su-30MKI Flankers and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, both nuclear and diesel-electric submarines, and even an extraordinarily bad aircraft carrier.",
  "Ordinarily such a transaction would trigger sanctions from the United States due to the passage in 2017 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which stipulates punishments for countries that purchase Russian military equipment.",
  "As Washington is selling dozens of F-35 stealth fighters to Ankara, the Pentagon is particularly worried that the S-400 systems in Turkey could be used to study the stealth jet’s radar signature and possibly even hack into its computers.",
  "Quite simply, while the U.S. military expects its fighter planes to seize air superiority, Russian ground forces have never taken control of the skies for granted and invested much more in ground-based anti-aircraft systems.",
  "Such inconsistency may soon have rippling repercussions, however, as it will weaken the credibility of U.S. sanctions on its NATO partner of Turkey, which is also purchasing S-400s over strenuous objections from Washington.",
  "In 1971, Soviet-built T-55 and PT-76 tanks, Mi-4 helicopters, MiG-21 jet fighters and Styx anti-ship missiles played a major role in India’s defeat of Pakistani forces in what is now Bangladesh.",
  "U.S. surface-to-air missile development in the last two decades has focused on countering ballistic missiles, which are not susceptible to fighter interception.",
  "Using its longest range missiles, an S-400 can threaten aircraft up to two hundred miles away—while at best the Patriot radius of action comes to half that.",
  "The summer of 2017, the U.S. Congress passed a defense authorization act blocking transfer of F-35s in 2019 (but not before) pending further review.",
  "A Soviet fleet even faced down an American carrier task force dispatched to the Indian Ocean to pressure New Delhi into calling off the offensive.",
  "Additionally, India will spend $2.2 billion to purchase four Russian missile frigates and negotiate license-manufacture of AK-103 assault rifle.",
  "When the United States imposed an arms embargo on India due to the 1965 Indo-Pakistani conflict, the Soviet Union stepped into the gap.",
  "Giving India a waiver for its S-400 purchase will certainly reinforce the impression that sanctions will only be selectively applied.",

  "In fact, just a month earlier in September CAATSA sanctions were imposed on China for its purchase of Su-35 Flanker-E fighters .",

  "The Pentagon has deployed ABM-capable systems such as the Patriot PAC-3 MSE, THAADS, GMD and the Navy’s SM-3.",
  "But if you’re more concerned by enemy aircraft, the Russian systems probably offer the best bang for buck.",
  "India has a very long military relationship with Russia dating back to the the height of the Cold War.",
  "However, both the Pentagon and Lockheed seem confident the Turkish F-35 deal will still go through.",
