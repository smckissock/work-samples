  "As the tally of Russian provocations has grown, from the annexation of Crimea and destabilization of Ukraine in 2014, to election interference in the United States and elsewhere, to the heedless use of airpower against civilian targets in Syria, the sense that something had to be done had been building.",
  "Nonetheless, as the remaining Russian agents scramble to absorb their departing colleagues’ sources and workloads, the wave of expulsions will inevitably disrupt both intelligence-gathering networks as well as “active measures,” or political subversion operations.",
  "This latest affair, an especially brazen incident which saw not only Skripal, but his daughter and a police officer who came to their aid poisoned with a Soviet-designed military nerve agent, simply provided the catalyst.",
  "This time, despite the Trump administration’s often-tense relations with Europe and the fraught negotiations over Britain’s divorce from the European Union, the West has delivered an unprecedented collective message.",
  "While outright invasions such as the seizure of Crimea have led to sanctions, this is the first time ever there has been such an extensive and international response to a covert operation.",
  "When its agents poisoned defector Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, for example, Britain received little real support from its allies when it pushed back against Russia.",
  "The more than 120 expelled individuals, all presumed to be intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover, represent only a fraction of Russia’s intelligence apparatus.",
  "Britain’s initial response, while decried by the Russian authorities as an act of “Russophobia,” did not seem to faze people I spoke to connected with the foreign ministry.",
  "Even the horrific shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 over southeast Ukraine by Russian proxies using a Russian missile failed to generate a similar reaction.",
  "The idea that 17 EU countries, as well as Albania, Australia, Canada, Macedonia, Norway, and Ukraine, would end up expelling suspected agents seemed implausible.",
  "In the Czech Republic, for example, the security service has claimed that as many as 50 Russians working in the embassy in Prague are actually spies.",
  "These activities range from encouraging anti-government paramilitary groups in Bulgaria to supporting populist far-right fringe groups in Europe.",
  "But, mindful that their much smaller embassy in Moscow can only sustain a few retaliatory expulsions, the Czechs expelled just three Russians.",
  "When Russian commandos kidnapped Estonian security officer Eston Kohver in 2014, Tallinn had to cut its own deal with Moscow to get him back.",
  "Perhaps most importantly, these expulsions challenge any easy assumptions in Moscow that Russian officials have the measure of the West.",
  "Each time, allies offered little more than sympathy, and Putin presumably assumed this would again be the case with Skripal.",
  "This new determination from the West to take Putin to task is the product of a cumulative process.",
  "In previous incidents of Russian mischief, Moscow has only had to deal with one country at a time.",
  "When assassins killed Chechen activists in Istanbul, no one rushed to help the Turks.",
  "They all seemed certain that that initial expulsion would be the end of it.",
  "I was in Moscow in the immediate aftermath of the Skripal attack.",
  "The expulsions also shift the geopolitical landscape.",
  "That America would also kick out another 60?",
  "Unthinkable."
