  "When asked if had ever met Trump, Millian acknowledged that he had and said that “there was only one meeting” regarding “strategy and marketing opportunities for the Trump Hollywood project in Florida.”\n\nHe said that the meeting occurred “about 10 years ago,” but he complained that “the media portrays these events and meeting as if it happened yesterday.”\n\n***\n\nOn the same day that ABC released its transcript of the Millian interview, the alleged dossier source was a topic of discussion during Justice Department official Bruce Ohr’s congressional testimony about his contacts with Steele and Simpson.",
  "ABC News has released a transcript of a two-year-old interview with Sergei Millian, a Belarus-born businessman who is said to be a major source for the Steele dossier\n\nIn the interview, Millian remarked that Donald Trump had “tricks up his sleeve” to win the 2016 election\n\nMillian’s credibility has come under question, however, including from Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS\n\nAn obscure Belarusian-American businessman made cryptic remarks about President Donald Trump in an interview with ABC News in July 2016 during the heat of the presidential campaign.",
  "Ohr’s notes show that Simpson told him about “possible intermediaries” between the Trump campaign and Russian government as well as a “longtime associate of Trump” who “put together several real estate deals for Russian investigators to purchase Trump properties.” Millian was identified as the purported intermediary and Trump associate.",
  "ABC News and The Wall Street Journal reported that Millian was Source D. The Journal and The Washington Post have also reported that Millian is identified in parts of the dossier as “Source E.” That source claimed that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was the campaign’s liaison to the Kremlin.",
  "Ross, who has since left ABC News after bungling a story about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, was able to interview Millian about his knowledge of Trump’s links to Russia as well as his own possible ties to Russian intelligence agencies.",
  "But the burning question about Millian is whether the businessman was telling the truth in the interview or when he unwittingly spoke to an intermediary who reported back to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.",
  "(RELATED: Fusion GPS Doubted The Credibility Of A Major Dossier Source)\n\nDespite his doubts, Simpson tipped off ABC’s Ross to Millian’s purported links to Trump and his real estate company, The Trump Organization.",
  "Several days before the interview, Millian reached out to and met with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with a mysterious Maltese professor.",

  "Papadopoulos’ attorneys said in a court filing submitted on Aug. 31 that FBI agents initially quizzed Papadopoulos about Millian during a Jan. 27, 2017 interview.",

  "But instead of discussing hacked DNC emails, Millian pivoted to a discussion about emails that Clinton deleted from her private email server.",
  "In the interview with Ross, Millian said that he was in Moscow at the same time as Trump but that he did not accompany the real estate mogul.",
  "It took place two days before the FBI opened its investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.",
  "Two days before the interview, Trump made his now-infamous plea to the Russian government to track down Clinton’s missing emails.",
  "“You think so?” ABC’s Ross asked Millian, according to a transcript of the interview, which was released in full on Aug. 28.",
  "In October 2016, WikiLeaks began publishing emails hacked from the Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.",
  "And even Glenn Simpson, the opposition researcher who hired Steele to dig up dirt on Trump, reportedly doubted Millian.",
  "“If [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wanted to support Donald Trump, he would share those emails that got deleted.",
  "Millian’s credibility has been called into question, and he has been accused of exaggerating his links to Trump.",
