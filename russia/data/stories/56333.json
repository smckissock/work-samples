  "Washington (CNN) The leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee have cut a deal with President Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to avoid being subpoenaed for a high-profile public hearing next week, with the two men agreeing to provide records to the panel and to be privately interviewed ahead of any public session.",
  "In a joint statement, panel Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dianne Feinstein said, \"(W)e will not issue subpoenas for them tonight requiring their presence at Wednesday's hearing but reserve the right to do so in the future.\"",
  "Last week, Trump Jr. told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he would testify under oath about his recently revealed 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians, where he attempted to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.",
  "But after the Senate Judiciary Committee invited him to attend a public hearing, the President's eldest struck the agreement to avoid it, instead going behind closed doors.",
  "Feinstein tweeted later Friday evening, \"The Judiciary Committee will talk to Trump Jr. & Manafort before they testify in public, but we will get answers.\"",
