  "(Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — New questions about the ultimate goal and the extent of Russia's intrusions into U.S. political institutions continued to emerge Monday after intelligence officials briefed lawmakers last week with the dramatic assessment that Russian hackers sought to tilt last month's general election to President-elect Donald Trump.",
  "The questions over hacking have thrust Russia, which long loomed as a potential threat to the integrity of the general election, back into center of U.S. national security concerns, as Trump assembles key appointees for his administration, including the pending announcement on his choice for secretary of State.",
  "“We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,” Obama’s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters Friday.",
  "Those hacks— which produced a trove of embarrassing internal communications for public distribution on the websites DCLeaks and WikiLeaks — led to the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the national convention.",
  "A review of how the issue escalated, with Russia now suspected of attempting to sway the election in Trump's favor and what happens next:\n\nQ: How did last week's intelligence assessment differ from previous reports about Russia's hacking of U.S. political institutions?",
  "Trump has dismissed the conclusions outright, and the FBI has suggested that the assessment — while possibly accurate — so far lacks definitive evidence necessary, said two U.S. officials who are not authorized to comment publicly.",
  "CLOSE Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemns Russian hacking of U.S. political organizations, as President-elect Donald Trump continues to downplay the CIA’s confidential assessment that Russia hacked into the DNC.",
  "The October finding, announced by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, concluded that the disclosures were \"intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.''",
  "Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and FBI Director James Comey, have said that the decentralized nature of voting systems across the U.S. poses a difficult target for hackers.",
  "While the CIA develops assessments based on a broad interpretation of available data, the FBI, as a law enforcement agency, requires a standard of proof that could sustain a possible criminal prosecution.",
  "There have been differences, the official said, in how much weight to ascribe a range of possible motives: Were the Russians specifically seeking to tilt the election in favor of Trump?",
  "\"In our judgment, it would be very difficult to alter a ballot count in any one place and have a significant consequence,'' Johnson said in an interview last month with USA TODAY.",
  "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that two Senate committees would investigate the CIA's new assessment of Russia's involvement.",
  "\"Obviously, any foreign breach of our cyber-security measures is disturbing and I strongly condemn any such efforts,\" McConnell told reporters Monday.",
  "The conclusion is that Republican Party computer systems also may have been breached, but that internal information was not distributed publicly.",

  "While not dismissing the intelligence community's conclusion, the official said a more definitive determination has not yet been reached.",

  "Q: On what points of the new Russian assessment do the CIA and other intelligence authorities differ with the FBI?",
  "He said the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct bipartisan reviews.",
  "Late Monday, a third Senate panel, the Foreign Relations Committee, also indicated it will review the matter.",
  "A: The Obama administration has ordered a review of attempts by foreign hackers to influence U.S. elections.",
  "The difference lies in the institutional standards the agencies require in reaching such conclusions.",
  "Or was the operation a hedging of bets to sow confusion and undermine confidence in the process?",
