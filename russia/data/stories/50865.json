  "Netanyahu was quick to fire back, calling the speech “biased against Israel.” It was an immediate, furious reaction, just like Netanyahu’s response to the Security Council vote, when he accused the Obama administration of a “shameful ambush.” On Christmas Day, after the Foreign Ministry summoned diplomats from each Security Council member to deliver a demarche, the prime minister hauled in Dan Shapiro, the U.S. ambassador, for his own 40-minute reprimand.",
  "They were warned that Knesset members might heckle them on their visit to parliament later that week; one member of the ruling coalition had recently referred to Reform Jews as “mentally ill.” And they feared that the warfare between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama, particularly the prime minister’s fierce campaign against the Iran deal, was doing irreparable damage to the U.S.-Israeli relationship.",
  "As Kerry said in his speech, “if the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both.”\n\nIn September, Netanyahu announced at the General Assembly that Israel had broadened its diplomatic relations, not just with traditional allies in the West, but with emerging powers and markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America.",
  "He has been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League for peddling “anti-Muslim bigotry.” Gaffney’s views have a following in Trump Tower: Steve Bannon, the president-elect’s senior counselor, hosted Gaffney on his radio show dozens of times, and there were reports that he was brought in to advise the transition (though Trump’s team denied it).",
  "Oren Hazan, a lawmaker from Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud, said the vote “brought out the Hussein in Obama.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“It is sad because our most important ally has abandoned a policy which has existed since 1967,” said Michael Oren, a former ambassador in Washington, D.C., who is now a lawmaker from the centrist Kulanu party.",
  "He has channeled the worst aspects of Israel’s political culture, like his election-day warning about Arabs “coming to the polls in droves.” On top of that, Netanyahu has done little to address the issues, like the Western Wall or the recognition of non-Orthodox conversions, that American Jews view as important.",
  "Rather, Netanyahu is trying to fend off challengers from an increasingly fractious and hawkish right—from those who don’t think Israeli expansion is moving fast enough—and hopes a dramatic campaign against the United Nations and the Obama administration will help him do that.",
  "“They are unnecessary, because this goes without saying.”\n\nThe younger Begin followed in his father’s footsteps, denouncing the outpost bill as a “land grab.” After the vote, coalition whip David Bitan suspended him from his parliamentary committees for breaking discipline.",
  "In a 75-minute address at the State Department on Wednesday, the secretary of state outlined a long list of reasons why the two-state solution was on its deathbed, and defended last week’s abstention from a controversial Security Council vote on Israeli settlements.",
  "Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did too, but both men changed their minds once in office: The status of the holy city is meant to be resolved in a final peace settlement, and advisers convinced these two presidents that the move would be an unnecessary provocation.",

  "And just as President-elect Trump said yesterday, it will happen much sooner than you think.”\n\nBut the embrace of Trump and the belligerence toward the rest of the world that Netanyahu is using to woo right-wing voters carries a profound risk.",
  "Even more worrisome for Israel, however, is the growing alienation of American Jews, who find it more and more difficult to support a religious, right-wing government that they perceive as supporting Israeli racism and endless occupation.",
  "“We want to maintain our distance and focus on other issues.”\n\nIsrael’s newest allies, in other words, are happy to increase trade, tourism and security cooperation—but when it comes to diplomacy, they won’t stick their necks out.",
  "The group’s founder, Frank Gaffney, is a conspiracy theorist who believes that Obama is part of a secret Muslim Brotherhood plot to infiltrate the U.S government, a scheme that also involves anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.",
  "Implausible as it sounds, it may be Trump and Netanyahu, two men who profess to be Israel’s strongest defenders, who definitively shatter the “unbreakable alliance” and rupture the decades-old bipartisan consensus on Israel.",
  "Netanyahu is forced to rely on smaller, more conservative right-wing parties for additional support—which empowers his more ideological opponents, most notably Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler party, Jewish Home.",
  "On December 5—at Netanyahu’s behest, but with Bennett leading the public campaign—the Knesset gave preliminary approval for the “regulation bill,” which retroactively legalized thousands of such houses across the West Bank.",
  "And then they hear this other piece, and something doesn’t add up for them.”\n\nThe Brookings Institution, in its annual surveys presented at the Saban Forum, has found a widening partisan gap among the general public.",
  "Most Israelis are tired of the ever-growing list of scandals swirling around his office, but he still plans to run for a fifth term, and perhaps more: He talks occasionally about his vision for the next decade.",
  "“He made it very clear during the campaign … and as president-elect I've heard him repeat it several times privately, if not publicly.” His team has already started scouting possible locations for the embassy.",
  "“And we keep insulting them.”\n\n“[Netanyahu] thinks that he knows the United States better than anybody else in this country,” said Efraim Halevy, a former Mossad director who became a fierce Netanyahu critic.",
  "Days after the plan was approved, in a revealing sign of Netanyahu’s priorities, the government announced a roughly equivalent cut to the budget for education, health care and grants to local authorities.",
  "But the war in Lebanon, and the violence of the intifada, shattered their “romantic idealization.”\n\n“Now Israel reveals itself, a nation like all the others,” he wrote in his diary, published years later.",
  "Trump has also made it clear that he will oppose critical resolutions at the U.N., and it is hard to imagine his press secretary or his secretary of state condemning new construction in the settlements.",
  "A majority of Democrats (with whom 70 percent of Jews identify) now believe the Jewish state has too much influence on U.S. foreign policy and support imposing economic sanctions over the\n\nsettlements.",
  "“Naturally we shall not make any announcements, which are completely unnecessary, saying that the Supreme Court’s decision should be respected,” he said at a Cabinet meeting shortly after the verdict.",
  "But it will be an era in which the two leaders, aligned with the far right of the pro-Israel establishment, pursue policies that will erode Israel’s support in the U.S. and its standing in the world.",
  "Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that an Israeli lawmaker called Donald Trump the Messiah; in fact, the lawmaker said that Trump’s victory heralded the Messiah.",
  "envoy David Friedman will be among the demonstrators.”\n\n***\n\nAll of this could make for the beginnings of a major shift in Israeli politics—ironically, one that the prime minister never wanted.",
  "For all their personal animosity, Obama was actually a great help in this respect: Netanyahu invoked his name in Cabinet meetings like a father warning his unruly children about the boogeyman.",
  "Back in February, in a private meeting with the Reform rabbis, Netanyahu briefed them on the regional situation, describing the threat from “medieval” groups like the Islamic State and Hamas.",
  "He laid most of the blame on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government, whose policies, he argued, were pushing Israel toward a binational state with the Palestinians.",
  "Which is why the furious responses to resolution 2334 and Kerry’s speech have almost nothing to do with the merits of the settlement program—and everything to do with domestic politics.",

  "Back in the late 1980s, as the first intifada erupted in Israel and the occupied territories, Albert Vorspan was troubled by the “harvest of rage” on his television screen each night.",

  "TEL AVIV—It was a valedictory speech, irrelevant in a few weeks, but John Kerry’s much-anticipated remarks on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were still a remarkable indictment.",
  "That was why, for a month before the U.N. vote, Netanyahu was consumed with the plight of 40 Israeli families living illegally on a hilltop outside of Ramallah in the West Bank.",
  "But Israel’s conservatives, especially the younger ones, are increasingly religious and nationalist, and so Netanyahu faces a growing list of challengers who check the same box.",
  "Indeed, his ambassador at the United Nations, Danny Danon—an opponent of the two-state solution—was dispatched to Turtle Bay to take him out of Israeli politics for a few years.",
  "“The resolution that was passed at the U.N. yesterday is part of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel,” Netanyahu said in a vitriolic speech on Saturday.",
  "And, at a news conference last year, Bennett said that Asian countries could become Israel’s closest friends, because they “lack a heritage of anti-Semitism” found in the West.",
  "Thus, his main selling point to voters—his only one, really—is that he is a tough, pragmatic nationalist who will stand up to the Palestinians and the international community.",
  "And while several retired generals are thought to be keen for one final mission to unseat Netanyahu, they have yet to find a political home that would enable them to do so.",
  "And the Israeli government’s embrace of a president-elect (and his controversial political coterie) loathed by the vast majority of American Jews will only widen the chasm.",
  "For example, a November poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 44 percent of Israeli Jews support annexation of the full West Bank, with just 38 percent opposed.",

  "It was seen as a hard-fought victory for activists like these rabbis, who worked for decades to challenge the gender segregation enforced by the ultra-Orthodox rabbinate.",
  "In his eight years in power (plus a three-year stint in the 1990s), he has done little to resolve Israel’s economic problems, or its myriad social and cultural arguments.",

  "Amona had been dismantled once before, in 2006, and Likud used footage of the violent evacuation against the center-left Ehud Olmert in the subsequent general election.",
  "Others want to go further: After the U.N. vote, Bennett renewed his call for Israel to annex “Area C,” a designation that covers two-thirds of the occupied West Bank.",
  "***\n\nNetanyahu is Israel’s second-longest-serving prime minister, and though he is often portrayed as an ideologue, his main goal often seems to be self-preservation.",
  "And if he keeps his word—if Trump governs the way he campaigned—then he will promote policies that are deeply unpopular with many Americans, including American Jews.",
  "Yair Lapid, the head of the centrist Yesh Atid, recently surged in the polls, but mostly at Labor’s expense; he would struggle to put together a working coalition.",
  "It’s not that the size of the right-wing/religious bloc in Israel has changed much—conservatives have made up the same portion of the population since the 1980s.",
  "“That is, a small but significant minority of the Jewish public supports a situation that the international community regards as apartheid,” the pollsters noted.",

  "In Israel, where the conservative Likud has been solidly in power for much of the past four decades, the peace process is no longer a major political issue.",
  "Israel often claims that “shared values” unite it with America; how can it continue to do so if Israel’s top representatives embrace figures like Gaffney?",
  "The elder Begin was a Revisionist, a supporter of settlements and “greater Israel,” but also a proponent of the rule of law and the separation of powers.",
  "Asked whether the U.S. is “too supportive” of Israel, a quarter of the Jewish millennials said yes, compared with just 5 percent of their grandparents.",
