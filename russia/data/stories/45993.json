  "Collins: We still want Zuckerberg to answer UK lawmakers' questions 7:29 AM ET Wed, 28 March 2018 | 02:10\n\nU.K. lawmakers sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Wednesday asking for clarification on whether he would eventually appear in front of them, after the social network agreed to send two of his deputies instead.",
  "Last week, Damian Collins, the chair of the British parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, asked Zuckerberg to appear in front of lawmakers to \"give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process\" related to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.",
  "A quiz app harvested 50 million Facebook profiles for data which were then sent over to Cambridge Analytica, a firm that was caught claiming it handled the digital aspects of President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.",
  "\"However, given the seriousness of these issues we still believe that Mark Zuckerberg himself is the right person to give evidence,\" he said in a letter to Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of public policy.",
  "Instead of Zuckerberg, Facebook said it would send either its Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, to appear in front of U.K. lawmakers.",
  "On Wednesday, Collins said he accepted the offer of evidence from Cox, and suggested the Facebook executive answer U.K. lawmakers' questions on April 24.",
  "\"Mr Zuckerberg has stated in interviews that if he is the right person to appear, he will appear.",
  "He appears to have acted on this belief with respect to appearing before Congress.",
  "We now request confirmation as to whether he will make the same decision for us.\"",
  "Collins has given Zuckerberg until April 9 to respond."
