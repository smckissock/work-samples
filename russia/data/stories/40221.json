  "\"We can't blame Trump or the Trump administration for taking so long to come up with a policy because in my view there really are no good policies for Afghanistan at this point,\" said Michael Kugelman, a deputy director and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank.",
  "Similarly, Defense Secretary James Mattis testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee in June that the U.S. was \"not winning in Afghanistan,\" after about 16 years and he indicated that a winning strategy will mean a \"change in our approach\" and an \"era of frequent skirmishing.\"",
  "Prince, who served as a Navy Seal in the 1990s, pointed out in the Journal piece that \"the coalition has had 17 different military commanders in the past 15 years, which means none of them had time to develop or be held responsible for a coherent strategy.\"",
  "According to NBC News, the president during a July 19 meeting \"repeatedly suggested\" to his military advisors that they should replace Army Gen. John Nicholson, the current top U.S. commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan.",
  "Trump inherited the war from two previous presidents but lawmakers, including Arizona Republican McCain, have been critical of the current administration for failing to come up with a new strategy for the Afghanistan conflict.",
  "During his June testimony to the Senate committee, however, Mattis indicated Congress should have the new strategy by mid-July but there's still debate within the administration over what the new strategy should be.",
  "On Thursday, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz) expressed support for Nicholson in a statement, saying the general \"has served our country with honor and distinction for 35 years.",
  "It also reported that Trump vented to Mattis that he's given military authority to the retired general to make changes in the Afghanistan strategy but it still didn't change the situation for the better.",
  "McCain also urged Trump \"to resolve the differences within his administration as soon as possible and decide on a policy that can achieve our national security interests in Afghanistan and the region.",
  "Kugelman added that the president probably has reason to be frustrated because he's been shown some ideas of things that have already been tried by previous administrations — and that haven't worked.",
  "If the president fails to do this by the time the Senate takes up the defense authorization bill in September, I will offer an amendment to that legislation, which will provide such a strategy.\"",
  "NBC News said the president made the suggestion about replacing Nicholson to Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, and Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs.",
  "President Donald Trump , frustrated that the U.S. is \"losing\" in Afghanistan, is considering replacing the American military commander leading the campaign, according to a report.",
  "\"There are too many cooks in the kitchen — and the cooks change shift annually,\" former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal back in May.",
  "The U.S. has spent well over $800 billion fighting in the conflict and there have been more than 2,400 U.S. military fatalities and tens of thousands of soldiers wounded.",
  "Some have suggested what's needed is to consolidate the management structure of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan to something akin of a Gen. Douglas MacArthur approach.",
  "The U.S. military has been fighting in Afghanistan since 2001 but the security situation in the country remains dangerous and increasingly volatile.",
  "Previously, Nicholson requested the administration increase the number of U.S. soldiers fighting the battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
  "Last week, at least 35 people were killed in a bomb attack in the capital Kabul that was claimed by the Taliban.",
  "\"So sending more troops may have more tactical advantages, but ultimately it won't win the war.\"",
  "On Wednesday, two American service members were killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan.",
  "Nicholson formally assumed command of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan in March 2016.",
  "\"Most people agree there's no military solution to the war,\" said Kugelman.",
  "He has earned the trust and admiration of those he has served with.",
  "\"We aren't winning,\" Trump reportedly said during the meeting.",
  "The Pentagon didn't return calls for comment.",
  "It cited senior administration officials.",
  "And he has earned my full confidence.\"",
  "\"We are losing.\"",
