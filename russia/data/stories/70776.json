  "Russia has signed a deal with Iran to build two new nuclear reactors at the Bushehr plant, pictured, and expand the total number of reactors in the country to eight Â© AFP/File Atta Kenare Vienna (AFP) - Iran's foreign minister considered Friday returning to Tehran for \"consultations\" following talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry, three days before a deadline to strike a landmark nuclear deal with world powers.",
  "\"I think Zarif is going back to bring the results of his meeting with Kerry, which could have opened up the door for movement on the remaining issues, and to receive instructions about the parameters that he has to negotiate with,\" she told AFP.",
  "Iran and the six powers -- the US, China, Russia, Britain, France plus Germany -- have been negotiating intensively since February to turn an interim accord with Iran reached a year ago into a lasting agreement before November 24.",
  "Kerry himself was also due later Friday to leave the high-stakes ongoing talks in Vienna for Paris for talks with European counterparts and will \"stay in close touch\" with Washington, State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said.",
  "\"The prize for Iran is huge -- access to very large amounts of frozen assets, the ability to trade freely with the world again and the ability to reset relationships with the international community,\" Hammond said.",
  "French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius joined the talks in the Austrian capital Friday urging Iran to \"seize this opportunity\" for a deal while British counterpart Philip Hammond called for Iranian \"flexibility\".",
  "Such a deal, after 12 years of rising tensions, is aimed at easing fears that Tehran will develop nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian activities -- an ambition the Islamic republic has denied.",
  "Russia's main negotiator in the talks, Sergei Ryabkov, said Thursday that the talks were being held in a \"tense atmosphere\" and agreeing the mammoth accord would be \"very difficult without a new spirit\".",
  "\"His future travel schedule is still being finalised, and we have not yet determined when he will return to Vienna,\" Psaki said as Kerry ended a meeting with Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif.",
  "Hammond had said on Wednesday that he was \"not optimistic\" the deadline could be met, suggesting that the best hope was for another extension -- and provided there was \"some significant movement\".",
  "Iran wants to massively ramp up the number of enrichment centrifuges -- in order, it says, to make fuel for a fleet of future reactors -- while the West wants them dramatically reduced.",
  "But two key issues remain: enrichment -- a process that renders uranium suitable for peaceful uses but also, at high purities, for a weapon; and the pace of the lifting of sanctions.",
  "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Moscow Friday that \"all the elements are already on the table\" for a deal and called on negotiators to \"show political will\".",
  "Iran's speaker of parliament Ali Larijani meanwhile told Iranian media on Thursday: \"We are constantly cooperating (but the other side) is raising the tone.\"",
  "\"I think the fact that he is going shows that they are close, serious and intent on reaching an agreement by November 24,\" Davenport told AFP.",
  "Kelsey Davenport, an expert at the Arms Control Association, said it was a \"positive sign\" that Zarif might be returning to Iran.",
  "- Complex deal -\n\nHe added: \"We hope that the other side will behave in a rational manner... and won't take the wrong path.\"",
  "Some areas appear provisionally settled in what would be a highly complex deal that would run for many years, even decades.",
  "\"Zarif will perhaps return this evening to Tehran for consultations,\" a source close to the Iranian negotiators said.",
  "The six world powers want however to stagger any suspension to be sure that Iran does not renege on its commitments.",
  "He warned, though, that \"we have a long way to go if we are to get to a deal before the deadline on Monday\".",
  "Most analysts expect Iran and the six powers to decide to extend the deadline.",
  "\"Flexibility\" from the Iranians was needed and would be reciprocated.",
  "It's that simple,\" Kerry said in Paris before he went to Vienna.",
  "But Kerry on Thursday insisted this was not on the table.",
  "Diplomats say Iran wants all sanctions lifted at once.",
  "We are negotiating to have an agreement.",
  "However \"time is short,\" he stressed.",
  "\"We are not discussing an extension."
