  "You know, the thing that I think was the most shocking to most of us who watch this whole process was, you know, the first degree, the second degree murder charges went by, but the involuntary manslaughter was the one that is really hard to understand, and I'd like you to tell us why you think the jury went the way it did.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Conyers' attorney, meanwhile tonight, denying Politico's claim that the Black Caucus had brokered a deal whereby a lawmaker was going to read a letter of apology on the House floor last Friday and revealed Conyers would retire at the end of the year so he could try to leave with some dignity.",

  "But this is what the writer, J.R. Gamble had to say about, let's put up on the screen: \"I guess because he isn't African-American, words such as thug, cheap shot artist, sore loser, and animal don't apply to a guy who catches touchdowns for Tom Brady and didn't grow up on the hood.\"",
