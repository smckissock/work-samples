  "\"I think one of the elements that really brings this season a real richness is how so many of the characters whose stories we've been following are coming together and we're weaving their stories into one,\" Flynn said.",
  "We asked Flynn about his character getting the chance to mess with Podrick again on the sixth season, when they both met in the Lannister camp at Riverrun and Bronn had fun play fighting with the once-young squire.",
  "The seventh season of \"Game of Thrones\" has been all about reunions - from the emotional Stark children finally walking through Winterfell together to Daenerys' warm embrace of Ser Jorah Mormont.",
  "Read our full interview with Jerome Flynn to learn more about Bronn's secret heroic side and the humorous last name Flynn has given him since the show hasn't done so already.",
  "Jerome Flynn plays Bronn on the HBO series and he told INSIDER that we might get a more lighthearted reunion down the road between Tyrion and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",
  "Even though Bronn and Jaime have proven to be a great duo as well, we hope Flynn is right that there's a good chance of Podrick and Tyrion getting their reunion, too.",
  "\"Down the road, I believe we'll get a nice bit of Tyrion and Bronn doing their thing and shootin' the breeze as they do and some of that old dynamic comes back.\"",
  "Fans might have been caught off guard when Bronn brought Jaime to his brother Tyrion in order to help broker a potential armistice in \"Eastwatch.\"",
  "\"And I think there was a [reunion] scene [on last week's episode] originally but for whatever reason they decided that preempted things.\"",
  "Some fans have been wistfully thinking of the shenanigans Tyrion got up to with Podrick and Bronn in King's Landing.",
  "Macall B. Polay/HBO\n\n\"The surprise element of bringing the brothers together was the payoff,\" Flynn said.",

  "\"And there's a good chance that ... as a threesome I'm hoping they will come together again.\"",
  "Bronn, Podrick, and Tyrion were an unstoppable team on seasons two and three.",
  "\"It's just so good to watch, just as a fan I'm enjoying every minute of it.\"",
  "\"I believe that's gonna happen, yeah,\" Flynn told INSIDER in an interview.",
  "\"That was one of my favorite scenes from last season,\" Flynn said.",
  "Tyrion and Jaime's conversation was a highlight of \"Eastwatch.\"",
  "But what about Podrick?"
