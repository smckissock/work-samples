  "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat and the only declared Democrat candidate for speaker, is reportedly having issues securing a majority of 218 votes in the new Congress that will be seated next year.",
  "That is the requisite number of members she needs to publicly cast votes for her on the Floor if she wants to regain the speakerâ€™s gavel in the next Congress now that Democrats have retaken the House majority."
