  "So, one of the things since we’ve been talking about Russia and the Russiagate investigation on The Global Politico—one of the interesting things is that the politics surrounding it, on both right and left, have gotten scrambled, and you have this element of what I would call Muller-denialism that exists on the left as well as the right, people saying basically Russiagate is a distraction; it’s not that serious; we shouldn’t care about it; we should really focus either on the actual threats from Russia or on the problems of President Trump from the point of view of the left don’t have to do with Russia; they have to do with what Trump is doing in the United States.",
  "Glasser: Well, one of the things that you pointed out already that I think really drives a lot of this is that Americans tend to forget that while it’s an authoritarian political system, it’s still a political system, and Vladimir Putin is often responding to his internal need to maintain himself and his government and his regime in power, and there’s another clip from Khodorkovsky where he made that point, where he said, Look, this is Vladimir Putin’s campaign platform, America-bashing.",
  "\"…for a person who is breaking glass and wanting to reshape the world, and thinks that so much about it is wrong, and that the Americans have gotten a bad deal, and the way we’ve done things has been inappropriate -- for him to create a different kind of relationship with Russia, and especially someone who is strong like Putin, I think he views that as something that would show that he has the ability to do things that no other president has been able to do.\"",
  "So, it is about Trump, but I think the media and Democrats have—and I hate to lump them together—but, I think they have kind of failed to make the debate not about Trump, but about national security, about the integrity of our elections, about the fact that they’ll do this to anybody, they’ll do this to Republicans, too, if they find that they’re being too hawkish on Russia, or if they want to just stir up more chaos.",
  "When I had Victoria Nuland on this show, she talked about the “Spidey sense” of the Russia experts inside the U.S. government, and how the hairs on the back of their necks were standing up when they started to realize in 2016 that Russia was running the same play inside the United States that it had run in many Eastern European countries already, intervening in their politics, and yet we didn’t seem to recognize it.",
  "And it’s funny to see this country described as this kind of Bondian nexus of evil where everything is super-organized, Putin is this master strategist who just has everything planned out from A to Z, and is able to follow through piece by piece on his strategy or on his agenda, and that everything is just—I mean, it’s basically the Soviet Union mixed with The Americans mixed with some James Bond.",
  "But the belated rebuke of Putin was short and cryptic enough that it seemed to underscore the strange mystery of why Trump, while allowing his government to pursue an increasingly confrontational series of policies aimed at countering Russia, has never publicly disavowed his oft-stated admiration for the strongman leader who ordered his spies to intervene in the U.S. election on Trump’s behalf.",
  "Ioffe: And if you don’t have—I’ve been joking with some journalist friends that if I had a superpower I’d want subpoena power, because otherwise it’s really impossible to follow the money these days, and I think that’s one of the avenues that is going to become more kind of fleshed out and filled in as the Mueller investigation continues, I hope, because I think there’s going to be a lot there.",
  "And yet, throughout that, the consistency with which we have talked about Russia—not only, of course, because I was a former correspondent in Moscow—but because it has been a theme in many ways, both of the politics of the Trump administration, with the Russiagate investigation still underway, but also because it has remained the most perplexing foreign policy question.",
  "We just become—because we’re prone to it the same way the Russians are prone to it—we’re a big country with imperial ambitions and this kind of imperialness in our DNA the way that Russians are, and it’s very easy for us to turn inward and become obsessed with our own internal struggles, and not notice that the Russian thief is out back cleaning out your chicken coop.",
  "They were trying all kinds of different things, and I think this is what we also—just going back to what we don’t understand about the Russians—we think of it as because the way we Americans would do it, we would have a clear hierarchy, a clear plan; there would be, kind of everybody would be unified in their mission and their idea of what everybody’s doing.",
  "Ioffe: Well, this has been a thing that Vladimir Putin has been remarkably consistent about, and in 2007, when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference, he said that basically the liberal order that was established in 1991 at the end of the Cold War is over, and we don’t agree to it, and we want to rediscuss and renegotiate the terms of surrender.",
  "And, again, I think as you and I have talked about a lot, it’s a lot about how we imagine our adversary as Americans; and for somebody to be able to come in and mess with our elections, or to stymie us in geopolitics and take over our traditional kind of—I hate to use this term—spheres of influence, they have to be a really mighty enemy, right?",
  "Tweet or no tweet, as Trump now contemplates a retaliatory strike on Putin’s Syrian partner, it’s more clear than ever that Russia remains the signal foreign policy dilemma of the Trump presidency – the issue on which the president has split, repeatedly, with top advisers like his now-booted secretary of state and national security adviser.",
  "Donald Trump to this day has never personally moved beyond his public admiration for Vladimir Putin, his praise for him, and yet his administration has talked tough, has really undertaken a policy toward Russia that isn’t all that different from what a Democratic or a Republican administration might do, faced with the same set of facts.",
  "You’re really attributing to our leadership, to the Kremlin, to Putin, whatever, much greater power than we think they have.”… So there’s a real puzzlement there about the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.",
  "And we will even sell you and help guide you to have the most effective use of this tool, and you will be able to—\n\nIoffe: And planting you—\n\nNot only that, but we’re going to tell you exactly what these Americans like; what they think about; who their friends are; and what kind of messages would most appeal to them.",
  "My basic takeaway is that the terminology isn’t all that helpful because the first Cold War was plenty bad, and it existed in a totally different both media and information and military context, where there could be clear dividing lines between Russia and the West in a way that the current world is no longer so neat.",
  "So, the issue is, do we really buy and accept this notion that, rather than America as the one superpower going forward, we have entered the post-American age, the age when we will struggle—not that we won’t be a power, but that when we will struggle and compete with other powers like China and Russia for dominance?",
  "And I worry that they’re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that’s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage.”\n\nIn a confrontation, she argues, Putin may well prove a smarter actor on the world stage than the American president who had started out hoping to be friends.",
  "As we now know from some terrific reporting from Russian reporters—what’s left of them—and the fact that actually the Russians’ strength was in their disorganization, in their flexibility, in their high appetite for risk, and the fact that they were willing to try crazy things and pivot as the situation merited.",
  "Ioffe: I mean, and I think it’s helpful to—getting back to your very first question about the often ignorant way in which Russia is discussed in Washington—I think it’s not just about pride of intellect and expertise; it’s about accurately diagnosing the problem and knowing what it is you’re dealing with, right?",
  "You and I are talking on a day when there are a whole wave of new sanctions that have been finally released that target Putin’s inner circle in response to this, but for God’s sakes, we’re talking about this is the spring of 2018, and this intervention occurred starting in late 2014, according to Bob Mueller.",
  "Or, because of the internet, in addition to, like if you went back to 1983 and talked to KGB agent Vladimir Putin, and you’re like, on top of this tool they’re going to call Facebook, they’re also going to invent this thing called the internet, and they’re going to put all their political information on line.",
  "And then, when he returned to power in 2012, widely seen as an illegitimate return to power for his third term as president, he took on a more ideological, more revanchist kind of approach, and it became about, the economy’s not doing great, but that’s okay, because we’re an empire again; we’re great again.",
  "…\n\n“A lot of us had this Spidey sense and concerns all through ’16 that the Russians were playing by a new playbook now, but we did not truly understand the totality of the effort…’\n\nMichael Morell: “It’s a failure of imagination that’s not dissimilar to the failure of imagination that we had for 9/11.",
  "And as we’re realizing also, with all the disclosures about Cambridge Analytica and the role that Facebook played, and earlier, the revelations about the role that Twitter played, and just the role of political advertising—we’re realizing that in some ways the Russians played the role of terrorists.",
  "All of these state visits are very important to them; the optics are very important to them, especially for Vladimir Putin, who wants to make Russia great again, who wants Russia to be seen as a peer to the U. S., and not as a junior partner in the relationship that is to be punished for things.",
  "What better image is there for him, after all of these diplomatic expulsions, after all of these sanctions, after—again—a poisoning on U.K. territory with a crazy nerve agent—that he gets a photo op with the president of the U.S., in the White House that the president of the U.S. invited him to?",
  "And they lump Russia together with China and basically say the age of counterterrorism, post-9/11 obsession is over, and we have to return and renew a focus as a country on the challenges that count from great powers Russia and China, that we’re in a new era of competition with Russia and China.",
  "I remember in 2012-2013 when the Russian economy started its kind of long decline, Russians who were very smart watching what was happening and very in tune with what has happening politically were saying, as Russia gets poorer internally, it’s going to become more aggressive externally.",
  "Glasser: My guest this week on The Global Politico is Julia Ioffe, as well as all of you listeners who have been wonderful and kind and smart and really offered a lot of great insights and feedback over the course of the last year, as we have taken The Global Politico on the road.",
  "And this has been kind of bandied about on political talk shows here, about whether or not basically Donald Trump was essentially a laundromat for dirty Russian money because he didn’t ask too many questions, and needed the money because American banks wouldn’t lend to him.",
  "Glasser: And by the way, just this week, I should point out, you have this incredible visual image of Donald Trump saying on the one hand, “I want to get out of Syria immediately, as soon as possible,” never mind what his advisers said or what the American policy has been.",
  "So, I was there in Moscow for the first four years, basically, of Putin’s presidency, when he certainly didn’t have the international capabilities that he has now to basically intervene in the war in Syria, to intervene and to create a civil war on the ground in Ukraine.",
  "Ioffe: This was the call that Trump made to Putin after his—quote/unquote—election on March 18th, where he squeaked by with a nail-biting 77 percent of the vote, and it, again, came after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent.",
  "Last summer, when Congress passed—this completely broken Congress passed with a veto-proof majority a mandate for new Russia sanctions, and Trump made several public statements about it saying he doesn’t like this bill; he doesn’t want to do sanctions against Russia.",
  "And that was a cost.”\n\n\n\nThis, of course, from the very beginning of this Global Politico podcast has been a subject of ongoing and recurring conversations, both because it radically affects how Vladimir Putin is seen in the United States—how does he want to be seen?",
  "At the height of the Cold War, imagine that you told KGB agent Vladimir Putin or any of his bosses, “America itself is going to invent a tool by which you can have direct access to basically every single American—certainly, every single American you’d like to reach.",
  "I mean, all Russian politicians up and down the power vertical, all of Russian TV, was crowing about how the president of the U.S. wants to be friends, but the deep state is hamstringing him, and is just pointlessly against Russia, just irrationally against Russia.",
  "But, given how—and this was one of the first ways that contemporary Russians took advantage of the American political system is, they make their money at home and then get it out of the country into the West, using all the things we invented almost for them.",
  "Glasser: Well, there’s also this striking—call it a bifurcation, a split screen situation that’s developed, where it’s been one of the most revealing aspects of the gap between Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s administration when it comes to foreign policy.",
  "And all of them, to a man and woman, said, “We can’t understand why you Americans are so obsessed with what Russia may or may not have done.” They said, “You’ve now made us into this colossus, as if we kind of control what’s happening in the United States.",
  "Glasser: Well, this is a great starting point, actually, for our first segment of our conversation today, which is about the Russia as it actually is, and what do we really think about Vladimir Putin now that he has just gotten another six-year term?",
  "And usually, the answer is not Russia, but we’re talking about ourselves in the same way that when Russians obsess about America; they’re not really obsessing about America, they’re obsessing about themselves but refracted through this external lens.",
  "And that he—the last thing he does—it turns out that it’s the last thing he does, is he says—basically, he calls out Russia for the poisoning of this former Russian spy in the U.K., and then is unceremoniously dumped by President Trump the next day.",
  "And so what I’m struck by is that Americans—even if you put aside this question of Donald Trump—they’re not really prepared for that kind of a confrontation, and right now, of course, you don’t really have a president who is leading or shaping that.",
  "And I’m just getting goosebumps thinking about it all over again, because it’s just…\n\nIf you’re a Russiagate skeptic, which I definitely was at the beginning, it’s like there’s increasingly less room for skepticism, because how do you explain that?",
  "And it’s about this bait-and-switch of—you know, Putin’s original contract with the Russian people was, you guys get wealthy or you become better off; I’ll help you do that, but you in return, you stay out of politics, and you leave that to me.",
  "We covered everything from why she thinks Russia is just as much Arrested Development as it is The Americans, to what Washington consistently gets wrong about it, to why Putin has been so successful at playing four straight American presidents.",
  "When we started out at The Global Politico, we would have been astonished to know a lot of the information that has subsequently come out about contacts between the Trump campaign and various Russian envoys, emissaries, spies, and the like.",
  "You don’t even have to go there and flip sources, you know—all this information about what districts to target, about what states are up in air, what issues are driving the conversation and are really pitting Americans against each other.",
  "But it still hasn’t fundamentally yet answered the question of to what extent U.S. persons, and specifically those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself—did they know about this, and were they involved in it?",
  "Ioffe: Yes, no more unipolar world, where America calls all the shots with no friction, because we’ve seen—I mean, this was happening in 2007, again, four years after the invasion of Iraq and six years after the invasion of Afghanistan.",
  "If we agree, as it seems that we do, that Trump has never wavered in either his admiration for Putin or desire somehow to reset relations, even though politically that’s become very unrealistic, where does that leave the two countries?",
  "Vladimir Putin was, in fact, very horrible to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Vladimir Putin is horrible in a lot of ways, but here if you read the discussion or you listen to the discussion about Russia, you’re not hearing about those ways.",
  "One of the things—right, Julia—that from the beginning has been so weird about Trump and Russia is that on one hand, Washington has never been more obsessed with Russia in some ways, and yet, it’s very ignorant about Russia, too.",
  "You know, he’s basically given them a big opening to walk right into, and they’re very ably playing the administration off the president that heads it to their own advantage, because the Russians, like the Chinese, love protocol.",
  "Ioffe: And, as some people have pointed out, by the time these sanctions came out, mostly against oligarchs, they have had plenty of time to restructure their assets in a way where they’ll be minimally affected by the sanctions.",
  "Because we’re talking about Russia right now, but an awful lot of what passes for Russia conversation in Washington today, in American politics, is really not about Russia; it’s about Russiagate, or whatever you want to call it.",
  "We launched The Global Politico within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration last year, in 2017, and the idea was really to help make sense of this disrupted world, and what kind of a foreign policy was Donald Trump going to have.",
  "I think that the debate around it has gotten so politicized and if you’re in one camp you have to say and believe the following things, and if you’re in the other you have to say and believe another set of facts, or beliefs.",
  "And I think we have to understand that Russia is going to continue throwing sand in the gears, or weightier objects, and that they’re going to be a force that is constantly going to push back—often just to push back.",
  "Glasser: And that’s because it really brings us right back to the modern version of Kremlinology, which is, what’s inside the head of Vladimir Putin, what’s inside the head of Donald Trump at this key moment in time.",
  "We would be amazed to have learned, for example, about that summer 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Russians were openly promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to President Trump’s own son and his top campaign officials.",
  "And there was a story you and I talked about that came out last month on a weekend, pretty unnoticed, the Reuters investigation that rich Russians bought about $100 million of Trump property in south Florida alone.",
  "I think it’s very notable that he spoke out publicly later and basically not only he confirmed it by saying, “Well, yeah, shouldn’t we get along with Russia?” which is what he’s been saying ever since the campaign.",
  "Just a few days ago, Trump spoke once again, if a bit plaintively, about his desire to get along with Putin even as his administration was putting out a tough new round of sanctions hitting Putin’s inner circle.",
  "I mean, I think it’s really telling that much of the Russian news today is not really about what’s happening in Russia, not about a stagnant economy, not about corruption, not about rotten infrastructure.",
  "But the thing that I remember so vividly that’s relevant to today’s conversation was that at the beginning Putin really was about restoring the Russian state internally, rebuilding power in the Kremlin.",
  "I talked Russia, Russia, Russia for this week’s Global Politico with the journalist Julia Ioffe, a Russia-born reporter who is one of the few to have covered both Putin’s Moscow and Trump’s Washington.",
  "Glasser: Right, well, combined with the still unknown questions of how much help they received in targeting and distributing this information, either by the Trump campaign or those associated with it.",
  "There’s been this long debate that actually predates Donald Trump, but has certainly flared up anew since the election, over whether or not we are in a state of essentially a new Cold War with Russia.",
  "Ioffe: The reason I’m scared is because, like I said, I think in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just—the way things were done.",
  "So, as we were trying to protect the country from terrorists, we became more blind to what was going on in the rest of the world, both from a collection perspective and from an analytic perspective.",
  "Glasser: And they did it to make it clear to people like us who are paying attention that Donald Trump is not on the same page with the tough policies coming out of his administration, number one.",
  "And Corker said, “You know, I have to say—I’m sorry to say it—I do think that it’s a degree of admiration for a strongman,” and that that is part of Trump’s enduring admiration for Vladimir Putin.",
  "He lost the popular vote by a massive amount of votes and then squeaked through in these areas that were completely unexpected—you know, they were the blue Democratic wall in the upper Midwest.",
  "It’s about the Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S. elections, the ongoing investigations of it by the Senate Intelligence Committee and, in particular, by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.",
  "I mean, this to me was just—\n\nRecipient of the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin himself, who with his own hands pinned that thing on Tillerson’s lapel, that medal on Tillerson’s lapel.",
  "Glasser: So I picked out a few of our interviews over the last year on The Global Politico that really go to this question of, are we really talking about Russia as it actually exists today?",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nIt took a chemical weapons attack in Syria by Putin’s ally (“Animal Assad,” in Trumpian twitter-speak) and gruesome pictures of dead children to prompt the criticism.",
  "I think what we still don’t know—to me, this is the most interesting question, and also the question that probably is completely unanswerable, is what impact did it have on the election?",
  "“And this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he’s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist.",
  "Anne Applebaum: \"it puts us in an odd position, where it’s almost as if the Cold War is back, except only one side is fighting it.”\n\nAnd what is with his admiration for Vladimir Putin?",
  "Many of his advisers did, but Barack Obama demeaned and belittled Russia and basically dismissed them as insignificant in the sweep of history, a finished and doomed former superpower.",
  "And this is kind of the built-in advantage of an autocratic system, where Putin already knows how to do all this, and he’s kind of a better tactician, and kind of a better strategist.",
  "Or that he does these things—again, you and I have talked about this a lot, about this split between the Trump administration, which says, do not congratulate when you talk to Putin.",
  "And I think that’s sort of our third and final aspect of our conversation today, because you can’t really talk about Russia and Trump without talking about what is inside his mind.",
  "She said, Well, we actually have a clearer sense at this point in time of what Russia’s intentions are than we do of what Washington and what Donald Trump is going to do about it.",
  "Glasser: So, I think this notion of Vladimir Putin exactly as he wants to be seen is a great pivot to how he is seen in the United States today, and this Russiagate investigation.",
  "But even if you don’t like the terminology, as I know—clearly, the situation between the two countries is as hostile, if not more so, than at any period since the late Cold War.",
  "Number two, that Donald Trump continues almost to this day to be privately acting in a very conciliatory fashion towards Vladimir Putin, and in fact, even seeking his approval.",
  "So, my question to you is, going forward, do you believe that now that Putin has another six-year term under his belt, is he going to be more aggressive again, internationally?",
  "Ioffe: I mean, I’ve spoken to former NSA head Michael Hayden about this, and he said, “You know, the best covert operations they don’t create facts or divisions on the ground.",
  "“The reason I’m scared is because… in the Cold War there were kind of protocols and rules developed and lines of communication, and there were just—the way things were done.",
  "Glasser: But I have to say, first of all, I need to make a little announcement of my own, because it will help to explain what this episode of The Global Politico is about.",
  "Glasser: Even if the meeting never occurs, the timing of the leak, coming from the Russians, was very clearly weaponizing information that Trump himself had handed them.",
  "Still, I think it’s quite a strong signal, and I think the kind of underexplored and under-noticed area that I think a lot of this will come down to is the money aspect.",
  "So, somebody who is really good with all the tools in that toolbox, that he can go to war if necessary and push back, but he is primarily the only adult in the room.",
  "Like, all of our fears of intervention in Syria, Russia has shown that you can do quite effectively with very few men on the ground and very little money, actually.",
  "We’ve always returned to Russia, and Russiagate over and over and over again, which is why we have this final Russia, Russia, Russia episode of The Global Politico.",
  "And of course there’s the matter of that Russian election intervention – and the still ongoing investigations of whether Trump or his campaign team knew about it.",
  "Otherwise are we not very good if we’re stymied by some kind of tin-pot dictator, banana republic, where things are kind of held together with shoelaces and gum?",
  "And I’ll leave the final word, actually, to another friend of ours, Anne Applebaum, in a conversation that she and I had a few months ago on The Global Politico.",
  "He has been similarly kind to President Xi of China, Duterte of the Philippines, Erdogan of Turkey; he thinks that that’s a good way to run a country, you know.",
  "And it’s amazing how much it really resonates with Russians, how much it’s important to them, the same way it’s important to Americans to live in a great power.",
  "And American society will be so divided and fraught at the time that it’ll be a total cakewalk to divide them further and to fan kind of the flames of division.",
  "He called it this “myth of the great and horrible Putin.”\n\nIoffe: Which is so interesting because he lost a decade of his life to this horrible Vladimir Putin.",
  "In an early morning tweet exactly one year and 77 days into his presidency, Donald Trump on Sunday finally criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.",
  "I think the level of disbelief was also driven in fact by—well, we’re not Germany and we’re not France and we’re certainly not Hungary—this can’t happen here.",
  "He’s not going to start crazy, stupid wars like the Americans did in Iraq, which is constantly brought up by the Russians, when they admonished the Americans.",
  "And we have something to say about that, too, and we will push back in a very real way.”\n\nGlasser: So, welcome to the future…\n\nIoffe: He’s achieved it, yes.",
  "I also worry that Putin—you know, this isn’t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs.",
  "And I worry that they’re both going to start clawing their way out of their respective corners and that that’s going to lead to a lot of collateral damage.",
  "“Imagine if we were fighting the Cold War all over again, except only one side was fighting it.” And I think that’s an important question to leave us with.",
  "First though, we’re going to have a quick break, and we’ll be right back with more of my conversation with Julia Ioffe right after a word from our sponsor.",
  "Angela Stent: I was in Russia a few months ago talking to Russians, both those who I would say are more supportive of the government and those who aren’t.",
  "And that, of course, is what still remains up in the air, and your point—\n\nIoffe: But also, the other thing is that that’s also hard to determine, right?",
  "Ioffe: As someone pointed out to me the other day, he is literally meaner to Meryl Streep than he is to Vladimir Putin, which is really quite something.",
  "His last words out the door this week were a warning that the United States had failed to, in his view, adequately respond to the Russian provocations.",
  "We all knew that it would be different than what came before, and every week it’s been sort of variations on a theme of just how different has it been.",
  "… Now … you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful.",
  "As promised, Julia and I are going to talk Trump, because you can’t talk about Russia and the United States today without talking about Donald Trump.",
  "And you have two guys, Trump and Putin, who are both painted into a corner, strategically, both at home and geopolitically, who are very prideful.",
  "“You know, this isn’t his first rodeo, and this is not his first U.S. president, whereas Trump is still kind of getting his sea legs,” Ioffe says.",
  "And I worry that in this showdown Putin’s going to outmaneuver Trump and the U.S.”\n\nYou can read our full discussion below, or listen to it here.",
  "And it was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Russian wealthiest man—he was then imprisoned by Vladimir Putin—now a dissident who lives in London.",
  "Then you have Syria; you have the meddling in elections all over Europe and in the U.S., most recently being the Catalan independence movement.",
  "It may go on a bit of a hiatus, but I’m going to make a little bit of a career change, and work full-time at The New Yorker as a staff writer.",
  "So, there’s no referendum issue too small for Putin to get his hands in and try to kind of chip away at the transatlantic alliance, or order.",
  "It was at the very beginning of The Global Politico, we had Bob Corker on the show, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
  "[INDISCERNIBLE 00:41:02]\n\nIoffe: And there were kind of rules and protocols of what you do, especially by the latter phase of the Cold War.",
  "We weren’t sure what had happened in the first 10 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but we were pretty sure we didn’t like it.",
  "At the time he was still talking with Trump a lot and he was desperately trying to get inside his mind and figure out what’s going on.",
  "All of America is watching this race in Alabama, while Russia’s just cleaning up in the Middle East, at very low cost, very low cost.",
  "So, it becomes even more problematic that he won’t say anything about Russia, especially because Russia continues to do crazy things.",
  "No more—you guys can’t just go around doing whatever you want, especially you can’t call the shots on who gets to rule which country.",
  "Even if they did have help from the Trump organization, and it seems that the Trump organization was happy to take help from anybody.",
  "I think what we missed, or that Putin wasn’t yet ready for, was this much more internationally aggressive leader that we have today.",
  "And looking internally, consolidating authority; eliminating the democracy that had taken hold, if tenuously, in the first 10 years.",
  "And I think the problem lies in the fact that it has become about Trump, and Trump and Republicans feel this, and so they push back.",
  "But we’re still talking about the narrow question of the 2016 election and were votes swayed, and in some ways it’s very unknowable.",
  "They feel, maybe correctly, that this is Democrats kind of wanting a do-over, or at the very least, undermining Trump’s legitimacy.",
  "When SNL was mean to him in the very beginning of his administration, he publicly called into question NBC’s broadcasting license.",
  "And arguably, that’s an era that began before Donald Trump; it’s likely to continue after Trump has left office, whenever that is.",
  "You don’t even need spies in Russia; they can just sit in Moscow—\n\nGlasser: Or St. Petersburg, with the Internet Research Agency.",
  "Did people come out and vote more for Trump because they saw these ads saying that Hillary was going to let in all these Muslims?",
  "And it’s also kind of an embodiment of what Vladimir Putin wants to be and how he wants to be seen, both domestically and abroad.",
  "Did people stay home and not vote because they were Bernie supporters, and they were disgusted by what came out in the DNC hack?",
  "You know, for this consistently laudatory rhetoric toward Russia and Putin, and I think we still don’t know the answer to that.",
  "And I worry that in this showdown Putin’s going to outmaneuver Trump and the U.S.\n\nGlasser: Well, you know, it’s interesting.",
  "We used to be helping to run the Geneva talks; now they’ve been moved to Astana in Central Asia, in a former Soviet republic.",
  "So, let’s talk Russiagate for a few minutes, and also what the Obama and Trump administrations did and didn’t do about that.",
  "Arguably, during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev, we were on much better terms as a country during the, say, the George H.W.",
  "And so you have this relatively hawkish foreign policy on Russia that’s more or less supported by Democrats and Republicans.",
  "Glasser: These are the famous talking points that were leaked to the Washington Post and probably sped up the firing of H.R.",
  "And read the New York Times and POLITICO and The Cook Political Report and watch all these TV channels through the internet.",
  "Glasser: We will compete with Russia and China for influence, authority, power and advantage, whether military or economic.",
  "I’m really delighted that our guest this week is my friend and someone who knows Russia much better than I do, Julie Ioffe.",
  "And I think that has very much been borne out since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine.",
  "And also because it was an operation that was, as one former Obama official said, was like throwing spaghetti at the wall.",
  "But in fact, in Russia, one hand didn’t know what the other hand was doing, and there was a lot of turf battles going on.",
  "Is he going to aggressively seek to revise international borders, to challenge the United States and the West elsewhere?",
  "That said, Erdogan, Xi, and Duterte did not intervene in the 2016 election with the overt goal of helping him win—right?",
  "It’s just going to be—you’re just going to have this little screen, and it’s going to be at your fingertips, literally.",
  "You know, LLCs, American law firms buying their property for them that are then protected by attorney-client privilege.",
  "And Putin came in and he played off of those feelings of insecurity and instability on the part of the Russian people.",
  "And I think that’s what Syria’s about; it’s kind of drawing a line and saying, “America cannot say so-and-so must go.",
  "So the conundrum of trying to understand what the heck is going on with Russia has remained this enduring obsession.",
  "And one of which—the invasion of Iraq—Putin was firmly against, and at that point he had been kind of proven right.",
  "And it’s actually very similar to the new national defense strategy penned by Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense.",
  "When you’re in Russia, what you hear about is, did Putin do this for external consumption or internal consumption?",
  "And I think I sometimes overcompensate in the other direction, where I’m like, you guys are just not that good.",
  "So, this will be not our last, but our second-to-last episode of The Global Politico, at least with me as host.",
  "Mikhail Khodorkovsky: Here, in the West, the impression that people have is that Putin runs the whole country.",
  "And unfortunately, yes, it is about Trump, because it was an election in which he won in a really strange way.",
  "We’ll talk about some of those today, some of the highlights, and Julia and I will try to make sense of it.",
  "But The Global Politico in its current iteration, sadly, will only have this episode and the next episode.",
  "He’s now taken over Crimea—that was the first armed annexation of territory since the end of World War II.",
  "It was this kind of perfect storm, and the Russians just were able to push it in just the right direction.",
  "He has attempted kind of a much paler version of what these guys do, of undermining the independent press.",
  "And Trump followed it up, by the way, rather than being ashamed or trying to hide this, what did Trump do?",
  "Before he was thrown out, H. R. McMasters authored a new National Security Strategy for the United States.",
  "It’s so hard to gauge, right, because everybody’s decision to vote is so multifaceted and multifactorial.",
  "Russia is now heading up the peace talks in Syria, bringing both the Turks and the Iranians to the table.",
  "Victoria Nuland: \"It was the hacking…So, that’s when the hairs really went up on the back of our necks.",
  "People were still debating over what kind of identity Putin would bring to the office of the president.",
  "Glasser: Well, and it’s interesting because that was a theme of Vladimir Putin from the very beginning.",
  "And I don’t know about you—you spent a lot of time there, too—I don’t recognize that Russia, you know.",
  "So, Mueller has already issued criminal indictments; there have already been guilty pleas in the case.",
  "I remember watching the Roy Moore election in Alabama, and I just thought, this is so perfect, right?",
  "She’s a contributor to The Atlantic, and she is one of the smartest Russia hands in Washington today.",
  "The Russia I know is a lot more like Arrested Development, mixed with some James Bond stuff, right?",
  "When he’s fighting in Syria; when he’s fighting in Ukraine—he’s fighting against the big bad West.",
  "…\n\n“We moved resources that were focused on the rest of the world, to include places like Russia.",
  "It just—even the optics of it are so bad, that he’s pushed out everybody who’s hawkish on Russia.",
  "And it’s always—\n\nIoffe: We keep finding out—the Russians are—so, this is what I was getting to.",
  "“I’m very scared,” Ioffe tells me of the brewing confrontation between the two blustery leaders.",
  "And I thought, given that, that we really ought to devote the full conversation today to Russia.",
  "In the Middle East, it’s seen now—instead of the U.S., it’s seen as the kind of reliable ally.",
  "And a lot of I think what we don’t understand is that a lot of times the song is not about us.",
  "Ioffe: So, I think—again, this goes back to the idea of who is a worthy adversary to the U.S.",
  "Glasser: You know, I mean, I’m glad you brought that up, because I’ve been so struck by that.",
  "So, that’s where we all sense there is a potential political explosion coming down the road.",
  "The same day, you have this incredible visual of Vladimir Putin convening regional leaders.",
  "And the one question I’ll add to the outstanding questions is Donald Trump’s motivations.",
  "And the note said that the talking point said, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” in capital letters.",
  "They were able to manipulate these openings on these platforms into pretty deft weapons.",
  "It’s a war between Russia and the West; it’s not a war between Russians and Ukrainians.",
  "He can convene all sides and be seen as an honest broker who actually follows through.",
  "Donald Trump has never to this day said something publicly critical of Vladimir Putin.",
  "How much will it directly reach the level—\n\nIoffe: And it already has, as we’ve seen.",
  "They exacerbate the ones that are already there.” And in some ways, 2016 was perfect.",
  "You then returned after you graduated from college as a working journalist to Moscow.",
  "He’s already, in fact, become the longest-serving Russian leader since Josef Stalin.",
  "A lot of times it’s done for an internal audience, to shore up his domestic support.",
  "***\n\nSusan Glasser: Hi, it’s Susan Glasser, and welcome back to The Global Politico.",
  "Number one, which is how much will it directly reach the level of criminal activity?",
  "In fact, people were still debating over, could they repay the Soviet debt in time.",
  "So, we are kind of unusual in that we both have covered both Washington and Moscow.",
  "I think Syria and the Middle East are going to be a very interesting area to watch.",
  "To me, that was almost the visual representation of the post-American world order.",
  "It’s one of those cases where what are we talking about when we talk about Russia?",
  "You know, LLCs that buy LLCs that buy LLCs that buy some property in Trump Tower.",
  "You know, it’s a truism in journalism, and it’s truer than ever—follow the money.",
  "So, thank you, Julia, for being our guest, and thank you to all of you listeners.",
  "Where do you come down on that debate, because it’s a pretty fierce one already?",
  "Ioffe: It’s one of the very few things on which he’s been absolutely consistent.",
  "He wants to be seen as the great diplomat and peacemaker, and also aggressor.",
  "Glasser: Not only that, but he invites him to the White House for a meeting.",
  "He used to call it the vertical of vlast—basically, the vertical of power.",
  "She is an author—she’s writing a book she can tell us about, about Russia.",
  "Which is kind of how—\n\nGlasser: It would have been a KGB officer’s dream.",
  "On much better terms with the Soviet Union than we are with Russia today.",
  "I think he has an abiding fascination with and admiration for strongmen.",
  "…people so easily accept this myth about this great and horrible Putin.",
  "Back in the early 2000s, Russia really was much more of a basket case.",
  "It’s been an ongoing theme ever since we launched The Global Politico.",
  "Susan B. Glasser is POLITICO’s chief international affairs columnist.",
  "Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent.",
  "And we talked with Corker, and he had talked with Trump about Putin.",
  "Both very kind of emotional knee-jerk decision makers, to an extent.",
  "But there is nothing more legitimizing than that, for the Russians.",
  "Bush administration, even during the second Reagan administration.",
  "There’s two other elements of this we haven’t really talked about.",
  "And you have the spectacle of the national security advisor, H.R.",
  "In fact, he invites him to a White House visit—not just a visit.",
  "So that was the story of the four-year period when I was there.",
  "And that’s, I think, part of the brilliance of this operation.",
  "We are challenging the West; we are not dancing to their tune.",
  "But, my goodness, that was back in January, February, of 2017.",
  "Ioffe: Yes, and it has been from the moment it kind of broke.",
  "Bring oligarchs under control; bring the media under control.",
  "What do you make of Washington’s Russia obsession these days?",
  "Glasser: I called that his Make Russia Great Again strategy.",
  "Was it proactive and aggressive enough in responding to it?",
  "I do think there is a degree of admiration for a strongman.",
  "I don’t know where that analogy came from, but there it is.",
  "The talking points say, please scold him for the poisoning.",
  "I mean, how scared should we be by this level of hostility?",
  "Ioffe: Yes, I think that’s a very key thing to understand.",
  "We’ve learned an awful lot in the course of the last year.",
  "Julia, thank you for finally being on The Global Politico.",
  "And the Russians are very ably playing off of this split.",
  "McMaster, before he was unceremoniously dumped by Trump.",
  "Her new podcast, The Global Politico, comes out Mondays.",
  "Subscribe to The Global POLITICO on Apple Podcasts here.",
  "We are not being humiliated by them and told what to do.",
  "It’s about the West, or about Russia’s exploits abroad.",
  "You don’t want to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy.",
  "Glasser: Well, this leads to the bigger-frame question.",
  "So, and meddling in the Catalan independence movement.",
  "Ioffe: Well, personally, I find it deeply frustrating.",
  "And then again, the seriousness of this investigation.",
  "America is not in those conversations at all anymore.",
  "And did the Obama administration handle it correctly?",
  "If you actually look at what Trump himself is saying.",
  "Ioffe: Well, then we find this out from the Russians.",
  "Barack Obama didn’t buy into that either, by the way.",
  "And, on one hand I think Corker is absolutely right.",
  "What is the United States supposed to do about this?",
  "I’ll be contributing to their New Yorker Radio Hour.",
  "Glasser: And then you came back here to Washington.",
  "Bob Corker: \"so he looks at Russia, looks at Putin.",
  "The Russian political media made so much hay of it!",
  "Well, again, it was an identity crisis, basically.",
  "It’s basically going to be so cheap as to be free.",
  "Ioffe: I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes.",
  "They’re getting exactly what they want out of it.",
  "But about the—\n\nGlasser: Why are you very scared?",
  "And this was before he publicly broke with Trump.",
  "Now, you have kind of flimsier systems in place.",
  "They used our system, our own tools, against us.",
  "And then of course, what’s happened since then?",
  "And then there’s this question of: And so what?",
  "Ioffe: It’s not the first time they’ve done it.",
  "The question is, was that the deciding factor?",
  "So we’ve had many great episodes about Russia.",
  "Glasser: Welcome back to The Global Politico.",
  "You know, I’m kind of of two minds about it.",
  "Did he get what he wanted with Donald Trump?",
  "He said things are going to be stable again.",
  "Ioffe: Getting the oligarchs under control.",
  "On the Soviet side and on the Russian side.",
  "Things had spiraled out of control in Iraq.",
  "He looks at the relationship that we have.",
  "Glasser: He’s never changed his rhetoric.",
  "Ioffe: To work for you at Foreign Policy.",
  "That’s not true of all that many people.",
  "He’s already been in power for 18 years.",
  "And everybody has a point of view on it.",
  "Glasser: Yes, so now we’re relitigating.",
  "Why did he intervene in our elections?",
  "That that was actually their strength.",
  "That was quite a fulsome introduction.",
  "Julia Ioffe: Thank you for having me.",
  "They have to be really, really good.",
  "I’ve written a long piece about it.",
  "Ioffe: Personally, I’m very scared.",
  "Glasser: No, that’s exactly right.",
  "Maybe that’s a bit of the problem.",
  "And he said, you know, that’s it.",
  "It’s just not within their power.",
  "So you could never track it back.",
  "So how do you square that circle?",
  "Fulsome is what I was aiming for.",
  "Or all these illegal immigrants.",
  "Ioffe: You’re making me blush.",

  "Here we are in April of 2018.",
  "Then Trump congratulates him.",
  "Glasser: Well, that’s right.",
  "Follow her on Twitter @sbg1.",
  "Very similar to those guys.",
  "So, let’s talk about Trump.",
  "They’re not that competent.",
  "Russia talks to all sides.",
  "Glasser: Well, all right.",
  "So, how do you view that?",
  "Ioffe: Or Rex Tillerson.",
  "Ioffe: Thank you, Susan.",
  "You were born in Russia.",
  "This is not so, at all.",
  "He congratulates Putin.",
  "There are fewer rules.",
  "He doesn’t scold him.",

  "And, in fact, it did.",
  "Glasser: Absolutely.",
  "Ioffe: That’s right.",
