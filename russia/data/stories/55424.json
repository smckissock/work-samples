  "Washington (CNN) Somewhere in the halls of the J. Edgar Hoover building in Washington, a closely held number of FBI agents face the daunting task of determining how the Russian government sought to manipulate the US presidential election.",
  "It's a shadowy world that's closed off even to those typically in the know in bureau headquarters, a silo of secrecy in which agents are valued as much for their ability to keep quiet as they are for their investigative skills.",
  "The resources assigned to the Clinton investigation were in response to agents having to sort through a vast amount of electronic data in a finite period of time before the then-looming presidential election, the source said.",
  "In the Russia investigation, for instance, there's been abundant speculation about the significance of meetings between people connected to President Donald Trump and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.",
  "One former supervisor said agents need the seemingly disparate skill set of being good talkers who can recruit and maintain sources while also being able to keep their mouths shut -- about everything.",

  "There was an exception in 2015, when the Counterintelligence Division was publicly credited with the disruption of a Russian spy ring operating in New York City.",
  "One source familiar with the Russia investigation resorted to a mathematical equation to divulge -- sort of -- the number of agents assigned to the matter.",
  "He said counterintelligence work would not appeal to someone with the stereotypical macho cop persona or someone who wants to be the center of attention.",
  "Add to that the freshly assigned task of determining how a huge cache of what appear to be authentic CIA documents ended up on the WikiLeaks website.",
  "Ironically, the division's most enduring publicity came in the wake of the massive betrayal of one of its longtime agents: Robert Philip Hanssen.",
  "\"Their actions represent counterintelligence at its very best and under the most difficult and sensitive of circumstances,\" Freeh said.",

  "Hanssen was arrested in 2001 and charged with selling secrets to the former Soviet Union and Russia over the course of two decades.",
  "\"Hanssen's colleagues and coworkers at the FBI conducted this investigation and did so quietly, securely and without hesitation.",
  "One reason for the long, drawn-out investigations is that their cases rarely are as cut and dried as bank robbery or kidnapping.",
  "With the Russia probe, there is no such time pressure and efforts are more focused on interviews with human sources.",
  "The smaller number of agents assigned to the case should not be interpreted as a lack of interest, the source said.",
  "A meeting in itself means nothing, said Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and Republican congressman from Michigan.",

  "\"First of all, they have to find a crime,\" Rogers, a CNN national security commentator, said of the agents.",
  "Welcome to the super-secret world of the Counterintelligence Division, home to the spy catchers of the FBI.",

  "The man, Evgeny Buryakov, also happened to be an agent of Russia's SVR, their equivalent of the CIA.",
  "CD is so secretive that even former agents are reluctant to speak publicly about their tenure there.",
  "It was a spy-novel-worthy case involving electronic intercepts, surveillance and coded messages.",
  "It was lead by a man working in a Russian bank in Manhattan, according to federal authorities.",
  "Developments in the case are sent up the chain to the highest levels on a regular basis.",
  "\"Ninety-five percent of the cases are classified information or above,\" the source said.",
  "It's a case that's been the subject of endless speculation in Washington and beyond.",
  "Buryakov pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to two and half years in prison.",
  "\"You have to be very disciplined about what you share with whom,\" he said.",
  "\"They keep that (stuff) locked down tight,\" one veteran FBI agent said.",
  "\"It's very different than kicking down doors or doing drug raids.\"",
  "\"I have met with Kislyak twice, as a congressman,\" Rogers said.",

  "You don't want to be noticed,\" the source said.",
  "She did not really know what I did.\"",
