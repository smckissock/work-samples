  "FIRM BEHIND ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER ALSO WORKED FOR RUSSIA, SENATE WITNESS SAYS\n\nAfter the hearing, Fusion GPS responded to Browder’s allegations -- saying they had “complied with the law” and were “not required to register under FARA,” and “did not spread false information about William Browder or Sergei Magnitsky.”\n\n“What is clear is that the president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump’s ties to Russia,” Fusion GPS said in a statement to Fox News last month.",
  "Browder told lawmakers that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in June 2016, also was responsible for hiring Simpson to “conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of a congressional hearing on the Global Magnitsky Act.” The Magnitsky Act is a U.S. law that brings sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.",
