  "At no time did we ever have Ricin A Chain and at no time did we ever repackage RCA60 and sell it as Ricin A Chain.”\n\nBina said that when he left the company in 2010 for a few years, the ricin products were still being correctly identified as “RCA60.” When he returned, Bina said the multiple lots of ricin produced while he was away “were still all correctly identified as ‘RCA60’ on all shipping and manufacturing documents.”\n\nAfter USA TODAY asked FEMA to produce documents showing how the ricin products it received were labeled, the agency called for the inspector general investigation.",

  "Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert at Rutgers University, said what happened at the FEMA training facility with ricin is the latest incident in which “incompetence by a federal agency” has resulted in a mix-up between biological specimens that were thought to be killed or inactivated – yet weren’t.",
  "But he said that a review of the company’s available sales and shipping records show the information sent with the products correctly showed they were “Ricin RCA60.”\n\nAlthough ricin is a select agent, under federal regulations, it’s exempt from regulation if it is held in amounts less than 100 mg.",
  "The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Center for Domestic Preparedness blames an outside laboratory for a series of shipping errors since 2011 that resulted in the first-responder training center using in its classes a potentially lethal form of ricin powder.",
  "(Photo: FEMA)\n\nBecause of yet another mix-up with bioterror pathogens, a federal terrorism response training center in Alabama says it mistakenly exposed more than 9,600 firefighters, paramedics and other students to a deadly toxin over the past five years.",
  "But officials from Toxin Technology, the Florida company that sent nine shipments to the center since 2011, told USA TODAY that its ricin products were all accurately labeled as “RCA60” – a scientific name for the whole ricin toxin, which can be deadly.",

  "After issuing repeated statements to USA TODAY since Monday solely blaming the vendor, on Thursday FEMA administrator W. Craig Fugate called for the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General to investigate.",
  "FEMA officials say their intent was to use the A-chain ricin in its programs because it was safer and would still react with detection equipment during training classes as if it were the more dangerous whole ricin toxin.",
  "Hundreds of government, military, private and university laboratories nationwide possess potential bioterror pathogens, which the government calls “select agents,” such as those that cause anthrax, botulism and plague.",
  "Raoul Reiser, who founded Toxin Technology in 1984 and sold it to a partner about three years ago, told USA TODAY that he remembers supplying A-chain ricin products to the FEMA training facility while he was there.",
  "Bina, who is currently listed on Toxin Technology’s website as vice president and lab manager, said he doesn’t know why Reiser would have been under the impression the product sold by the company was A-chain ricin.",
  "“That makes no sense,” said Ridge, who has been co-chairing a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense that issued a report calling for strengthening U.S. readiness for bioterrorism and response to emerging disease.",
  "A USA TODAY investigation in 2015 found hundreds of safety incidents at labs nationwide and a lax and secretive system of oversight of potential bioterror pathogens that hides serious incidents from the public.",
  "Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said he’s stunned that over the past five years the training center never verified that it was receiving the less-toxic ricin product it thought it was ordering.",
  "Reiser said that while the A-chain ricin product wasn’t in Toxin Technology’s catalog, it was purchased by many customers as far away as Singapore who learned about it through word of mouth.",
  "In 2015, the Pentagon discovered that an Army lab in Utah had been mistakenly shipping live anthrax – labeled as killed – to dozens of labs in the U.S. and abroad for more than a decade.",
  "But he told USA TODAY on Thursday that the company is in the process of contacting all recipients of its ricin products to ensure they are aware they received the whole toxin products.",
  "Neither the CDC nor FEMA would name the vendor that supplied the ricin to the training facility when asked by The Anniston Star, which first revealed the incident, nor to USA TODAY.",
  "“These kinds of things are continually going to happen until biosafety gets elevated to a major level,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security.",
  "Yet officials at Vector Laboratories told USA TODAY their records show they never sold A-chain ricin to Toxin Technology – only a product that contained the whole ricin toxin.",
  "In 2014, CDC mistakes with anthrax specimens that were believed to be killed resulted in dozens of the agency’s lab workers being potentially exposed to the deadly bacteria.",
  "Still Ridge and other national security experts say the ricin mix-up is just the latest high-profile incident showing lax safety practices at U.S. biodefense facilities.",
  "Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nFEMA's Center for Domestic Preparedness Anniston, Ala., was the location of exposure of emergency worker trainees to deadly ricin.",
  "He said Toxin Technology would buy the A-chain ricin in liquid form from the international biological supply company, then turn it into a powdered form for resale.",
  "They’re used in scientific research and the development of vaccines, medical treatments and for creating and testing detection and personal protection equipment.",
  "So while Toxin Technology is regulated by the select agent program, the FEMA training center – which never possessed more than 70 mg of ricin – is not.",
