  "“More than half of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information,” Hill reporter John Solomon writes, based on his conversations with unnamed officials who claim to have knowledge of the documents.",
  "Trump tweeted that the goal was to put a halt to all election hacking and also guard against “many other negative things.” The Best Analogy Award for this development goes to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL):\n\nPartnering with Putin on a \"Cyber Security Unit\" is akin to partnering with Assad on a \"Chemical Weapons Unit\".",
  "Once that became known, she switched gears and began discussing other issues: the adoption of Russian children and the Magnitsky Act, a US law that aims to curb human rights violations in Russia by prohibiting access to the United States and its banking system for individuals who commit those kinds of crimes.",
  "Report accuses material James Comey leaked to a friend contained top secret information pic.twitter.com/Hkg4cAb6o9 — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 10, 2017\n\nThe problem, as the Washington Post details, is that the specific memo was one of seven — and it did not have classified information in it.",
  "“We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up,” he said this past Saturday.",
  "The New York Times reports that on June 9, 2016 — two weeks after Donald Trump clinched the GOP nomination — Natalia Veselnitskaya sat down with Trump Jr., then-campaign chair Paul Manafort, and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is now a top White House aide.",
  "President Donald Trump left the country hoping to put the Russia scandal behind him for a few days, but his actions there — and explosive new revelations here at home about possible collusion with Moscow — meant he returned to an even bigger political firestorm.",
  "The president of the United States thought it was a good idea to work with Russia — the country that US intelligence agencies assess purposely meddled in the election to help him — to set up a new “Cyber Security Unit” to prevent campaign meddling.",
  "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the agreement was “pretty close” to the “dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.” My Vox colleague Yochi Dreazen noted that Graham also blasted Trump for his continued refusal to acknowledge the Russian hacking campaign.",
  "And just this morning, Trump tweeted a baseless accusation that James Comey — the former FBI director whom the president fired because of his role in the Russia investigation — broke the law by leaking classified information to the press.",
  "In yet another tweet, Trump said the former FBI director “leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media,” asserting that it was “so illegal.” That’s a very serious charge, which appears to be based on misleading — bordering on fake — news.",
  "The first was news that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and a campaign surrogate, met with a Russian lawyer with connections to the Kremlin during the campaign in hopes of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.",
  "After all, Comey’s June testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee was well-regarded, making him seem more credible in the public eye than Trump, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll.",
  "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday said the meeting provides no evidence of collusion, stating \"no information was received that was meaningful or helpful and no action was taken.\"",
  "Still, the fact that a Trump family member didn’t mind getting helpful information on Clinton from a Russian only underscores the administration’s general willingness to work with Moscow.",
  "“It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting,” Trump Jr. told the Times.",
  "The right-leaning news channel then aired a segment based on that report, claiming that classified information was in the memo Comey asked a friend to read to the press.",
  "Last night, he tried to distance himself from the news:\n\nThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen.",
  "https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017\n\nNo inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions.",
  "By the way, it is completely possible that this lawyer was not directed by the Kremlin to push Putin’s agenda in this meeting, even if it appears sketchy.",
  "It’s yet another example of a president who criticizes is own intelligence agencies but doesn’t critically watch news segments that are helpful to him.",
  "Recall that there is currently an FBI investigation into whether or not members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to win the election.",
  "The second came at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where Trump agreed to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop election hacking.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian in hopes of harming Hillary Clinton\n\nThis was a bad weekend for the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nEven so, this was an accord the two leaders discussed during their high-profile G20 meeting.",
  "“He is literally the only person I know of who doesn’t believe Russia attacked our election in 2016,” Graham said on NBC’s Meet the Press.",
  "Compare that with what he said on Sunday, where he admitted the sit-down only happened because of how it might have helped the campaign.",
  "Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.",
  "As should probably go without saying at this point, Trump made the charge after seeing an equally baseless report on Fox & Friends.",
  "It goes to show the level of Russia trust in the administration — even on an issue where Russia has proven itself untrustworthy.",
  "Perhaps the president isn’t busy enough to stay off Twitter — but his PR cleanup crew will need to be in the days to come.",
  "Per Comey, four of the memos did have sensitive stuff in them, but they were not handed over to the press in any way.",
  "He’s stating that the reason he had a chat with the Russian lawyer was because she promised to have dirt on Clinton.",
  "https://t.co/FdT1D4hfhz — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017\n\nHe’s not the only one on the defensive.",
  "Back in December, she had flatly denied that there was any contact with Russians trying to meddle in the election.",
  "It also doesn’t help Trump Jr.’s case that he has changed his story in 24 hours, as the Washington Post reports.",
  "Issues aren’t negotiated at that level unless aides helping with meeting prep thought it was worth bringing up.",
  "Trump claims Comey leaked classified intelligence\n\nSet your “Days Without Comey News” counter back to zero.",
  "The TV report does work in Trump’s favor, though, which is surely why the president wanted to highlight it.",
  "To that end...\n\nTrump agreed to work with Russia to fight election hacking\n\nYes, you read that right.",
  "Worse than that, it shows Trump is still willing to wade publicly into an open Russia investigation.",
  "After all, Fox & Friends misread the Hill report, and Trump took what he saw on TV at face value.",
  "But Comey’s reputation would take a hit if it emerged that he’d leaked classified information.",
  "2/3 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 9, 2017\n\nRubio wasn’t the only critic from Trump’s party.",
  "And if you missed any of it because you wanted to enjoy a politics-free weekend, no worries.",
  "So it’s safe to say the scandal-ridden administration is now more even more scandal-ridden.",
  "So far, there’s no evidence Comey did such a thing, but that didn’t stop the president.",
  "Trump, Jr. doesn’t think he’s been inconsistent in his statements about the meeting.",
  "(The president, a spokesperson told the Times, did not know about this meeting.)",
  "This revelation will certainly pique the interest of those investigators.",
  "It’s up to the investigators to determine just how sketchy it really was.",
  "Veselnitskaya didn’t have the information she claimed to have.",
  "Fox & Friends aired a segment based on a piece in the Hill.",
  "In response to further Q's I simply provided more details.",
  "He took to Twitter this morning to firmly make that case.",
  "That wasn’t the smartest thing for him to admit.",
  "It turns out the conversation was a dud.",
  "There were two eye-opening developments.",
  "Trump is not taking the criticism well.",
  "It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!",
  "We’ve got you covered.",
  "Here’s what happened.",
  "Seriously."
