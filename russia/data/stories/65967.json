  "As Steve Coll writes in his book Private Empire, ExxonMobil during this time was helping broker stronger ties between the Bush administration and Vladimir Putin, since “the Bush administration had decided that American foreign policy would embrace and promote the direct ownership of Russian oil by U.S. corporations.” In 2011, the company entered a $500-billion joint venture to drill on the Arctic shelf and Black Sea, and another shale-development deal in Siberia.",
  "As the International Crisis Group’s Joost Hiltermann told me in December: “The Kurds are taking unilateral steps to incorporate these areas, and they're using companies such as Exxon, who are willing to be used, in order to further that goal.”\n\nTillerson has made his financial disclosures and ethics agreement public, as Bloomberg noted, making him the only Trump cabinet pick to have done so thus far.",
  "Tillerson is certain to field questions on whether he can remain objective where Russia is concerned, particularly on the issue of sanctions against the country in connection with its involvement in Ukraine or the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.",
  "“[I]t's up to me and the leadership and the corporation to insure that at all times though we are consistent with all of the laws, all of the rules, wherever we are operating anywhere in the world,” he told Charlie Rose in 2013.",
  "In addition, Tillerson, pursuant to federal law, must recuse himself from making decisions impacting ExxonMobil for one to two years, which could be difficult considering the company’s extensive global reach.",
  "He has worked out a complex arrangement with the State Department through which ExxonMobil will deposit his $180 million retirement payout into an independent trust to help avoid conflicts of interest.",
  "Unwinding his more than 2 million shares of ExxonMobil stock promises to be a far steeper challenge, due to the company’s strict liquidation policies.",
  "But these projects were halted in 2014, when the United States and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and Crimea.",
  "Tillerson has spoken frequently about long-term energy security, and his willingness to pursue deals in unstable countries.",
  "In one instance in 2011, ExxonMobil struck an exploration deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq.",
  "He has also pledged to divest from 156 entities in more than a dozen countries within 90 days of his confirmation.",
  "In interviews, Tillerson has touted ExxonMobil’s reputation for conducting business on firm legal footing.",
  "In striking the agreement, ExxonMobil, arguably, had bolstered the cause of Kurdish self-determination.",
  "Some of the blocks included in the deal edged into territory disputed by the Iraqi government.",
  "For his efforts, Tillerson received the Russian Order of Friendship Prize from Putin in 2013.",
  "One of the sanctioned individuals is Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft."
