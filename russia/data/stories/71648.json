  "(CNN) The U.S. military will be sending dozens of tanks, Bradley armored fighting vehicles and self-propelled howitzers to allied countries in the Baltics and Eastern Europe in response to Russian actions in the Ukraine, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Tuesday.",
  "\"One of [Putin's] stated views is a longing for the past and that's where we have a different perspective on the world and even on Russia's future,\" he told reporters en route to Germany, in response to a question about whether Putin is a rational actor.",
  "Carter also addressed comments Putin made last week, announcing the addition of 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles to Russia's nuclear arsenal, a move Carter said reflected \"posturing\" on the Russian leader's part.",
  "\"We need to explain to those who doubt the value of our NATO commitments that the security of Europe is vital to everything else we hold dear,\" Carter said at a press event with his German counterpart Monday.",
  "The equipment, enough to arm one combat brigade, will be positioned in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland, Carter announced at a press conference with U.S. allies in Estonia.",
  "Orysia Lutsevych, an analyst with the Chatham House think tank in London, said the U.S. and its NATO allies should have been making these kind of statement to Moscow sooner.",
  "During the Cold War, the U.S. had the same amount of armor, a brigade, stationed in just one small part of what was then West Germany, said retired Brig.",
  "The Obama administration \"should have pushed the Kremlin before reaching to the kind of moment of escalation we are having right now,\" Lutsevych said.",
  "Like what Carter said is planned for the U.S. Army's tanks, U.S. Air Force planes have been rotating through Europe under Operation Atlantic Resolve.",
  "\"The biggest threat on my mind is what's happening with Russia and the activities of Russia,\" James said during a visit to the Paris Air Show.",

  "In March, the Army sent a convoy of armored vehicles on an1,100-mile trek from the Baltics through Poland and the Czech Republic to Germany.",
  "\"I could easily see the day -- though I couldn't tell you the day exactly -- when the F-22, for example, rotates in is a possibility.",
  "While Carter won't be visiting Russia on this trip, Russian President Vladimir Putin's influence looms over the tour's discussions.",
  "Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday, Putin denied his government is behaving aggressively.",
  "Analysts said the size of the armor deployment Carter announced Tuesday was showed it was more symbolic than strategic.",
  "\"We must prepare NATO and our allies for cyber challenges, particularly from Russia,\" Carter said in prepared remarks.",
  "\"We'd like to see us all moving forward, Europe moving forward, and that does not seem to be his stated perspective.\"",
  "I don't see why that couldn't happen in the future,\" James said,\n\nThe Army, too, has been active in these exercises.",
  "\"Nuclear weapons are not something that should be the subject of loose rhetoric by world leadership,\" Carter said.",
  "Participating in those exercises and rotations have been B-2 and B-52 bombers, F-15Cs and A-10 attack planes.",
  "The U.S. defense chief also said Washington and its NATO allies will be boosting cyber defense efforts.",
  "Carter's comments are just the latest in an escalating war of words between U.S. and Russian officials.",

  "Gen. Mark Kimmit, the former military assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.",
  "We have obligations, under the NATO treaty, to defend those countries if attacked.",
  "James said the F-22 Raptor, the Pentagon's premier fighter, could join that list.",
  "Carter said the equipment will be moved around Europe for training and exercises.",
  "We all understand that Russia is a long established nuclear power.",
  "That should hardly be seen as a threat to Russia,\" Kimmit said.",
  "Carter's announcement comes during a week-long tour of Europe.",
  "\"It's extremely worrisome on what's going on in the Ukraine.\"",
  "\"We're sending a message of assurance to our NATO allies.",
  "There is no need for Vladimir Putin to make that point.\"",
  "\"We all understand the gravity of nuclear dangers.",
  "\"We are persistent in pursuing our interests.\"",
  "But the symbolism was important, he said.",
  "\"We are not aggressive,\" Putin said."
