  "The dead Jordanian official, Sharif Ali bin Zeid, reportedly a member of the royal family, may not have been a down-and-dirty case officer with considerable hands-on contact with militants, but al-Balawi surely passed through some kind of intensive screening process with the GID.",
  "Mr. Obama may have foreclosed the possibility of the CIA again aggressively questioning jihadists, but he's kept the door wide open for the rendition of terrorists to countries like Jordan, where the GID does not abide by the Marquess of Queensbury rules in its interrogations.",
  "This operation could well have been months—if not longer—in the making, and neither the Jordanian intelligence service (GID), which supplied the double agent to the CIA, nor Langley apparently had any serious suspicion that al-Balawi still had the soul and will of a jihadist.",
  "The recent death in Afghanistan of seven American counterterrorist officers, one Jordanian intelligence operative, and one exploding al Qaeda double agent ought to give us cause to reflect on the real capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency and al Qaeda.",
  "If Attorney General Eric Holder is so unwise as to bring any charges against a CIA officer for the rough interrogation of an al Qaeda detainee during the Bush administration, the president will likely find himself deluged with damaging CIA-authored leaks.",
  "He may at some level still believe that his let's-just-all-be-friends speech in Cairo last June made a big dent in the hatred that many faithful Muslims have for the U.S., but his practices on the ground are likely to be a lot less touchy-feely.",
  "As a general rule, younger case officers do better intelligence-collection work than older colleagues, whose zeal for Third World field work declines precipitously as their knowledge and expertise in CIA bureaucratic politics increases.",
  "Many CIA officers are married with children and they do not care for long tours of duty in unpleasant spots—the type of service that would give officers a chance of gaining some country expertise, if not linguistic accomplishment.",
  "All of this reinforces the common U.S. military criticism of the Agency in Afghanistan and Iraq: It does not often supply the hard tactical and intimate personal and tribal portraits that military officers need to do their work.",
  "The deadly attack in Fort Hood, Texas, by Maj. Malik Hassan in November, the close call in the air above Detroit on Christmas Day, and now the double-agent suicide bombing in Khost have shocked America's counterterrorist system.",
  "President Obama will, no doubt, continue to say empirically bizarre things about Guantanamo's imprisonment system creating jihadists, but his administration will now likely find another location to jail militants indefinitely.",
  "The GID's large cadre of English-speaking officers makes liaison work easy with Langley, which has never been blessed with a large number of Arabic-speaking officers, particularly within the senior ranks.",
  "Language issues aside, the now-deceased chief of Base Chapman should have kept most of her personnel away from al-Balawi, and should never have allowed seven officers to get that close to him at one time.",
  "Truth be told, even the most elemental CIA activity—meeting recruited agents or \"developmentals\" outside of well-guarded compounds—often cannot be done without contractor-supplied security.",
  "With al-Balawi supposedly providing \"good\" information about al Zawahiri and al Qaeda's terrorist planning, a salivating CIA and the GID proved inattentive to counterintelligence concerns.",
  "According to active-duty CIA officers, the vast majority of Langley's officers are on temporary-duty assignments in Afghanistan, which usually means they depart in under one year.",
  "President Bush and then Central Intelligence Director George Tenet kicked these relationships into hyper-drive after 9/11; President Obama is likely to kick them even further.",
  "Visa issuances, airport security, and perhaps even FBI surveillance of American Muslim militants are likely to become much tougher under Mr. Obama than under Mr. Bush.",
  "National Security Adviser James Jones has already described the 21st century as the liaison century, where intelligence and security services cooperate energetically.",
  "In response, President Barack Obama will likely be obliged to adopt counterterrorist methods that could make his administration as tough as his predecessor's.",
  "It is also highly likely that all of the CIA officers at Chapman—and especially the chief of base, who was a mother of three—were on short-term assignments.",
  "Yet the GID and the CIA got played, and al Qaeda has revealed that it is capable of running sophisticated clandestine operations with sustained deception.",
  "America's systemic intelligence problems were partially on display in the bombing at the CIA's Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost province.",
  "Martin Kozlowski\n\nIndeed, al Qaeda did to us exactly what we intended to do to them: use a mole for a lethal strike against high-value targets.",
  "And the GID, whose skill has been exaggerated in fiction and film and by Hashemite-stroked American case officers, isn't a global service.",
  "Mr. Obama has been much more aggressive than President George W. Bush was in the use of drone attacks and risky paramilitary operations.",
  "Without Blackwater, now renamed Xe, which handles security for Langley in Afghanistan, CIA case officers would likely be paralyzed.",
  "The CIA uses the GID so often not because the Jordanians are brilliant but because the Americans are so often, at best, mediocre.",
  "He did not come into office pledging to reform the CIA, only restrain it from aggressively interrogating al Qaeda terrorists.",
  "Mr. Gerecht, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
  "But the president is likely to compensate for systemic weakness in American intelligence in substantial, effective ways.",
  "Take it far from its tribal society, where it operates with admirable efficiency, and it is nothing to write home about.",
  "During the Cold War, the CIA completely dropped its guard in the pursuit of much-desired Cuban and East German agents.",
  "These three jihadist incidents ought to tell us that America's war with Islamic militancy is far—far—from being over.",
  "The Hashemite monarchy imprisons lots of Islamic militants, and the GID has the responsibility to interrogate them.",
  "Mr. Obama surely knows that one large-scale terrorist strike inside the U.S. could effectively end his presidency.",
  "His counterterrorist adviser, John Brennan, is as institutional a case officer as Langley has ever produced.",
  "There is near zero chance that the president will attempt to improve the Agency operationally in the field.",
  "Professionally, one has to admire the skill of suicide bomber Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi's handlers.",
  "In the case of al-Balawi, it appears the target was Ayman al Zawahiri, Osama bin Ladin's top deputy.",
  "But experience does breed cynicism, which doesn't appear to have been in abundance at the CIA base.",
  "The CIA has often compensated for its internal weaknesses through liaising with foreigners.",
  "Moreover, security concerns usually trap these officers into a limited range of contacts.",
  "Whereas al Qaeda is showing increasing proficiency, the same cannot be said for the CIA.",
  "Army officers are generally among the natives vastly more than their CIA counterparts.",
  "One can easily envision him expanding such attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere.",
  "Most of our assets were plants given to us by Cuban and East German intelligence.",
  "Worse, al Qaeda showed skill that had been lacking in many of its operations.",
  "Too many of President Bush's released detainees have returned to terrorism.",
  "Mr. Obama would be a fool to confront the CIA on two fronts.",
  "Traditional operational compartmentation clearly broke down.",
  "Competent case officers can get duped by a good double.",
  "What does this all mean for President Obama?",
  "(The same is true for the State Department.)",
  "The officers at Chapman were probably young.",
  "This isn't necessarily bad.",
  "That is an impressive feat.",
  "The report card isn't good.",
  "This is all for the good.",
  "The result?"
