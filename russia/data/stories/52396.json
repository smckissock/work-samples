  "The financial sector and the oil and natural gas industries would likely be the first targets of Iran’s renewed digital assaults, according to Read, the FireEye analyst, because of the banking industry’s “importance to the U.S. and [the] importance of enforcing sanctions.”\n\n“And with oil and natural gas,” he added, “that’s someplace where Iran has a lot of eggs in that basket.”\n\nThe one thing that might keep Iran’s hackers at bay if the deal falls apart would be the regime’s contentment to “stand back and enjoy watching the rest of the world turn against the U.S.,” said George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he researches nuclear and cyber issues.",
  "If Trump and Congress reject the Iran nuclear deal, however, experts believe the country would swiftly train its focus back on the U.S. Trump has indicated that he may not recertify Iran’s compliance with the agreement, which would trigger a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose sanctions on Iran.",
  "But after the U.S. and six partners began discussions with Iran in 2013 to lift some economic sanctions in exchange for limits on Tehran’s nuclear program, the country’s hackers have largely spared the U.S., focusing instead on industrial espionage and hitting rival Middle Eastern powers.",
  "Trump has strongly hinted he wants to ax the deal, telling the United Nations General Assembly last week that it was “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into” and later saying he had already made up his mind on the issue.",

  "During the talks, Iranian hackers spied on Western diplomats to gather intelligence about negotiation strategies using a level of skill not seen before, said McClure, but they scaled back the DDoS attacks that had been battering the banking sector.",
  "Meanwhile, said Read, Iran also shifted away from destructive attacks on Western infrastructure, focusing these efforts instead “on their neighborhood.”\n\nThe parties signed the nuclear agreement in July 2015, after almost two years of formal talks.",
  "“They’ve developed a more mature way of thinking about establishing offensive cyber capabilities.”\n\nMcClure expects Iran would use more zero-day exploits, which are tools designed to take advantage of previously unknown technological flaws.",

  "Since then, Iran’s digital shift has continued, with the country deploying its ruinous digital power on its neighbors — mostly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — while collecting corporate intel on its foreign competition.",
  "“I personally think they’ll double down their efforts and we’ll start to see a lot more attacks,” said Stuart McClure, the CEO of security firm Cylance, which revealed one of Iran’s most pervasive hacking groups in 2014.",
  "One of the hackers was also charged with infiltrating the control systems of a New York dam , a disquieting development, given the destruction that could be caused if the intruder had been able to manipulate the dam.",
  "Iran’s current Western hacking is limited almost entirely to commercial espionage and dissident surveillance, but the country could quickly redirect its efforts in the event of a rupture of the nuclear pact.",
  "Cyber specialists said that if the U.S. withdraws from the deal, not only will Iran resume full-scale hacking of American targets, but it will do so with greater discipline and capabilities than last time.",
  "In late 2016, cyber researchers identified a new Iranian hacking campaign targeting Saudi Arabia with a type of malware, dubbed Shamoon, that completely wiped the hard drives of infected computers.",
  "And initially, the country also aimed its cyber forces at the U.S., launching a barrage of distracting attacks on the financial sector and even successfully infiltrating a dam in New York state.",
  "Regardless, Tehran will be frustrated if the U.S. breaks the agreement, and experts agree the country’s digital warriors can help the regime project influence wherever it chooses to do so.",

  "Religious rivalry has long dominated the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE dominated by the Sunni branch of Islam and Iran controlled by the Shia branch.",
  "If Iranian operators can’t craft these tools, they could easily purchase them from other premier digital powers, such as China and North Korea, McClure said.",
  "“We are very concerned and keeping close watch on what kinds of things might manifest against Western targets if that deal falls apart,” said Meyers.",
  "The White House did not respond when asked whether it was worried about Iranian digital retaliation if the U.S. left the nuclear deal.",
  "And even if the country cannot develop certain digital tools itself, it can always buy them from Russia, China or the black market.",
  "Such tools are especially formidable because software engineers may not have a quick fix ready for the flaw being abused.",
  "“They’re plenty good enough to cause a lot of difficulty,” said Ben Read, head of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye.",
