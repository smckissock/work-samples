  "“Grow Fast or Die Slow” sees the rest of the ensemble engrossed in their own ridiculous schemes—Richard’s colleagues Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) imperiously reject all job applicants to Richard’s firm over superficial details, while their former rival Jian Yang (Jimmy O. Yang) concocts a plan to fake someone’s death as part of a hostile tech takeover.",
  "Richard’s idea of a decentralized internet—powered by the processing strength of networked cellphones—is a basic invocation of the blockchain, a tech concept that has its roots in the cryptocurrency movement and has become the latest industry buzzword.",
  "The conflict is a miniaturized version of the war Richard has fought with Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross, playing the maniacal head of a Google-type company) for Silicon Valley’s entire run, only this time it’s Richard who’s the big bully.",
  "Silicon Valley has essentially been on-air long enough for Richard to become the sort of villain he once despised, and it appears Season 5 will center on the tension between his desire to succeed and conquer, and his more altruistic ideals.",
  "Sunday night’s episode, “Grow Fast or Die Slow,” delved into the typically hilarious minutiae of start-up hiring and a battle of wills that breaks out between Richard and a jumped-up new CEO who invented a pizza-centric app.",
  "In the past, Richard has resorted to lying and cheating (even employing a click farm in India in one season) to get what he wanted, motivated by a resolute belief that the technology he’s building will improve the world.",
  "Rightly or wrongly, Judge (and his showrunner Alec Berg) see that kind of superiority complex as what’s driving so many industry CEOs, and compelling them to overlook the more ethically dodgy parts of their business.",
  "In later interviews, Judge referenced on-set tension as the reason for Miller’s departure, but I still wondered at the time if the show would function as well without him, given his uniquely bombastic role.",
  "In its first four years, Silicon Valley had another main character to give voice to the undercurrent of ego among its cast of coders—Erlich Bachman, the bloviating venture capitalist played by T.J. Miller.",
  "But the “decentralized internet” concept is developed enough to straddle the line between fantasy and reality, and part of Season 5’s arc will follow Richard’s attempts to make it the latter.",
  "As the challenges pile up, the viewer grasps just how disastrous any public failure would be for Richard—which makes his moral corner-cutting easier to understand every time it happens.",
  "Like many a Silicon Valley invention, Richard’s dream is still far from being realized (and is simplified for viewers like myself who barely understand what blockchain is).",
  "But partway through Season 4, news broke that Miller would be leaving the show for good, and the finale saw Erlich being summarily abandoned in Tibet.",
  "Judge may not have seen the Cambridge Analytica scandal coming, but that’s hardly the first time a tech giant has covered up a data leak.",
  "Part of the brilliance of Silicon Valley is how convincing the details of Richard’s world are.",
  "As with any soaring American industry, ego often gets in the way."
