  "BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption.",
  "Google is likely looking to link Android Pay with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a national platform that leverages digital IDs to make it easier for users to transact via mobile, according to the Economic Times.",
  "Russia could bring strong conditions for adoption and habit formation, because Android holds the lion's share of Russia's smartphone market, and 38% of cardholders already use physical contactless products.",
  "Google has been reportedly looking for ways to move into India's digital payments market, which has seen rapid growth since last year's demonetization that removed 86% of currency from circulation.",
  "Mobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants.",
  "Android Pay will also have a wide acceptance network â€” 25% of Russian terminals are NFC-enabled, and major department and grocery stores have already announced plans to accept the wallet.",
  "Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits.",
  "But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years.",
  "Google likely wants to leverage the UPI to capture some of those gains while accommodating the unique payments ecosystem in India, where card and terminal penetration is low.",
  "BI Intelligence believes that launches in new markets, rather than growing engagement in existing markets, were the catalyst for Apple's 450% annual growth last quarter.",
  "Here are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nIn our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year.",
  "Android Pay will launch in Canada on Wednesday, likely to most of the country's cardholders, though specific partnerships haven't yet been announced.",
  "Android Pay, which is currently available in 11 markets, including Australia, Japan, and the US, is seeking to grow its reach in 2017.",
  "It counts 15 bank partnerships, including Sberbank, the country's largest issuer, and other major players like VBR-24 and Alfa Bank.",
  "By scaling into markets with many users and strong engagement potential, Android could catalyze both short- and long-term growth.",
  "The tech giant is also eyeing Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Taiwan for potential launches this year, according to The Verge.",
  "Finding ways to rapidly scale into new markets is the biggest path to growth for mobile wallets as adoption stagnates.",
  "The wallet has also set its sights on India, perhaps the most rapid digital payment growth market worldwide.",
  "Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption.",
  "Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off.",
  "BI Intelligence\n\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers.",
  "This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay.",
  "This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020.",
  "Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs.",
  "We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion.",
  "Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption.",
  "And it has other launches on the horizon, including Canada.",
  "New markets are mobile wallets' path to growth.",
