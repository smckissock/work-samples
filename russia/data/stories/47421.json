  "Dorsey Carson, arguing on behalf of Fair Vote Project and its leader Kyle Taylor, said plenty of evidence supports the lawsuit being heard in Mississippi, including a lease that Eldon signed with the university in February.",
  "The lease, filed publicly for the first time Tuesday, shows the state economic development agency controlled by Bryant agreed to give Eldon and the university $100,000 to help complete office space for Big Data Dolphins.",

  "She said Eldon never \"scraped\" Facebook profiles for data, saying that's illegal in the United Kingdom and would result in the company being banned from Facebook.",
  "\"This is a lawsuit between British people and it's about the alleged use of British people's personal data,\" lawyer Sterling Kidd argued Tuesday in Jackson.",
