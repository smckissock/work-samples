  "More Social Media coverage on Forbes:\n\nGoogle Chrome Browser Now Available On Daydream VR Headsets\n\nYouTube VR Is Now On Samsung Gear VR -- And With A New Shared Viewing Feature\n\nThe Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Content Hitting Netflix This August\n\nOf yet, these tools don't provide specified data around types of usage -- desktop vs. mobile, active vs. passive -- but this step marks another effort by the social media giant to shift its image in the public eye.",
  "The goal of this new suite of tools, per the statement, was to encourage users to engage with their platform in healthy ways, rather than the \"passive scrolling\" that produces demonstrable negative health effects:\n\nWe developed these tools based on collaboration and inspiration from leading mental health experts and organizations, academics, our own extensive research and feedback from our community.",
  "In an official blog post this morning, Facebook announced an \"activity dashboard\" to help users better manage time spent on social media, which includes daily reminders, notification limits, and a time-tracker that shows how much time you've spent on the apps.",
  "Citizens and governments worldwide are beginning to understand the implications of data and social media in swaying public opinion -- as evinced by California's recent data privacy legislation and Facebook's precipitous drop on Wall Street.",
  "Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them.",
  "The dashboard allows users to set time limits on usage, after which the app will send a notification -- but with no \"hard stop\" feature, it's up to you to adhere to your self-imposed time frame.",
  "These new tools offer insight into the ways Facebook -- and by proxy, other major tech companies -- will seek to maintain appeal with a more tech-savvy, tech-literate populace.",
  "For more emerging technology and media coverage, including cryptocurrency, blockchain, VR/AR, AI, and more, follow Jesse Damiani on Forbes and on Twitter.",
  "This also follows major mainstream backlash to the revelations in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.",
  "We want the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram to be intentional, positive and inspiring.",
  "These tools are available today to U.S. users, with a global rollout in the coming weeks.",
  "No more pretending you aren't addicted to social media."
