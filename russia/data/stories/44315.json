  "In response to outcry from users over how much data third-party apps can collect on them, the social media giant announced Wednesday significant new limits, restricting apps from getting access to certain kinds of data and requiring developers to get its approval before offering particular types of apps.",
  "Other dating apps, including Bumble and Hinge, that also allow customers to use their Facebook credentials to create or log into accounts, didn't appear to be affected by the social networking company's privacy-related changes.",
  "Facebook has been reeling from the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved a Trump-linked data firm improperly obtaining personal information from as many as 87 million Facebook users.",
  "Some widespread changes Facebook made early in the day to the types of data developers can access from its site ended up thwarting the ability of many Tinder customers to access the dating app.",
  "\"This was part of the changes that we announced today, and we are working with Tinder to address this issue,\" a Facebook spokesman told Business Insider before the problem was corrected.",
  "The technical problem they encountered happened soon after Facebook announced a set of sweeping restrictions limiting how much data third-party app developers can collect.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nTinder users who wanted to swipe and match on the dating app were out of luck for much of Wednesday.",
  "But when users went to give those extra permissions, they were prevented from logging back in to Tinder; instead the app displayed an error message.",
  "Tinder users discovered the problem when they noticed the app was asking for additional permissions to connect their accounts to Facebook.",
  "Both Facebook and Tinder confirmed the problem, and Facebook confirmed it was connected to the increased privacy restrictions.",
  "This information is used to create fuller profiles, verify authenticity and provide support,\" the message read.",
  "\"We found a resolution and quickly resumed service,\" a company representative said in an emailed statement.",
  "\"We ask our users to ensure that they have updated the app and are running the most recent version.\"",
  "By late Wednesday afternoon, however, Tinder said it had fixed what it called a \"technical issue.\"",
  "Tinder customers reported earlier on Wednesday they were having trouble accessing the dating app.",
  "\"Tinder requires you provide additional Facebook permissions in order to use a Tinder account.",
  "Tinder, meanwhile, said in a tweet it was \"working to have everyone swiping again soon.\"",
  "The Facebook spokesman declined to elaborate on what caused the problem.",
  "Many Tinder customers use their Facebook creditials to log into the app."
