  "But given Russian President Vladimir Putin's demonstrated willingness to accept domestic economic pain to further foreign policy objectives, the coming months will likely see favorable financing deals and Russian support for major infrastructure projects -- such as the recently agreed Turkish Stream pipeline -- as well as increased cultural and political ties between Athens and Moscow.",
  "Yet today, a Greek government with strong ties to Russia would not only perpetuate the Russian narrative that NATO is weak and divided but could easily exert veto power over NATO operations or any NATO response to potential Russian aggression in the Balkans or Eastern Europe.",
  "Greek ties with Russia have been improving since the victory of the left-wing Syriza party in January's elections, and Greek leaders have made no secret of the fact that they consider Moscow a possible alternative source of funding if their European negotiations fail.",
  "The decision by voters will worsen Greece's economic turmoil, and though its leaders argue that a \"no\" vote is simply a mandate for further negotiations, it is widely believed that the vote will accelerate the country's progress toward an exit from the eurozone.",
  "It is true that the initial impact of a Grexit would simply be to provide Russia with a wonderful propaganda coup, allowing anchors on Russian state TV to highlight further evidence of the decline of the European Union and of Western civilization more broadly.",
  "There is no precedent for a member state leaving the Euro, and Greece may remain a member of the European Union even if it leaves the single currency..Greek leaders would have little to lose in choosing to veto any future extension of the sanctions on Russia.",

  "Sunday's referendum results will leave them with a dilemma: They can offer a more generous, politically unpopular bailout deal in an attempt to keep Greece in the eurozone, or begin the process of a costly and damaging separation.",
  "In doing so, European leaders and their U.S. counterparts must bear in mind not only the financial fallout, but also the unsettling security implications of an EU and NATO member state slipping into Moscow's orbit.",
  "After all, Russia is suffering substantial economic problems as a result of low oil prices combined with American and European sanctions and might itself face balance of payment problems in the next few years.",
  "While relatively unlikely, a new Greek withdrawal from NATO would result in the loss of strategically placed bases, placing an increasing burden on Turkey to support NATO's southern security needs.",
  "This would be a major strategic concern for NATO, allowing Russia to expand its military influence not only in Crimea and the Black Sea, but to obtain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean.",
  "It's even possible that a Grexit and closer Athens-Moscow ties could lead Greece to withdraw entirely from NATO, moving instead toward closer security cooperation with Russia.",
