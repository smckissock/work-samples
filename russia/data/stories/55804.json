  "A statement from the government spokesman’s office said the U.S. State Department was being “misled” by a disinformation campaign appearing in international media and “strongly assisted by Soros organizations.”\n\nAt the center of the dispute are some civic groups supported by Hungarian-American financier George Soros, such as the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocate which also provides legal aid to asylum-seekers, and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.",
