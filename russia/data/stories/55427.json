  "He portrayed himself as a “peace-seeker.” He even expressed sympathy for Podobnyy, the spy— whom he described as a “junior Russian diplomat.” In an email to the Guardian, Page complained that Obama had persecuted Podobnyy, Sporyshev, and him “in accordance with Cold War traditions.”\n\nHe wrote: “The time has come to break out of this Cold War mentality and start focusing on real threats, rather than obsolete and imagined bogeymen in Russia.”\n\nPage’s loyalty to the SVR was breathtaking.",
  "Page’s reaction to this offer was positive, Steele wrote, adding that Page was “generally non-committal in response.”\n\nSteele obtained further information from his high-placed source, which said that the Sechin meeting had taken place on either July 7 or 8—the same day as or the day after Page’s graduate lecture.",
  "“He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” his former boss, Sergei Aleksashenko, said, adding that Page was “without any special talents or accomplishments,” “in no way exceptional,” and “a gray spot.”\n\nThree years later, Page returned to New York and to his new office next to Trump Tower.",
  "At the end, Walker said, Page was “spirited off.”\n\nClearly, Page was reluctant to give any clues about a Trump administration’s Russia policy or how Trump might succeed in strengthening ties where Obama and George W. Bush had both failed.",
  "Not only that but using supposedly flawed material supplied by Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer whose dossier accused Trump of consorting with Russian president and former KGB operative Vladimir Putin.",
  "Chris Barter—the former CEO of Goldman Sachs Moscow—described him as an “extremely charming and smart guy, on top of his numbers operationally.” It was clear that Sechin had Russia’s entire security services at his disposal.",
  "Excerpted from the book Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win published by Vintage Books, an imprint of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.",
  "In 2014 Page had written a sycophantic piece that lauded Sechin for his “great accomplishments.” In a blog for Global Policy, Page wrote that Sechin had done more to advance U..S.-Russian relations than anybody in decades.",
  "The venue was Moscow’s World Trade Center\n\nRussia’s media hailed Page as a “celebrated American economist.” This, despite the fact that Page’s lecture was distinctly strange—a content-free ramble verging on the bizarre.",
  "If a future Trump administration dropped “Ukraine-related sanctions,” there could be an “associated move” in the area of “bilateral energy co-operation.” In other words, lucrative contracts for U.S. energy firms.",
  "In this second reading, the purpose of the memo was to offer succor to President Donald Trump and to discredit the investigation into Trump, Russia and collusion led by special counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "This was a strange business—Kremlin officers careening around Manhattan, spycraft involving fake umbrellas, and an American intelligence source who spent more time in Moscow than his Russian handlers.",
  "That meant feeding him “empty promises.” Podobnyy would play up his connections to Russia’s trade delegation, to Sporyshev, and pretend his SVR colleague might “push contracts” the American’s way.",
  "Dated July 19, 2016, Steele’s field memorandum was titled: “Russia: Secret Kremlin meetings attended by Trump advisor Carter Page in Moscow.”\n\nSteele’s information came from anonymous sources.",
  "Page’s problem, then, was that he had an unfortunate habit of seeking out Russian spies—ones in their twenties like Podobnyy and older ones like Sechin, either directly or via underlings.",
  "Or, as he put it in chauvinist terms: “In order to be close you need to either fuck them or use other levers to execute my requests.”\n\nThe Russian spies, however, had one promising lead.",
  "He was smart enough to get academic qualifications: fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, master’s from Georgetown University, a degree from New York University’s business school.",
  "One person who met him around this period described the encounter as “excruciating.” Page was “awkward” and “uncomfortable” and “broke into a sweat.”\n\nPage’s re´sume´ was curious, too.",
  "Of the Steele dossier, Barter told me: “Everything is believable.”\n\nAccording to Steele, Sechin raised with Page the Kremlin’s desire for the United States to lift sanctions on Russia.",
  "Eleven days after Page flew back from Russia to New York, Steele filed a memo to Fusion GPS, the business intelligence firm headed by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson.",
  "When Putin was elected president, Sechin became his deputy chief of staff and, from 2004, executive chairman of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer.",
  "The CIA and FBI were sifting through a mound of intercept material featuring Page, much of it “Russians talking to Russians,” according to one former National Security Council member.",
  "When Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote to Comey in early autumn, he cited “disturbing” contacts between a Trump adviser and “high-ranking sanctioned individuals.” That was Page.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nTo answer that question meaningfully it is necessary to go back—to 2013, and to a group of jaded Putin spies working deep undercover in downtown Manhattan.",
  "One of his SVR colleagues was Igor Sporyshev, who was working covertly as a “trade representative.” Neither man was aware that the FBI had a bug inside their SVR office.",
  "***\n\nAccording to the Steele dossier —vehemently disputed by Page and subsequently rubbished by Nunes, and Republicans —the real purpose of Page’s trip was clandestine.",
  "This sometimes happened outside Buryakov’s bank office on Third Avenue—an inconspicuous brown tower with a 1960s abstract sculpture at street level opposite the foyer.",
  "Its founder, Ian Bremmer, later described Page as his “most wackadoodle alumnus.” Page’s vehemently pro-Kremlin views meant that “he wasn’t a good fit,” Bremmer said.",
  "His relationship with the journal fizzled out when he wrote an opinion piece lavishly praising a pro-Russian candidate ahead of the U.S. presidential election—Trump.",
  "The memo, according to its putative author, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed unprecedented abuses by the FBI and Justice Department.",
  "According to the Washington Post, quoting a campaign manager, Page wrote policy memos and attended three dinners in Washington for Trump’s foreign advisory team.",
  "The FBI presented its evidence before a secret tribunal— the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, or FISA, court, which handles sensitive national security cases.",
  "The FBI intercepts record:\n\nPODOBNYY: [Male-1] wrote that he is sorry, he went to Moscow and forgot to check his inbox, but he wants to meet when he gets back.",
  "Russian journalists were sceptical that it had ended up with Trump; it was more probable, they reasoned, that it would have travelled to Putin and Sechin.",
  "He advised Gazprom on transactions, including a deal to buy a stake in an oil and gas eld near Sakhalin, the desolate island on Russia’s Pacific coast.",
  "However, in testimony to Nunes’ House Intelligence committee last November Page admitted meeting Andrey Baranov, Rosneft’s head of investor relations.",
  "This was “the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatized) stake in Rosneft in return.” In other words, a chunk of Rosneft was being sold off.",
  "He described Page’s PowerPoint presentation as “really weird.” “It looked as if it had been done for a Kazakhstan gas conference,” Walker said.",
  "“He was talking about the United States’ attempts to spread democracy, and how disgraceful they were.”\n\nPage was Trump’s leading Russia expert.",
  "Whatever Page’s motives were for helping Russian intelligence—greed, naivety, stupidity—his actions surely justified the FBI’s interest in him.",
  "One former Eurasia Group colleague said he was stunned when he discovered Page had mysteriously become one of Trump’s foreign policy advisers.",
  "Podobnyy and Sporyshev approached their duties with a certain cynicism laced with boredom and a shot of homesickness, the FBI tapes revealed.",
  "Page “expressed interest” and confirmed that were Trump to become US president, “then sanctions on Russia would be lifted,” Steele wrote.",
  "Page’s rampant pro-Moscow views were at odds with the US State Department under Clinton and with almost all American scholars of Russia.",
  "According to an “associate,” Sechin was so keen to lift personal and corporate Western sanctions that he offered Page an unusual bribe.",
  "From the atrium you could take the elevator up to the Trump Tower public garden on the fourth floor, with its sparrows and maple trees.",
  "The second was with Igor Diveykin, a senior official from Putin’s presidential administration and its internal political department.",
  "What appeared to recommend him to Trump was his boundless enthusiasm for Putin and his corresponding loathing of Obama and Clinton.",
  "The American willing to provide information to Putin’s foreign intelligence officers rented a working space at 590 Madison Avenue.",
  "During his navy days, he spent lavishly and drove a black Mercedes, according to a friend from his academy class, Richard Guerin.",
  "***\n\nPage is a balding figure in his mid-forties, with buzz-cut hair and the super-lean physique of a cyclist or fitness fanatic.",
  "The memo alleged that the bureau bugged his communications after deliberately duping the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.",
  "Reprinted by permission of Vintage Books, an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House.",
  "The board only discovered the deal on December 7, hours after Sechin had already recorded his TV meeting with Putin revealing it.",
  "But he can’t speak or do public politics,” Sergei Sokolov, deputy editor of the liberal Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said of Sechin.",
  "Only later— once Trump had all but secured the nomination—did a law firm employed by the Democrats take over the Trump contract.",
  "Simpson had initially begun investigating Trump and Russia at the behest of the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website.",
  "In early December—less than a month after Trump won the White House—Rosneft announced it was selling 19.5 percent of its stock.",
  "This was one of the biggest privatizations since the 1990s and, on the face of it, a vote of confidence in the Russian economy.",
  "Since then, Page had held further meetings with Russian operatives that had not been publicly disclosed, the application said.",
  "Any application of this kind was voluminous—as then FBI Director James Comey put it, these were often thicker than his wrists.",
  "Page, by contrast, was the rarest of things: an American who apparently believed that Putin was wise and virtuous and kind.",
  "Typically, Sporyshev would ring Buryakov and tell him he had to give him “something”—a ticket, a book, a hat, an umbrella.",
  "He had approached two young women working in financial consultancy who had recently graduated from a New York university.",
  "He wasn’t a smart person.”\n\nPage’s real qualification for the role, it appeared, had little to do with his restless CV.",
  "In a blog post for Global Policy, an online journal, he wrote that Putin wasn’t to blame for the 2014 Ukraine conflict.",
  "In June 2013 counter-intelligence agent Gregory Monaghan interviewed Page in connection with the Podobnyy–SVR spy ring.",
  "Within hours, the Trump campaign had disavowed Page—casting him out as a nobody who had exaggerated his links to Trump.",
  "The second was “Carter Page, PhD.” Given Trump’s obvious lack of experience of world affairs, this was a pivotal job.",
  "He got hooked on [the Russian state energy company] Gazprom, thinking that if they have a project, he could rise up.",
  "At the time that Page joined Trump’s campaign, Buryakov pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent.",
  "Sechin was a wronged Russian statesman, in Page’s view, unfairly punished and sanctioned by the Obama White House.",
  "Podobnyy wasn’t an “imagined bogeyman” but a career operative working against the interests of the United States.",
  "And Russian ambassadors like Sergei Kislyak, whom Page met in summer 2016 at the Republican national convention.",
  "He would be willing to personally reward anyone who advanced the objectives of the Russian state, Barter added.",
  "The official reportedly told Page that the Kremlin had assembled a dossier of compromising materal on Clinton.",
  "He had come to see “business leaders and thought leaders,” he told RIA Novosti, the Russian state news agency.",
  "Seemingly, there was a mole deep inside Rosneft—a person who discussed sensitive matters with other Russians.",
  "As Page tells it, it was while working as an investment banker that he struck up a relationship with Gazprom.",
  "Or you could queue up with Japanese and German tourists at the Trump Tower basement restaurant and salad bar.",
  "And yet in the question-and-answer session it emerged that Page couldn’t really understand or speak Russian.",
  "Shaun Walker, the Guardian’s Russia correspondent, had attended an event given by Page the previous evening.",
  "He carried the boss’s briefcase and lurked outside Putin’s ground-floor office in St Petersburg’s city hall.",
  "He hinted—or even “indicated more strongly”—that the Russian leadership had damaging material on Trump, too.",
  "Any brokerage fee would be substantial, in the region of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars.",
  "***\n\nPage’s multiple interactions with senior Russians were a matter of growing concern to US intelligence.",
  "Page was someone who might give sharper definition to the candidate’s views on future US–Russian relations.",
  "One of Russia’s top private universities, the New Economics School, invited Page to give a public lecture.",
  "This was no ordinary event but the prestigious commencement address to its class of graduating students.",
  "The fact that Republicans opposed to Trump had begun the inquiry was nowhere to be found in Nunes’ memo.",
  "In the classified briefing to congressional leaders in late August 2016 Page’s name figured prominently.",
  "The White House’s superior “smack-down” approach had “started the crisis in the first place,” he wrote.",
  "His audience included students and local Trump fans, some of whom were visibly nodding off by the end.",
  "Based on his own Moscow experience, Barter said that meetings with Sechin came about at short notice.",
  "As the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, Steele’s research formed only part of the application.",
  "Sporyshev’s biggest headache was finding Americans willing to become intelligence sources for Russia.",
  "He worked in New York under official “cover”: attache´ to Russia’s delegation to the United Nations.",
  "The bureau argued that there were strong grounds to believe that Page was acting as a Russian agent.",
  "Since then, however, Page had become a liability to the Trump campaign—and therefore to Russia, too.",
  "The colleague added: “We had wanted people who could engage in critical analysis of what’s going on.",
  "“We were told: ‘Can you bring this guy over?’” one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
  "Page, it seemed, was criticizing U.-.S-led attempts at “regime change” in the former Soviet world.",
  "He spent five years in the navy and served as a Marine intelligence officer in the western Sahara.",
  "Sechin was a former spy and, more importantly, someone who commanded Putin’s absolute confidence.",
  "“Sechin did it all on his own—the government did not take part in this,” one source told Reuters.",
  "In the weeks to come, US and other Western intelligence agencies would examine this deal closely.",
  "He was part of a chain of cultivation and conspiracy that stretched from Moscow to Fifth Avenue.",
  "Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press spokesman, said government leaders had no plans to meet with him.",
  "And, moreover, one who had bad-mouthed Page behind his back, calling him “a bit of an idiot”.",
  "Steele’s mole had known about the plan months before Rosneft’s management board was informed.",
  "The atrium had a pleasant courtyard, with bamboo trees, where you could sit and drink coffee.",
  "As FBI wiretaps showed, the techniques for meeting with Buryakov were distinctly old-school.",
  "Boiled down: the United States’ attempts to spread democracy had brought chaos and disaster.",
  "In the worsening dispute between Putin and the Obama administration, Page sided with Moscow.",
  "Moscow sources suggest that certain people in the Russian government arranged Page’s visit.",
  "In the coming months, the FBI seemed to grow suspicious that Page might be a Russian agent.",
  "There was no proof of this, and neither the Kremlin nor other parties would offer comment.",
  "In 1998 Page spent three months working for the Eurasia Group, a strategy consulting firm.",
  "And were there, in fact, genuine reasons why the FBI might have ground for suspecting him?",
  "The building was linked by a glass atrium to a well-known New York landmark, Trump Tower.",
  "Typically, Sechin’s chief of staff would call up and order a meeting forty minutes later.",
  "There was a drawback: The source—whom the FBI called “Male-1”—was something of a dimwit.",
  "On Friday, Washington was convulsed by a contentious four-page document: the Nunes memo.",
  "Sometimes these meetings took place in the White House, the Russian seat of government.",
  "“I’m not here at all talking about my work outside of my academic endeavor,” Page said.",
  "After all, it was Putin who had smuggled tanks across the border into eastern Ukraine.",
  "The counterview: That Nunes’ memo was a misleading, partisan and shoddy piece of work.",
  "Most remarkable was the unlikely hero at the center of this national row, Carter Page.",
  "In 2004 Page moved to Moscow, where he became an energy consultant with Merrill Lynch.",
  "And a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.",
  "Page’s British academic supervisors failed his doctoral thesis twice, an unusual move.",
  "He didn’t have diplomatic immunity, which meant if he was caught he could go to jail.",
  "According to Politico, few people in Moscow’s foreign business community knew of him.",
  "He had begun his career in the KGB and served as a military translator in Mozambique.",
  "He was in effect Russia’s second most powerful official, its de facto deputy leader.",
  "But not to upset you I will take you to a restaurant and give you an expensive gift.",
  "When not on his Cannondale mountain bike, he is typically dressed in a suit and tie.",
  "In reality, Podobnyy was employed by Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the SVR.",
  "Podobnyy's mission was to recruit Americans and to collect economic intelligence.",
  "At this point it seemed likely that Trump would clinch the Republican nomination.",
  "On other occasions they were in Rosneft’s tower HQ, overlooking the Moskva River.",
  "His partner was Russian—a wealthy former Gazprom manager called Sergei Yatsenko.",
  "In July 2016 Page went back to Russia, in a trip approved by the Trump campaign.",
  "From this point on, the FBI was able to access Page’s electronic communications.",
  "The mole may have been unaware its information was being telegraphed to Steele.",
  "His official day job was at a branch of a Russian state bank in Manhattan, VEB.",
  "There was a simple way of avoiding U.S. surveillance and a FISA court warrant.",
  "In the months to come, Page would vehemently deny the allegations against him.",
  "The stick was flourished during Page’s alleged second meeting, with Diveykin.",
  "He was against US sanctions imposed by Obama on Russia in the wake of Crimea.",
  "In March 2016 candidate Trump met with the Washington Post’s editorial board.",
  "By this point, the Russian spies had been spirited out of the United States.",
  "Trump “should bear this in mind” in his dealings with Moscow, Diveykin said.",
  "Meanwhile, Page’s career as a Trump adviser was entering its terminal phase.",
  "But a privatization on this scale would be the biggest in Russia for years.",
  "Male-1 co-operated, although he says he did not know the Russian was a spy.",
  "One of their tasks was to liaise with another SVR officer, Evgeny Buryakov.",
  "By this point Sechin had been at Putin’s side for more than three decades.",
  "From there he set up a private equity business, Global Energy Capital LLC.",
  "However, according to Steele, Diveykin also delivered an ominous warning.",
  "In the 1990s he worked with Putin in the mayor’s offce in St Petersburg.",
  "Page responded by angrily accusing his examiners of “anti-Russian bias”.",
  "Plus espionage professionals who turned out to be suffering from ennui.",
  "The din from West 57th Street meant the garden wasn’t exactly tranquil.",
  "Moscow had dispatched Podobnyy to the United States under his own name.",
  "Sechin had a rubbery face, narrow-set eyes, and a boxer’s squishy nose.",
  "That summer the bureau decided it was going to bug Page’s phone calls.",
  "The campaign’s ties with Russia were becoming a source of controversy.",
  "All of which made his subsequent rehabilitation by Nunes more bizarre.",
  "Podobnyy approached the consultant at an energy symposium in New York.",
  "Putin was the former head of the SVR's domestic counterpart, the FSB.",
  "Those seeking answers on Trump’s view of sanctions were disappointed.",
  "Or indeed other members of Russia’s underground espionage community?",
  "A day after the Rosneft deal was unveiled, Page flew back to Moscow.",
  "This time Page was an unperson, a toxic figure, at least officially.",
  "It could be summed up like this: Don’t hang out with Russian spies.",
  "Page was the go-between meant to relay this blunt message to Trump.",
  "Sporyshev told Podobnyy he was skeptical anything would come of it.",
  "Page’s apparent Russian sympathies were evident from much earlier.",
  "Over the coming months, Page would vehemently deny any wrongdoing.",
  "It was edited out of Durham University in the north of England.",
  "It was an inglorious end, and his troubles were just beginning.",
  "You get the documents from him and go tell him to fuck himself.",
  "I don’t know, but it’s obvious he wants to earn loads of money.",
  "His speech in Moscow had provoked comment, much of it adverse.",
  "The application included Page’s earlier testimony to the FBI.",
  "This is a guy who has no critical insight into the situation.",
  "In this case that was someone described as “close” to Sechin.",
  "In a report they described his work as “verbose” and “vague”.",
  "It’s unclear where this meeting, if it happened, took place.",
  "To do this lawfully, federal agents had to obtain a warrant.",
  "In Moscow, Page had held two secret meetings, Steele wrote.",
  "According to FBI court documents, the two swapped contacts.",
  "Plus he writes to me in Russian [to] practise the language.",
  "This was a guy—an energy consultant based in New York City.",
  "The Bureau was secretly listening to their conversations.",
  "Apparently, his attempts to meet Trump personally failed.",
  "These embarrassing details surfaced in a report by Yahoo!",
  "Luke Harding is a foreign correspondent at the Guardian.",
  "As accredited diplomats, they were entitled to fly home.",
  "Page’s view of the world was not unlike the Kremlin’s.",
  "Podobnyy explained he intended to string Male-1 along.",
  "Failing that, there was Starbucks on the first floor.",
  "Four separate federal judges approved these renewals.",
  "A stint as deputy prime minister was not successful.",
  "He even handed him documents about the energy world.",
  "Even the Russian cabinet had been kept in the dark.",
  "This article tagged under: Washington And The World",
  "He “may briefly have mentioned it,” Page admitted.",
  "He personally met with Sechin six times, he added.",
  "Who were the candidate’s foreign policy advisers?",
  "Sechin functioned as Putin’s scowling gatekeeper.",
  "An initial ninety-day warrant was later renewed.",
  "Page’s own explanation for his visit was vague.",
  "During his previous July visit he’d been feted.",
  "And might possibly give it to Trump’s campaign.",
  "It was, boom: ‘Can you come now?’” Barter said.",
  "PODOBNYY: This is intelligence method to cheat!",
