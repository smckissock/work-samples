  "See: Facebook steps up Washington lobbying in face of Russian ad blowback and talk of new regulation\n\nPlus: Twitter aims to get a jump on federal regulators by promising new ad transparency\n\nSuch action is vital if we are to break the vicious cycle of disinformation and political polarization that undermines democracies’ ability to function.",
  "See: Trump White House takes delayed step toward implementing Russia sanctions\n\nDialogue between Congress and Facebook FB, -1.58% , Twitter TWTR, -0.39% and Google GOOG, -3.01% GOOGL, -2.92% has intensified in the last few weeks, as clear evidence of ad purchases by Russian entities in the run-up to the 2016 election has emerged.",
  "This past June, Germany’s parliament adopted a law that includes a provision for fines of up to €50 million ($59 million) on popular sites like Facebook FB, -1.58% and YouTube GOOGL, -2.92% if they fail to remove “obviously illegal” content, such as hate speech and incitements to violence, within 24 hours.",
  "Facebook is the chief culprit: With an average of 1.32 billion daily active users, its impact is massive, yet the company refuses to give outside researchers access to the information needed to understand the most fundamental questions at the intersection of the internet and politics.",

  "“By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing and fake news networks,” according to a recent exposé, groups like Cambridge Analytica can create personalized, adaptive and ultimately addictive propaganda.",
  "It also means that people who otherwise might consume news in moderation are being inundated with political polemic and debate, including extreme positions and falsehoods, which heighten the risk of misinforming or polarizing wider swaths of the public.",

  "Moreover, information that is filtered through networks of friends can result in an echo chamber of news that reinforces one’s own biases (though there is considerable uncertainty about how serious a problem this represents).",
  "Rather than receiving our information directly from institutional gatekeepers, who, despite often-flawed execution, were fundamentally committed to meeting editorial standards, today we acquire it via peer-to-peer sharing.",
  "MENLO PARK, Calif. (Project Syndicate) — Concern about the proliferation of disinformation, misinformation and propaganda has reached the point where many governments are proposing new legislation and regulation.",
  "But there are also plenty of bad actors “gaming” online information systems to promote extreme views and inaccurate information, lending them the appearance of mainstream popularity and acceptance.",
  "This has its benefits, but it also carries serious risks — beginning with the loss of journalistic standards of excellence, like those typically enforced within established media organizations.",
  "But while these legislative interventions all target digital platforms, they often fail to account for at least six ways in which today’s disinformation and propaganda differ from yesterday’s.",
  "Despite the U.S. campaign-ad controversies gathering steam over the past few weeks, neither platform is believed to have consulted leading experts, instead seeking to solve problems in-house.",
  "This obscures potential conflicts of interest, creates plausible deniability for state actors intervening in foreign information environments, and creates fertile ground for bots to thrive.",
