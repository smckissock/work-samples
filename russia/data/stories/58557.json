  "The testimony, from a closed interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee in August 2017, revealed that when a committee investigator asked Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, whether he had ever tried to assess the credibility of the dossier author’s sources, his lawyer explained that he could not answer that question.",
  "If he can answer generally without identifying the sources, I’d ask him to answer.”\n\nLevy responded, “He’s given you over nine hours of information and he’s going to decline to answer this one question.”\n\nFeinstein made the decision to release the transcript to clear up what she said was misinformation about his interview.",
