  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now with more reaction to opening monologue, the author of the bestselling book, 'Trumped Up: How Criminalization and Political Differences Endangers Democracy', Professor Alan Dershowitz, and former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova -- two of the smartest lawyers in the country.",
  "Look, he had John Radcliffe in the House Judiciary Committee point blank, when did you make this decision, only to find out later, months later, the revelation that they started writing this exoneration months before Director Comey actually stood up in July of 2016 and said, you know, we don't find anything there there.",
  "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR: I have to tell you, if after a year of very thorough investigation and going after all the low- hanging fruit and getting people not only to sing but some of them even perhaps to compose, if they couldn't have shifted him from a subject to a target, there's nothing there.",
  "Imagine if Robert Mueller and his team of Democratic donors weren't carrying out their never ending witch-hunt, don't you think the president's poll numbers would be a lot higher if a majority of the country wasn't being fed an endless stream of outright lies, propaganda, distortion and misinformation?",
  "And if Bob Mueller wants to take the president of the United States who is not involved in any of the 19 charges that he has brought thus far, into a court over testimony, I think that that is -- would be one of the most disgraceful periods in American history.",
  "JOE CONCHA, REPORTER AND COLUMNIST, THE HILL: First ladies rarely get attacked whether it be Michelle Obama, whether it be a Bush, whether it be- -\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Michelle Obama when she said for the first time in my adult life I'm proud of my country.",
  "What we are seeing now is conduct by two public officials, Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein that is unethical, unprofessional, an embarrassment to the United States government and is undermining equal enforcement of the law --\n\nHANNITY: Oh, there's no doubt.",
  "Without those documents there never would have been a Nunes memo and wouldn't have known about any of the massive scandals we are talking about every night unfolding like the FISA abuse, lying to judges to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate.",
  "And Jason Chaffetz, Congressman Chaffetz, he has a list of the top 10 things Congress should be doing right now so that they will serve you the American people, the supposed to be public servants, and it would help Republicans in the end actually win.",
  "Remember the Heritage foundation they did a study the president's first year, they found he has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, which by the way, is higher than Ronald Reagan's 49 percent at the same time in his presidency.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, D, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day that goes by, more evidence, more proof about, you know, fake news and the Russians and Cambridge Analytica and, you know, misogyny and sexism.",
  "They should give states the opportunity to vote on whether Congress should be subject to balancing the federal budget and finally the Senate should refuse to recess until every single one of the president's appointees have been voted on.",
  "But I look at all of this, did you ever heard of an FBI director taking a case away from a field office, putting it in a special category and writing an exoneration months before you investigate or talk to the key witnesses in the case?",
  "And I read this and I am saying why wouldn't they, especially in light of everything that I just laid out that the president is doing, troops to the border, is he helping on healthcare, is he going to go back to the omnibus bill.",
  "The commander-in-chief is now following through on his tough talk about securing the southern border and earlier today, he signed a proclamation to immediately deploy the National Guard to help enforce America's immigration laws.",
  "One of the things I put on my list of 10 is that they should actually bring up and they should have Director Mueller and Rod Rosenstein testify before the House --\n\nHANNITY: Do you think Rod Rosenstein belongs in his position?",
  "And until Republicans, who have been given the mantel of power, they were elected and put into office to get things done, until they actually play offense, guess what, they're just going to be on the receiving end of attacks.",
  "But your bigger question is whether the Roseanne success is going to call Hollywood to rethink its assumptions towards conservatism and toward Donald Trump, hardly 90 percent of Hollywood's political money goes to the left.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: They know it, but they hope that by investigating collusion, they'll get somebody to obstruct justice, to commit perjury, to commit one of these other peripheral crimes, as they always say it's in the cover-up.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The non-target letter isn't worth the paper that it's printed on, because the prosecutor can just decide two days after he writes the letter that he wants to -- now he has made up his mind to charge you.",
  "The president, he deserves a lot of credit because if Congress -- if they're not going to lift a finger to solve the problem, then he is going to take the steps as commander-in-chief and do it on his own, which he now has.",

  "Remember, Rosenstein is the guy that ran in to Paul Ryan's office back in January at the last hour, begging Speaker Ryan to block Congressman Nunes' request for documents about all the FISA abuses in the dossier.",
  "PHILIP MUDD, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL: If someone walked into my office and said I was the subject of a multiyear criminal investigation led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, I'd wet my pants.",
  "If they would repeal Obamacare, like they said they would, and the president has a great idea with the associations, why do I believe that's good politics and everybody is worried about the blue wave in 2018?",
  "What I would suggest and the president should -- might consider this is if he is asked a question why did you fire Comey, his answer is you're not allowed to ask me or question any article 2 decision I make.",
  "That's how ridiculous this entire process is, and Nunes is now requesting the DOJ do their job and, of course, Congress has their jobs, we have checks and balances, we have co-equal branches of government.",
  "Here's what's going to happen if Republicans don't keep their promises -- Democrats are going to try to systematically undo every single one of those accomplishments, we will put them back on the screen.",
  "HANNITY: I want to ask--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: By the way, I want to say something about this notion that Mueller wants to question the president.",
  "They are too busy orchestrating an onslaught of any negative story that they can possibly find obsessing over, oh, Stormy Daniels and Trump-Russia collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia, that doesn't exist.",
  "HANNITY: See, if they would too these simple things, if they would fully fund the border wall and begin the construction, the money is there -- and I still think the president can get it from the DOD.",
  "The president is also taking a big step -- this is amazing, nobody ever reports it -- to make healthcare more affordable for everybody and getting around some of the devastating ObamaCare mandates.",
  "In other words, I've got to believe that James Comey is in a heap of trouble between leaking this information that he had -- that was supposed to be confidential and privileged with the president.",
  "Before the liberal media, all you leftists out there, start losing your collective minds over the National Guard being deployed at the southern border, with all due respect, we will educate you.",
  "Nunes is blasting the repeated stonewalling by the Department of Justice which is being led by Rosenstein and refusing continually to hand over documents that have been subpoenaed by Congress.",
  "It's that prosecutors induce cover-ups, which is why innocent people shouldn't be testifying unless they absolutely have to because you can be indicted for perjury even if you tell the truth.",
  "GORKA: Sean, not only did she steal the primary from Uncle Bernie, the fact is she was facilitating the most successful Russian information operation in the history of the Russian nation.",
  "And now, we are told that Mueller wants to interview the president of the United States who knows nothing, who has been a witness to nothing, who is not a target of the investigation.",
  "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, let's say, this first of all, about Rod Rosenstein -- his conduct from the beginning of this has been a disgrace legally and every other way.",
  "Not to mention, by the way, this is something the media refusing to accept, as constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz is explaining -- oh, this is rough for the media to handle.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT: We went through a long period where people talked about collusion as if there was some federal crime called collusion.",
  "That's they're beside themselves over reports that President Trump is not currently -- oh, let me repeat, not a target of the special counsel Robert Mueller's corrupt investigation.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: That's right, because if somebody contradicts you, and the prosecutor believes the person contradicting you, you are indicted for perjury even though you told the truth.",
  "So, why was it good enough to present to the court, but now that there is a President-elect Trump and a President Trump coming into office, suddenly, he is making excuses for it.",
  "And considering how polarized this country is and considering how overwhelming the media coverage is to jump five points over all those polls--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: That's big.",
  "Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz -- now, he is going to join news a few minutes -- he's out with a list 10 things that Congress should be doing right now.",
  "This includes ongoing counter narcotic missions, infrastructure construction, persistent surveillance, operations training and aerial support throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: Well, but still, they made a mistake and I think they paid a heavy consequence for it I think the Democrats would pay a heavy cost if they made the same mistake.",

  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: And tonight, we have learned that President Trump has signed the proclamation to send the National Guard to the southern border.",
  "This is good news, by the way, for the media to be so successful in their attacks against Trump, they are kind of cheering against the country succeeding.",
  "Because he didn't want to make the tough decisions you would have to make if you were supervising a case being run by a United States attorney like Huber.",
  "He is absolutely right that they have deprived the right of the president of the opportunity to govern but the Republicans did the same thing to Clinton.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (muted)\n\nCOOPER: Rich, do you have an example of any (muted) country that the president referred to that is predominantly Caucasian?",
  "This is an abomination and violation--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: And even it means a yearlong fight over executive privilege that battle should be waged?",
  "And I think that actually what we're seeing now is Donald Trump, the President, and Melania Trump, they are being made to being sympathetic figures.",
