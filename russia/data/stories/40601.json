  "If you prefer ridgelines to tan lines and like to soak up scenery rather than sun, there are few better ways to show your allegiance to Team Mountain than heading to Luray, Va. Tucked into the Shenandoah Valley, it’s the kind of place where you want to plant yourself on the front porch and drag out your morning coffee until lunchtime.",
  "Luray is a great home base for exploring Shenandoah National Park, with the multitudinous outdoor ad­ven­ture and scenic-vista-ogling options the 200,000-acre park offers — whether it be hiking through a panorama of fall leaves or sitting in a line of cars stopped to let a bear cub amble across Skyline Drive.",
  "The sleepy county seat is largely free of commercial trappings, save for the touristy atoll that is Luray Caverns, a geological attraction that’s equal parts natural wonder and kitsch (e.g., the Great Stalacpipe Organ).",
  "The small town has a gently rolling main drag presided over by the Mimslyn Inn, an Old South-style hotel that sits atop a hill at one end.",
  "Skyline Caverns, a relatively gritty alternative, is also along the route from the District.",
