  "“Following this initial meeting, Novartis determined that Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to U.S. health care policy matters and the decision was taken not to engage further,” the company said, adding that it couldn't terminate the contract “for cause.”\n\nAs Popehat notes, though, companies will usually give themselves cover in such situation so they can recoup their investments.",
  "As Boburg and Davis write rather charitably, “From outward appearances, Cohen seems an unusual choice to advise a South Korean aviation company on U.S. government accounting standards.”\n\nAs an expert explained, it's possible Cohen might have farmed out the work to an expert.",
  "https://t.co/WO5QLRsti8 — Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) May 9, 2018\n\nSeriously, I'm not as offended about Novartis' banal old-hat pay-to-play corruption as I am about their public statements about it, which treat us all like we're total morons.",
  "And then there's the arrangement with a company affiliated with a Vladimir Putin-aligned Russian oligarch whose ties to Russia Cohen must have known about, given he reportedly was seen with the oligarch at Trump's inauguration.",
  "He was also hired “to provide insights into understanding the new administration” by telecommunications giant AT&T — despite never having served in the administration and not technically being a part of the Trump campaign.",
  "As The Post's Shawn Boburg and Aaron C. Davis write, Cohen was paid $150,000 by the South Korean company during a time it was facing a major corruption scandal but also seeking a big defense contract in the United States.",
  "Former aides and lawmakers are regularly hired to lobby and consult on an array of issues once they leave their government jobs, with the perhaps unspoken understanding that they can influence their former colleagues.",
  "As a new report by The Washington Post's t looks a whole lot as though access was being sold, though it's unclear how explicitly and whether it was provided or official decisions affected.",
  "But exactly how this company stumbled upon Cohen's fledgling consulting business and hired him to work on something that is clearly not his specialty is the huge, unanswered question.",
  "The company has said it hired Cohen's Essential Consultants to help it on “health care policy matters.” But it said in a statement Wednesday that it didn't get much for its money.",
  "“In fact, we are somewhat perplexed by these alleged connections that surfaced recently,” said Oh Sung-keun, deputy senior manager in the company’s public relations department.",
  "The most amazing thing that happened that day is former personal injury lawyer Michael Cohen suddenly becoming an expert on accounting, health care and telecommunications.",
  "The explanation there: The company, Columbus Nova, was seeking “potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.”\n\nHealth care.",
  "In total, The Post has confirmed Cohen was paid at least $2.35 million, the lion's share of which was for work on which he had no apparent expertise.",
  "The stated reason for Cohen's work: Advice on “cost accounting standards,” a highly technical set of rules involved in seeking government contracts.",
  "Till that moment, Cohen was better known as Trump's personal lawyer and “fixer,” as well as an aspiring real estate mogul and taxi baron.",
  "And whether the disclosures ultimately matter in Cohen's criminal case, at least we're getting a window into how Washington works.",
  "The most puzzling arrangement we've become aware of is Cohen's $1.2 million in payments from the pharmaceutical company Novartis.",
  "Just as remarkably, the company claims it didn't even know about Essential Consultants' relationship with Trump.",
  "But after Trump was elected, Cohen landed lucrative contracts to help companies navigate the new administration.",
  "— StoleMyLookHat (@Popehat) May 9, 2018\n\nAnother questionable arrangement was Cohen's work for Korea Aerospace.",
  "What's as remarkable as how much business he got is the range of activities for which he was apparently hired.",
  "If the swamp was being drained by Trump, his personal lawyer seemed to be wading in it as long as he could.",
  "Novartis is saying it paid Michael Cohen $1.2 Million dollars for a single meeting that produced nothing?",
  "But at least those aides and lawmakers may have worked on those issues and/or know how government works.",
  "The most amazing thing that happened on Nov. 8, 2016, is no longer Donald Trump winning the presidency.",
  "And it committed to paying him the money without any understanding of his ability to perform?",
  "How they would have paid Cohen so much without an ability to get it back seems ... odd.",
  "About the only thing Cohen seemed to offer on these issues was his proximity to Trump.",
  "Cohen's newfound expertise was not limited to health care and accounting, though.",
  "These are just not mistakes that large companies with armies of lawyers make.",
  "Cohen, it seems, had become a real Renaissance man almost overnight.",
  "None of this is hugely surprising or even illegal.",
  "Telecommunications.",
  "Investments.",
  "Accounting."
