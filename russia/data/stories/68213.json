  "Cohen’s statement of the offense describes lying about the Trump Tower deal to “give the false impression the Moscow Project ended before ‘the Iowa caucus and … the very first primary,’ in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigation.”\n\nAt least for the purposes of Don Jr.’s congressional appearance (the only public transcript of an investigative interview that addresses the topic), that effort to mislead had its desired effect.",
  "Don Jr.’s claims that there was no follow-up to the June 2016 meeting with the Russians are also belied by later testimony and documentary evidence provided to the same Senate committee, which showed that the intermediary who set up the meeting, Rob Goldstone, made extensive efforts to set up a second meeting after Trump won and probably had direct contact with the president’s son in doing so.",
  "He claimed to be “peripherally aware” of the negotiations, but said he did not know of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s outreach to the Kremlin seeking President Vladimir Putin’s help on the deal until that news had been reported by the press.",
  "In a letter to the congressional intelligence committees sent in August 2017, Cohen had falsely contended that he “did not brief [the elder Donald Trump] or any of his family” on the Moscow deal, save for three briefings to Trump himself.",
  "For example, contrary to his claim that no other foreign nationals offered or provided assistance to the Trump presidential campaign (as the Russians had done), a group from the Middle East ?",
  "But the substance of Cohen’s new plea suggests Don Jr.’s exposure may extend well beyond the perjury charges that Trump advisers reportedly worry he could face for lying to Congress.",
  "By sending his letter to the intelligence committees last August, Cohen established his lies before Don Jr. testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, 2017.",
  "a conversation that mostly focused on the infamous June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting in which Russians were supposedly going to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton ?",
  "So Don Jr.’s claims to the committee regarding the Moscow project remain uncorrected, along with a number of other statements that we now know to be false.",
  "As his latest statement of the offense lays out, Cohen now says that he did brief Trump’s family members within the company about the project.",
  "Perhaps as a result, Judiciary Committee staffers didn’t challenge the claims by the president’s son that he knew very little about the deal.",
  "Don Jr.’s exposure may extend well beyond the perjury charges that Trump advisers reportedly worry he could face for lying to Congress.",
  "going back as far as August of this year and expressed more urgently in the wake of the midterm elections ?",
  "When Donald Trump Jr. was interviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in September of last year ?",
  "And The Wall Street Journal reported that Don Jr. was included on emails about the project.",
  "had offered social media manipulation services at another Trump Tower meeting he attended.",
  "Perhaps the president’s son was playing word games in sworn testimony to the Senate.",
  "But his claims seem inconsistent with a detail from Cohen’s latest plea agreement.",
  "he claimed to know “very little” about talks to establish a Trump Tower in Moscow.",
  "that Trump fears that special counsel Robert Mueller will seek to indict his son.",
  "The question is: How much did Don Jr. know about what Cohen was doing?",
  "including Israeli, Saudi and United Arab Emirate nationals ?",
  "This likely explains the multiple reports ?",
