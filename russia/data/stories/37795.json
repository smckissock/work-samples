  "Valeant received more bad news on February 29 when Moody’s Investors Service placed the company’s $31 billion of rated debt on review for downgrade, citing “significant business challenges to [the company’s] pricing strategy and aggressive acquisition appetite.” The Johnny-come-lately ratings agency added that “Valeant is confronting significant scrutiny on its pricing practices, including on products acquired through acquisitions, and uncertainty related to government investigations.” By Tuesday, March 1, Valeant bonds maturing in 2025 were trading at 81.13 cents on the dollar, down from 86.69 the previous Friday before the latest slew of bad news.",
  "It would appear the perennial bullishness in forward consensus numbers is so out of kilter with economic reality that companies are moving earlier to correct this anomaly to the extent the consensus growth forecast for this year is already fast approaching zero.”According to Mr. Lapthorne, “Global 2016 EPS forecasts were cut by 3.6% in over the last four weeks or so: we make that the worst monthly cuts to forward estimates since 2009.”\n\nAnother piece of bad news is rolling down the pike.",
  "The FASB’s Vice Chairman James Kroeker said with respect to long overdue passage of the new rule: “It puts things in a more transparent condition…[and] adds light to one of the last remaining crevasses of off-balance sheet accounting.” The question now is who is going to fall into those crevasses?5 Or whether those crevasses will be wide enough for all of those analysts who are going to tumble in ass-over-heels?",
  "There is no question that regulators are hot on the trail; the company finally disclosed on February 29 that it is under investigation by the SEC for undisclosed matters (apparently Philidor-related) separate and apart from a previously disclosed SEC inquiry into accounting and inventory issues at Salix Pharmaceuticals, which it acquired for $11 billion last year.",
  "The Financial Accounting Board (FASB), which moves slower than a tortoise crossing the road, finally adopted a rule last week that was ten years in the making that will require U.S. companies to add to their balance sheets lease and other debt-like obligations whose disclosures were previously limited to footnotes in their financial statements.",
  "The business model that attracted so much “smart money” (see “The Idiocy of Crowds” above) is no longer viable; Valeant’s damaged reputation, battered stock and bond prices, and tough market and political conditions render it impossible for Valeant to make additional acquisitions or to keep raising drug prices to the extent it did before.",
  "The Un-Valeant\n\nIf you want to know how investment disasters like Valeant Pharmaceuticals occur, the type of phony financial reporting described above is a good place to start looking (failing to disclose its corrupt relationship with mail-order pharmacy Philidor Rx Services didn’t hurt either).",
  "As the architect of Valeant’s toxic business model of borrowing heavily to acquire other health care companies in order to fire their workers, raise their drug prices and minimize research and development on new drugs, Mr. Pearson should never be permitted back on the premises again.",
  "The question now is whether it is too late for investors in the hedge funds that own this disaster to submit their redemption notices for March or whether they will have to wait for June to cut their losses (which were entirely foreseeable had their managers been doing their jobs).",
  "Valeant stock finished the month of February by dropping another 18.41% ($14.85 per share) to $65.80 per share after investors learned about the second SEC investigation, the Moody’s review and Mr. Pearson’s return (which some Wall Street sycophants tried to sell as a positive).",
  "In late January, journalist Stephen Witt disclosed the depths of the corruption involved in the company’s relationship with Philidor in an article in New York magazine that suggests that Mr. Pearson and the rest of his management team should be fitted for orange jumpsuits.",
  "While investors wait for all of these shoes to drop, the company announced on February 28 (when it announced Mr. Pearson’s return) that it will postpone its fourth quarter results and conference call with investors and withdraw its financial guidance for 2016.",
  "The differences between earnings calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the “pro forma” (which is Latin for “bullshit”) earnings that companies foist on an all-too-willing-to-believe investor class are obscenely large.",
  "Some hedge funds (you know who they are) bought more stock over the past few weeks when the greater part of valor was to cut their losses, a decision they are likely to regret even more than their original decision to fall for Mr. Pearson’s hocus-pocus.",
  "According to some estimates, corporations will have to add as much as $2 trillion of debt to their balance sheets under the new rule, which comes into effect in 2019 (God forbid we shouldn’t wait another three years for reality to set in!).",
  "The Web site Zerohedge, which remains a beacon of light (and humor) in a bleak financial media landscape, did its own analysis of the spread between GAAP and non-GAAP (“pro forma”) earnings to illustrate just how wide the gap has become.",
  "Eliminating all of the “pro forma” adjustments that companies use to distort their true financial condition from IBES GAAP earnings produced only $91 in earnings for the S&P 500 for the last 12 months compared to the $118 GAAP figure.",
  "Probes Reporter published a report on February 23 warning of a second undisclosed SEC investigation of Valeant that was confirmed by the SEC in a letter dated February 22, 2016 that was received by the research site on February 27.",
  "Previously, corporations were allowed to omit from the liability side of their balance sheets their lease obligations for real estate, airplanes, office equipment and other assets vital to the operation of their businesses.",
  "It appears that this disclosure was forced by an inquiry by John Gavin at Probes Reporter, an independent research firm that files Freedom of Information Act requests to push the SEC to acknowledge company investigations.",
  "Private equity-owned companies are among the biggest abusers of accounting conventions, a skill some of them like Apollo Global Management, LLC carried over to their negotiation (or violation) of debt covenants.",
  "But other data such as the performance of high yield bond borrowers refutes them; earnings are weak not just in the energy and energy-related sectors but in retail, media, consumer products and other areas.",
  "The collective intellectual capital of the “buy side” (which should be called the “dark side”) blithely ignores the fact that reported earnings are as genuine as the eructations of political candidates.",
  "If the facts in that article are true (the reporting appeared to be exemplary), the company and its executives could face criminal and will almost certainly face civil securities fraud charges.",
  "Back here on Planet Earth, where cash flow is all that stands between companies and bankruptcy court, S&P 500 GAAP earnings fell by 12.7% in 2015 according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
  "But Valeant is just illustrative of the type of company that hedge funds, activist investors and others feted in the financial press tend to flock to like flies on feces.",
  "Whilst similar effects occurred last year, this is somewhat of a departure from the past when year-ahead forecasts tended to be cut steadily throughout the year.",
  "The board is making a serious mistake, and based on what happened on his first couple of days back at the office, Mr. Pearson probably wishes he stayed home.",
  "Valeant’s financials are a case study in “pro forma” reporting due to its serial acquisitions and wholesale dedication to pimping the hedge fund community.",
  "While any financial analyst of minimal competence could dig out these figures, the fact that GAAP permitted these figures to be obfuscated was ridiculous.",
  "As Societe Generale’s Andrew Lapthorne pointed out last week, “Fourth quarter reporting season is leading to significant cuts to 2016 expectations.",
  "As a result, the company has to figure out how to service and ultimately repay $31 billion of debt in increasingly inhospitable credit markets.",
  "When I mention this to friends of the bullish persuasion, they dismiss this concern by attributing the earnings weakness to the energy sector.",
  "And tech companies competed for the top of the fantasy league with $175 billion of GAAP earnings versus $218 billion of “pro forma” earnings.",
  "While half the trick of investing is figuring out what the consensus thinks, the wisdom of crowds is a myth when it comes to the markets.",
  "This is consistent with the huge gaps between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in materials, health care and technology discussed above.",
  "Speaking of Valeant, the board decided to allow Chairman J. Michael Pearson to return to work this week after a medical leave.",
  "The financial statements of energy companies – particularly highly leveraged ones – are also filled with “pro forma” nonsense.",
  "This is particularly true since there is increasing evidence that he lied to investors and his own directors about Philidor.",
  "It is one of the marvels of modern markets how they seem to depend on the deliberate suspension of disbelief to stay afloat.",
  "The fact that some funds invested as much as 20%-30% of their capital in this company was extraordinarily reckless.",
  "Health care companies chimed in with $104 billion of GAAP earnings versus $157 billion of “pro forma” earnings.",
  "In 2015, materials companies reported $13 billion of GAAP earnings versus $30 billion of “pro forma” earnings.",
  "Overall, 2015 S&P 500 GAAP earnings were $787 billion compared to $1.04 trillion of “pro forma” earnings.",
  "The S&P 500 is now trading at roughly 17x reported earnings but at more than 21x GAAP earnings.",
  "Naturally, S&P 500 companies reported “pro forma” year-over-year earnings growth of 0.4%.",
  "There was some other bad news about a couple of the company’s products, but why pile on?",
  "Valeant should have disclosed this second inquiry earlier to investors.",
  "But the GAAP figure was the worst since the 2008 financial crisis.",
  "In other words, 22.4% of non-GAAP earnings are questionable.",
  "---\n\nExcerpted from March issue of the Credit Strategist.",
  "Financial markets are where rules go to be broken.",
  "Looking forward doesn’t lift the dark cloud.",
  "Either measure does not qualify as cheap."
