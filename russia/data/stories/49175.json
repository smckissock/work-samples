  "There isn’t an item description for this law firm, for the amount of money that is being alleged to be given to this research firm.”\n\nTurley noted that it is possible that the money could have come from an outside donor and noted that “there is a $66,000 research item that was mentioned, but there’s no reference to it.”\n\nTurley also answered a question about Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Trump’s campaign, reaching out to WikiLeaks to help release Hillary Clinton’s emails by stating he doesn’t “see the crime there.” He continued that while hacking systems is a crime, and some of the information in Clinton’s emails was found to be classified, it’s not necessarily illegal to see if that sort of information will become “publicly available or available otherwise.",

  "And in the same sense, it wouldn’t be a crime to receive information on Trump side from a foreign national.",
  "In the same way, the allegation over the dossier does involve a potential violation of federal law.",
  "I’ve been cautioning, and many others have, that it really isn’t a crime to collude.",
  "But the allegation against the Clintons could potentially be criminal.",
  "The $500,000 given to Bill Clinton might have been innocent.",
  "But that would be a cognizable crime if a linkage was found.",
  "The timing just might have been horrible.",
  "It doesn’t mean that they are criminal."
