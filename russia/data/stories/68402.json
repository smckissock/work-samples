  "Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich's sale of company shares only three months before the chipmaker disclosed security flaws could invite scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to experts.",

  "Since then, two U.S. lawmakers -- Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, and Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican -- have asked federal regulators to open an investigation into the stock sales.",
  "But in June last year -- months before Krzanich's latest sale -- cybersecurity experts informed Intel about vulnerabilities that would enable hackers to gain access to chips made by Intel and others.",
  "And Krzanich promised fixes in the coming week to 90 percent of the processors Intel has made in the past five years, consistent with an earlier statement from the company.",
  "Krzanich opened his keynote talk Monday night at the annual CES gadget show in Las Vegas by addressing the hard-to-fix flaws disclosed by security researchers last week.",
  "Though the financial impact on Intel likely will be \"limited,\" the security flaws will be a \"black eye\" to the chipmaker, according to Raymond James analyst Chris Caso.",

  "\"I think his goose is cooked quite frankly, given how long the information was in the organization and his proximity to the information.\"",
  "The average computer user likely won't notice any significant change in performance after installing the patches, according to Intel.",
  "With other types of vulnerabilities, we have learned of past exploitation after vulnerabilities had been publicly disclosed.\"",
  "But Intel has pushed back against that idea, arguing that the problems can be \"mitigated\" by software or firmware upgrades.",
  "Some researchers have argued that the flaws reflect a fundamental hardware defect that can't be fixed short of a recall.",
