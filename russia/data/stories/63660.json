  "MURRAY: Well, we went back to them today amid the continuing controversy and instead of weighing in again, Jared Kushner's team just referred us back to that statement from Kushner's lawyer from last week.",
  "So, that too just -- you're talking about Sean Spicer, that also flies in the face of what Sean Spicer said today, that this is only about adoptions and there's no reason to believe it was anything else.",
  "And increasingly since then, there's been an interest in, you know, American shoppers knowing their clothes aren't being made in exploited conditions, that their workers are being treated the right way.",

  "(END AUDIO CLIP) COOPER: So, Sean Spicer is saying that there was not that would lead\n\n\n\nanyone to believe that the meeting was for any other purpose and to discuss Russian adoptions and sanctions.",
  "COOPER: What I don't understand about this is I talked to the attorney for the Agalarov family early last week, and he never mentioned that there was a representative for the family at the meeting.",
  "So, it seems unlikely right now that there are some sort of a rabbit that Mitch McConnell can pull out of a hat to try and perform some sort of a magic act to try and get this bill back on track.",
  "David, I mean, again, how big of a problem is it for the White House to have Sean Spicer come out and say basically just sort of ignoring all the facts that have been revealed over the last week.",
  "WYDEN: My sense is we have so many different versions of the stories and then they come back and somehow try to find a path to correct it, and it short of reminds me of lather, rinse and repeat.",
  "That answer, it ignores the chain of e-mails that Donald Trump Jr. himself released under pressure saying the meeting was about information on Hillary Clinton provided by the Russian government.",
  "QUINN: You know what's a serious point, is that either the Trump White House thinks they can now switch gears from lying to not lying to lying again and America's is just going to stand for it.",

  "To the members of this committee, any threat or effort to interfere with our elections from any nation state, or any non-state actor, is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know.",

  "You remember, two Saturdays since the news first broke that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer last year.",
  "But for Sean Spicer just point blank saying there's no evidence that this had anything to do with anything other than adoptions, when we all have seen the e- mails.",
