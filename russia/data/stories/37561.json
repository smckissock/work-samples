  "The 29-room Playboy Mansion, which gained notoriety over the years for the extravagant parties that have been hosted on its grounds, features a wine cellar, home theater, separate game house, gym, tennis court, separate four-bedroom guesthouse, official zoo license, and a freeform swimming pool with the famous cave-like grotto, according to the listing.",
  "A representative for Metropoulos told Forbes earlier this week that once Hefner’s tenancy ends and the sale closes—which is a condition of the deal—the new owner plans on joining his current estate with the Playboy Mansion to create the 7.3-acre compound that the architect of both properties, Arthur R. Kelly, originally envisioned.",
  "The younger Metropoulos also happens to own the adjacent Holmby Hills property—a 7,300-square-foot English Manor-style house that he bought from longtime Playboy Mansion resident Hugh Hefner and his former wife Kimberly Conrad in 2009 for $18 million.",
  "In particular, he renovated the formal gardens and expansive grounds that sit adjacent to the Los Angeles Country Club and include the original gate that connects to the Playboy Mansion.",
  "The newspaper said the current record was set in 2014, when the 50,000-square-foot Westside mansion Fleur de Lys went for $102 million, a price that included artwork and furnishings.",
  "As reported earlier this week, buyer Daren Metropoulos is the son of billionaire private equity mogul C. Dean Metropoulos, whose net worth FORBES pegs at $2.4 billion.",
  "The estate, which has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, served as the personal residence to Hefner and his since-divorced wife before being sold to Metropoulos.",
  "Daren Metropoulos, the son of billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos, looks to have gotten a relative \"deal\" in his agreement to buy the Playboy Mansion.",
  "The mansion was put on the market six months ago for $200 million—one of the highest asking prices for a private residence in the United States.",
  "Since buying the 1927 Gothic Tudor home adjacent to the Playboy Mansion, Daren Metropoulos has made significant restorations to the property.",
  "The Playboy Mansion, though famously known as the home of Hefner, is technically not owned by the man, but rather Playboy Enterprises.",
  "Even at the lower-than-asked-for price, the transaction will be the most expensive home sale ever recorded in Los Angeles County .",
  "The newspaper also says that the initial $200 million asking price may have been nothing more than a publicity stunt.",
  "Former playmates told Realtor.com that the once pristine estate is decrepit and marked by a strong smell of urine.",
  "As of late, however, the mansion—like the magazine with which it shares its name—has fallen on tougher times.",
  "But it's being sold for about half of its listed price, or $105 million, according to The Los Angeles Times.",
  "The billionaire co-owns Hostess, the maker of Twinkies, with private equity firm Apollo Global Management.",
  "Over the years, he has bought, turned around and sold brands from Chef Boyardee to Pam cooking spray.",
  "A representative for Daren Metropoulos did not respond to a request for comment about the price.",
  "An unnamed source told the L.A. Times the sale price."
