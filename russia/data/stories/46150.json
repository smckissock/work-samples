  "and other committee leaders — as well as leaders in the U.K. and Europe — have asked for answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London alleged that the data, which included Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users obtained without their permission, was used to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.",
  "More: Cambridge Analytica board suspends CEO pending probe into misuse of Facebook user data\n\n\"Consumers have a right to know how their information is used — and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,\" Schneiderman, New York's Attorney General, said in a statement.",
  "On Tuesday, EPIC, the Center for Digital Democracy and a coalition of consumer groups sent a letter urging the FTC to investigate a violation of the consent decree that states Facebook must get consumers' permission before changing the way it shares data and before enacting changes that \"override their privacy preferences.\"",
  "\"It’s long overdue that lawmakers from both parties stopped giving Facebook and the other commercial digital ad companies a free 'collect all our data' pass with our personal information,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a longtime critic of Facebook.",

  "The FTC is looking into whether the incident is a violation of a 2011 consent decree giving privacy protections to Facebook users' data, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, also citing a person familiar with the situation.",
  "Cambridge Analytics, which provided services to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, got the user data from Global Science Research, which collected the data from a personality quiz app accessed through Facebook.",
  "But Cambridge Analytica still has most of the data, according to the report in The New York Times, and 30 million of the profiles had enough information to match users to other records and build profiles of them.",
  "The social media giant said Friday it suspended Cambridge Analytica from operating on its platforms as it investigated whether it failed to delete information it received through an academic researcher.",
  "The move was the latest by the huge social network to respond to concerns that it and other online platforms have hurt news organizations by dominating internet advertising.",
  "Facebook is also being investigated by New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Healey, who said they sent a demand letter Tuesday.",

  "Privacy activists called for the federal watchdog to investigate whether the improper handling of Facebook users' data violated a consent decree with the FTC.",
  "And Facebook officials met with U.S. lawmakers Tuesday and are scheduled to meet with them again Wednesday to brief them on Cambridge Analytica.",
  "“We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,\" said an FTC statement sent to USA TODAY.",
  "\"We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.”\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
  "Facebook on February 27, 2018 announced a $3 million pilot project aimed at helping US newspapers boost paid digital subscriptions.",
  "It is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented disclosure of Americans’ personal data to occur,\" the letter said.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost almost $5 billion as the company's market cap fell more than $36 billion to $501.3 billion.",
  "Today, @MassAGO Healey and I sent a letter to Facebook demanding more information regarding Cambridge Analytica.",
  "\"The FTC has an obligation to the American public to ensure that companies comply with existing consent orders.",
  "The data was supposed to destroyed, but was passed on to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook’s rules.",
  "But the FTC failed to enforce the order and we now live with the consequences,\" Rotenberg said.",
  "Shares fell nearly 7% on Monday, the stock's worst drop in four years, according to FactSet.",
  "Concerns about the situation led to a continued decline in Facebook's stock price Tuesday.",
  "It is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.",
  "\"EPIC and many consumer privacy organizations worked hard to get that order in place.",
  "The agency would not confirm that an investigation was underway.",
