  "Ulmer published an article in the Times, in June, 2005, that described Bannon as a “Roman Catholic filmmaker, conservative-film financier, Washington networker and Hollywood deal-chaser,” who was “emblematic of a new wave in Hollywood, a group that intends to clean those media pipes with pictures that promote godliness, Pax Americana, and its own view of family values.” “You’re overthinking this.” The two men had a number of conversations in the spring of 2005, Ulmer said, and Bannon told him several times that he hoped to destroy the Hollywood establishment.",
  "Larry David, the show’s head writer and executive producer, told me, “I don’t think I ever heard of him until he surfaced with the Trump campaign and I had no idea that he was profiting from the work of industrious Jews!” Rob Reiner, one of the founders of Castle Rock, has said of Bannon’s profits from the show, “It makes me sick.” There were several companies involved in the deal: Turner Broadcasting Systems; Castle Rock; Sony, which owned a stake of about forty-four per cent in Castle Rock; and Westinghouse, with a fifteen-per-cent stake.",
  "Over footage of a young man wearing a fitted suit in a corporate office, Breitbart says, “When you go to Washington, D.C., and you meet with the conservative movement, it’s as if they’ve read the exact right books, taken the right tests, met the right people, are wearing the right outfits, wearing the right tie—and you almost feel like an outsider, even though you’re in the actual conservative movement.” Breitbart denounced mainstream Republicans’ dismissive treatment of Palin.",
  "Before 9/11, Watkins had planned to make a traditional documentary, but by the time he started working with Bannon, he said, “something ticked in us—that life is about good versus evil, and history repeats itself.” The film, called “In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed,” opens with archival footage from early-twentieth-century cataclysms—the First and Second World Wars, the Soviet labor camps and famine—and proceeds to Hollywood, where Reagan rose to prominence.",
  "“He has established a conservative film making studio at his headquarters in dc and is preparing to roll out an entire slate starting with the obama film.” A week later, he wrote again: “Do you think there is going to be any interest in the story as other people are starting to chase him but he obviously wants to see if you have an interest.” And the following week, after Ulmer said that he had proposed the story to editors at the Times, Bannon wrote, “Dude .",
  "a year after the acquisition, recalled about Bannon, “What I saw was a smart guy, who was funny and likable and enjoyable, who had a quick laugh, who was ineffectual.” Fennebresque described the years that Bannon and Vorse worked for SG Cowen, from 1998 to 2000, as “a high-octane time,” adding, “Anybody could make chicken salad out of chicken shit in that period.” Bannon “was one of those guys who always had big stuff about to happen,” he said.",
  "Throughout the film, a female narrator invokes “the Beast,” an authoritarian force that threatens “anything that elevated or empowered the individual.” The triumphal final scene shows the destruction of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, but it is followed by an ominous coda that warns of the dangers of Islamic radicalism, with militants hoisting rifles, and people falling to their deaths from the Twin Towers.",
  "Chris Bannon told Reider, “We had to secure the gate out front, get out with the federal marshals, serve the security person at the gate, secure the gate, and then move into the other critical areas that had already been defined in order to insure the safety and security of the Biosphere and its systems.” Several weeks earlier, the second team of biospherians had entered the sealed area.",
  "?” Referring to Alling, and to his upcoming testimony, he said, “On fucking April 1st, I kicked his ass, and I’m going to kick her ass on Thursday.” Bannon was preoccupied by Alling’s remark about the Challenger, and her general intransigence, saying over and over, “I am going to ram it down her fucking throat.” He went on, “She thinks she is a goddess, she thinks she is above us all.",
  "The film’s narrator praises the early studio bosses, “Jewish entrepreneurs,” who “differed in taste and style, yet shared two common elements: ruthlessness and uncompromising patriotism.” These men were not particularly kind to Reagan: “In the unforgiving calculus of the studio system, he was weighed, measured, and found wanting.” But a middling film career led to something greater.",
  "The Post said that the sale of PolyGram by its parent company, Royal Philips Electronics, in 1998, was “one of Bannon’s biggest deals.” Bannon told the Post that he brought in Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, of Saudi Arabia, as a possible bidder for PolyGram, and that although Seagram ultimately bought the company, the prospect of another bidder drove up the price by twenty per cent.",
  "He told me he would never use his own money again: “Because Steve was a Hollywood guy, I hoped there was going to be a great distribution program behind it, and there really wasn’t.” The first major profile of Steve Bannon appeared in Bloomberg Businessweek, in October, 2015, after he had become the chairman of the conservative Web site Breitbart News and moved to Washington.",
  "The woman later said, in a sworn divorce filing, that he screamed, “Crazy fucking cunt!” She complained to the officer about her sore neck, and he wrote, “I saw red marks on her left wrist and the right side of her neck.” Bannon was charged with spousal abuse, simple battery, and dissuading a witness, because he had made it impossible for his wife to talk to the police.",
  "By the early aughts, the former Hollywood colleague recalled, “he was sitting on Canon Drive, in his fabulous office, his bookshelves lined with military and history books, and he would take meetings all day with people, some of whom came to him for money for their movies.” Tim Watkins, the president of a small advertising company in Maryland, was one of those people.",
  "David Bossie produced two documentaries for the 2008 campaign season: “Hillary: The Movie” and “Hype: The Obama Effect.” The most damning review of the Hillary film came from the Federal Election Commission, which concluded that it was a piece of political propaganda, and that Citizens United’s marketing efforts should be subject to campaign-finance regulations.",
  "So here you have Sodom and Gomorrah bowing to the great Christian God.” Ulmer recalled, “I was watching him draw all these configurations and connecting lines about the Beast and Satan, and half of my brain was saying, ‘This guy’s a comic stitch,’ and the other, ‘He’s really off the deep end.’ ” Bannon seemed to have absorbed Bossie’s anger toward the Clintons.",
  "Bannon’s wife later said that his lawyer told her that, if Bannon went to jail, “I would have no money and no way to support the children.” Bannon, she said, told her that, if she went to court, “he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty.” Bannon and his attorney arranged for his wife and their daughters to leave town, she said.",
  "These days, Bannon is a dishevelled presence in the Oval Office, but he cut a different figure in Beverly Hills, where he looked the part of a Hollywood executive—fast-talking, smartly dressed, aggressively fit, carrying himself with what one former colleague described as an “alpha swagger.” He worked out of an impressive office on Canon Drive.",
  "“The people at the biosphere just treated huge amounts of money like it was petty cash,” Rebecca Reider quotes Bannon as saying in her 2009 book, “Dreaming the Biosphere.” Ultimately, Bass agreed, and he and Bannon concluded that the only solution was to seize Biosphere 2 from Allen’s management, and to install Bannon as the acting C.E.O.",
  "In Bannon’s court filing, he said that he did not want his children “attending a secular school,” and that, “based on my income, the expense of the proposed school is excessive.” On the income statement that Bannon submitted to the court, he wrote that his employer was Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consulting firm that he set up in 2005.",
  "During an interview at one of them, she wrote in a court filing, Bannon “asked the director why there were so many Chanukah books in the library.” After visiting another, “he asked me if it bothered me that the school used to be in a Temple.” Then, she went on, he “began a campaign of threatening every school to which I applied.",
  "Speaking about scientists who study climate change, Bannon added, “Many of them feel that the earth’s atmosphere in a hundred years is what Biosphere 2’s atmosphere is today.” ****Bannon went on to run Breitbart, which routinely describes climate science as fraudulent; his brother Chris remains on the staff of Biosphere 2.",
  "He worked hard to join the Hollywood establishment, and several people who knew him said that they were startled by his conversion to what one called “conservative political jihad.” Another said, “All the years I knew him, he just wanted to make a buck.”\n\nBannon was reared in an Irish Catholic family in Richmond, Virginia.",
  "I believe in the populist rebellion.” He added, “I make films of the highest artistic quality.” Bannon’s warnings about Islam had become even more dire since the making of “In the Face of Evil.” On the radio show, he said, “The left is starting to drumbeat an idea that we should have the rapprochement with radical Islam.",
  "That year, he released three documentaries: “Generation Zero,” which laid the blame for the financial crisis on the profligacy of liberal baby boomers; “Fire from the Heartland,” which showcased the women of the Tea Party, above all Michele Bachmann; and “Battle for America,” which rallied conservative voters.",
  "In the Times article, Ulmer said that Bannon had told him, “We’re the peasants with the pitchforks storming the lord’s manor.” Ulmer recalled, “He was always making these grand, hyperbolic analogies between good and evil, the culture of life versus the scourge of death that, in his view, Hollywood had become.",
  "But that was only after his ex-wife went to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, later that year, laid out Bannon’s history of having sabotaged her efforts to find a school, and said that she hadn’t notified him about the girls’ applications to Archer because she feared that he would do so again.",
  "I think she is a self-centered, deluded young woman, and she is about to get a reality check, and I am going to deliver it to her.” He added, “I am not about to have a twenty-nine-year-old bimbo criticize the people at this place for running something.” He also said, “But she’s going to pay.",
  "The police report said, “She asked him why he was playing these games with the money, and he said it was his money.” “Dad, when someone your age grows a beard it’s cultural appropriation.” After she threatened to divorce him, “[she] said he laughed at her, and said he would never move out.",
  "Last November, when Bannon was named Donald Trump’s chief White House strategist, many articles highlighted an extraordinary fact about his Hollywood career: that he had negotiated a profit participation in “Seinfeld” in 1993, two years before the show went into syndication.",
  "America needs an intervention, and the Tea Party is going to give it to them.” Bannon also started appearing regularly on Fox News, where Sean Hannity produced a special about “Generation Zero.” During this time, Bannon went through “a visible transformation,” a friend said.",
  "“Can I get a coffee and a relatable protagonist?” As the Bannon brothers knew, John Allen and several other members of the Biosphere 2 management were travelling in Japan, but two of them, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, returned as soon as they learned of the seizure.",
  "He said he doesn’t like Jews and that he doesn’t like the way they raise their kids to be whiney brats.” This account of Bannon’s comments about Jews and Archer has been widely reported, and Bannon’s supporters have dismissed them as the fabrications of an angry ex-wife.",

  "According to Ulmer’s recollection, Bannon told him that his Wellspring colleagues were his friends, even though they thought he was a reactionary and he thought they were “communists.” At Wellspring, former employees said that Bannon was an erratic manager.",
  "In 1991, Bannon hired Jones as a screenwriting partner, and their first project was an adaptation of “Titus,” which featured galactic travel and an episode of “ectoplasmic sex” between a “lower human” (a Moor in the original play) and a space queen.",
  "I certainly have not been raising the girls to be prejudice[d] against Jews or anyone else for that matter.” A spokesperson for Bannon said that he is not an anti-Semite, and pointed out that the girls went to Archer, and Bannon paid their tuition.",
