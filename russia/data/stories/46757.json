  "The company also blocked Wylie from accessing his Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp accounts\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Friday, Facebook said: \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\"",
  "Just after midday on Saturday, Christopher Wylie tweeted: \"Here we go...\" The 28-year-old data scientist was about to be catapulted into the international media glare after blowing the whistle on an enormous Facebook data breach, which he helped engineer.",

  "The Observer said Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition by the age of 17, while a year later he went to \"learn all things data\" from former US President Barack Obama's national director of targeting.",
  "She profiled him in an in-depth interview on Sunday , in which he detailed how he went from leaving school without a single qualification to being behind one of the biggest data breaches in Facebook's history.",

  "He was feeding her stories about work undertaken by data firm Cambridge Analytica both in the US for President Donald Trump's election team, but also in Britain during the EU referendum.",
  "He left school at the age of 16 without a single qualification to his name, but quickly found himself in the world of politics thanks to his understanding of the internet.",
  "Bannon eventually became Wylie's boss, and they teamed up with University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan's company, Global Science Research.",
  "During his studies, Wylie worked for British political party the Liberal Democrats on the side, helping \"upgrade their databases and voter targeting,\" he said.",
  "The \"intellectually ravenous\" gay vegan\n\nThe Observer's Cadwalladr describes Wylie as: \"Clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling.",
  "It was through his Lib Dem connections in 2013 that he was introduced to SCL Group, a subsidiary of which eventually went on to launch Cambridge Analytica.",
  "It remains to be seen if he is the millennials' first great whistleblower, but it was apt that his work was recognised by another famous whistleblower.",
  "\"All I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\" Wylie said about the letter he received from the company's lawyers.",

  "Wylie stepped into a world in which SCL Group was operating for the US and UK's defence departments at the frontline of information warfare.",

  "A digital native with no qualifications, just talent\n\nCadwalladr has hailed Wylie as \"the millennials' first great whistleblower.\"",

  "By 19, he had taught himself to code, and then at age 20, he moved to the UK to study law at the London School of Economics.",
  "Through this collaboration, they harvested Facebook data using a personality test app and went to work targeting US voters.",
  "Wylie grew up in British Columbia, Canada, and was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, according to The Observer.",

  "The Canadian had been acting as a source for Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr for more than a year.",

  "But after months of off-the-record conversations, Cadwalladr convinced Wylie to go public.",
  "Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 and made Facebook aware of the data breach in 2016.",
  "It had also deployed psychological operations tools during elections around the world.",
  "And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.",
  "That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie said.",
  "Wylie went public after speaking to a British journalist for a year.",
  "\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles.",
  "She called him \"the millennials' first great whistleblower.\"",
