  "Those efforts included using the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine — an alleged front group used by Manafort to route millions of dollars for covert lobbying work in Washington — and the so-called Hapsburg Group, a stable of former European politicians secretly paid to espouse positions in keeping with Yanukovych’s government.",
  "“The West is just a little more skillful at playing the modern game, where perception by the world public opinion and the spin is more important than what is actually going on,” Kilimnik wrote to Manafort in a December 2004 memo analyzing Russia’s bungled efforts to manipulate political events in former Soviet states.",
  "“Russia is ultimately going to lose if they do not learn how to play this game.”\n\nKilimnik — who special counsel Robert Mueller believes is currently in Russia and has ties to Russian intelligence — helped formulate Manafort’s pitches to clients in Russia and Ukraine, according to the records.",
  "Even after Manafort lost his campaign job and was indicted by Mueller on charges related to his foreign lobbying work, U.S. prosecutors alleged, Kilimnik helped ghost-write an op-ed defending Manafort under the name of Oleg Voloshyn, a former Ukrainian government official.",
  "But Kilimnik, an elusive figure now indicted alongside Manafort on witness tampering charges, was far more involved in formulating pro-Russia political strategy with Manafort than previously known, according to internal memos and other business records obtained by the AP.",
  "Deripaska has denied hiring Manafort for any pro-Russian political work, and unsuccessfully sued the AP last year over reporting that he had paid Manafort more than $10 million to influence political decisions and news coverage in Eastern Europe and Western capitals.",
  "A representative from the U.S. Embassy in Kiev would occasionally meet with Kilimnik to discuss current political affairs, according to a former senior U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.",
  "A new filing by the U.S. government in Manafort’s court cases showed that Manafort acknowledged that work in a 2014 FBI interview, and files seized by the FBI showed that Deripaska was the source of a $10 million loan to a Manafort-controlled company in 2010.",
  "More than a decade before Russia was accused of surreptitiously trying to tilt the presidential election toward Trump, Manafort and Kilimnik pondered the risks to Russia if the country did not hone its efforts to influence global politics, the records show.",
  "Kilimnik began that work in secret, the records show, even while working for the International Republican Institute — a U.S. government-funded nonprofit supporting the Western-friendly democratic movements that Manafort and his patrons sought to counter.",
  "The records do not reveal what motivated Kilimnik’s work for Manafort, though Mueller’s team has alleged in U.S. court filings that Kilimnik’s ties to Russian intelligence remained active through the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.",
  "Unofficially, it would be a propaganda operation intended to target Washington and European capitals and “train a cadre of leaders who can be relied upon in future governments,” according to one memo.",
  "At least some of Kilimnik’s channels to Deripaska remained open through the 2016 presidential campaign, when Kilimnik and Manafort sought to return to the oligarch’s good graces after a falling out.",
  "During the special counsel’s Russia investigation, Konstantin Kilimnik has been described as a fixer, translator or office manager to President Donald Trump’s ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
  "The records show Kilimnik helped conceive strategies that Manafort sold to clients, and that he served as a key liaison between Manafort and principal financial backers, including Deripaska.",
  "Among its greatest causes was Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, when street protests thwarted a clumsy attempt by a Russian-backed government to steal the country’s 2004 presidential election.",
  "In one memo, Kilimnik noted the failings of Soviet-style heavy-handed tactics, including Russia’s lack of experience with competitive elections after decades of one-party rule.",
  "The records include a rare 2006 photograph of Kilimnik, a Ukrainian native, in an office setting with Manafort and other key players in Manafort’s consulting firm at the time.",
  "By December 2004, he was already working for Manafort — not as a translator, as he told the New York Times earlier this year in a rare interview, but as a strategist.",
  "U.S. officials regarded Kilimnik as Manafort’s key aide during their work on behalf of pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych, who became the president of Ukraine in 2010.",
  "Days after Gates’ guilty plea, prosecutors said Kilimnik attempted to tamper with a witness by reaching out to a person connected with Manafort’s lobbying work.",
  "After a stint in the military, he joined the International Republican Institute as a translator in 1995 and rose to become the acting head of its Moscow office.",
  "Even before the Orange Revolution had run its course, Kilimnik had begun secretly working with Manafort to undermine it, the records obtained by the AP show.",
  "“Russian political consultants, skilled at manipulating virtual public opinion and achieving virtual results in virtual elections, were useless,” he wrote.",
  "Born in what was then Soviet Ukraine, Kilimnik was studying as a linguist at a state-run military university when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.",
  "Among Manafort’s clients were Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and other mega-wealthy Russians with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "A website was launched with some initial funding from the investment bank Rothschild, a Deripaska ally, but the project fizzled and folded.",
  "And as recently as April, Kilimnik contacted two witnesses in the Mueller investigation on behalf of Manafort, according to court filings.",
  "Other documents from the period identified Manafort’s client as Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with business ties to the Kremlin.",
  "Manafort proposed Kilimnik as the firm’s direct liaison with Deripaska’s main business, known as Basel, short for Basic Element.",
  "Other Manafort associates — including his deputy Rick Gates — have not shown the same steadfastness toward Manafort as Kilimnik.",
  "The records show that Kilimnik participated in an early Manafort plan to influence Western politicians and media outlets.",
  "From then on, he worked full time for Manafort, earning a base monthly salary of $10,000, according to the records.",
  "Deripaska has said he never received or discussed any proposal for new Manafort business during the campaign.",
  "The post-Soviet period was a heady time for the IRI, a nonprofit long headed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.",
  "Gates has pleaded guilty to helping Manafort launder millions of dollars through bank accounts in Cyprus.",
  "When the IRI learned in March 2005 that Kilimnik was working for Manafort, Kilimnik was abruptly fired.",
  "Officially, the project — known as Eurasia21 — would offer news and expertise on former Soviet states.",
  "Manafort also denied to the AP last year that he had performed political work for Deripaska.",
  "Some of the documents were later independently obtained by U.S. government investigators.",
  "This is Konstantin,” Kilimnik wrote via the WhatsApp messenger, according to the filings.",
  "But Deripaska hired Manafort’s firm — and Kilimnik became a key player in the work.",
  "“My friend is looking for ways to connect to you to pass you several messages.",
  "The plan was a model for covert lobbying work later by Manafort, however.",
  "Manafort also faces bank fraud and tax evasion charges in Virginia.",
  "Whether that occurred is not clear.",
  "Kilimnik has denied that.",
  "Can we arrange that?”",
  "“Hey."
