  "“But our commitment is to do it carefully and rigorously and tell people if those examples happen.”\n\nSandberg also took personal responsibility for the the series of crises Facebook has been embroiled in, saying that as the person looking over the company’s ad business she has not been let off the hook while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes all the blame.",
  "“So far, we don’t have another clear case to share.”\n\nThe recent Cambridge Analytica revelations, which were first reported by the Observer and the New York Times, have rocked Facebook, even though the company knew that the political consulting firm had wrongfully obtained the data in December 2015.",

  "On the things we didn’t do that we should’ve done that are under my purview, that’s my responsibility and I own that.”\n\nAsked if she ever offered to resign as a result of these crises, Sandberg said no.",
  "“I serve at the pleasure of Mark and our board and I’m going to keep working here for as long as they think I’m the right person to help lead and help lead us, not just out of this but for the future.”",
  "Facebook is now undergoing a major audit of its system to search for other cases similar to that of Cambridge Analytica, and Sandberg said it could be a while before people see the full results.",
  "\"As we find more Cambridge Analyticas, we’re going to find a comprehensive way to put them out and make sure people see them,” Sandberg said.",
  "On Wednesday, Facebook acknowledged that most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped via phone and email search.",
  "“That process is going to take a long time; there were a lot of apps,” she said.",
  "“I take responsibility for this,” she said.",
  "The company has since patched that up.",
  "“The buck stops with us.",
  "The buck stops with me."
