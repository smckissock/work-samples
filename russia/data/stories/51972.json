  "On Friday, a joint statement from the DHS and the Director of National Intelligence declared Russia was behind the DCLeaks.com and Guccifer 2.0 operations, which have published numerous documents from attacks on not just the DNC but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) too.",
  "Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton was compelled to blame Russia for trying to hack the election during the second presidential debate last night, following the Department of Homeland Security's brief statement Friday that Putin's regime was to blame for a number of breaches.",
  "\"Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election,\" Clinton said.",
  "At around 45 minutes into the debate (47 minutes in the video below), Clinton addressed references she made to Steven Spielberg's Abraham Lincoln biopic, after Wikileaks released a batch of paid speeches on Friday.",
  "That included the significant compromise of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), though it remains unclear if electoral systems in various states were targeted by the Russian government, according to the DHS.",
  "She shifted the conversation to focus on the part Wikileaks is playing in the election and Russia's alleged surreptitious puppeteering of the site to enhance its own aims with stolen documents.",
  "She asked for Trump to release his tax returns \"so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationship that he has with Russian and other foreign powers.\"",
  "He declined to comment on who might have been behind the WADA attacks, though noted it was interesting the hackers had called themselves the Fancy Bears, rather than the singular.",

  "CrowdStrike's Shawn Henry, a former FBI lead of cybersecurity, told FORBES Guccifer 2.0 wasn't just one person, but many who were working to disrupt the election.",
  "\"WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information - we don't even know if it's accurate information - and then they put it out.",
  "The so-called Fancy Bear hackers, as named by US security firm CrowdStrike, have also been linked to attacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).",
  "\"They're very careful with their timing,\" Henry added, just two days before America came out in earnest with its attribution.",
  "I know, I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.",
  "Trump responded, saying Clinton didn't know if Russia was behind the breaches.",
  "I don't deal there, I have no businesses there, I have no loans from Russia.\"",
  "They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\"",
  "He predicted things were only set to get worse in the coming weeks.",
  "Russia has repeatedly denied sponsorship any of the hacks.",
  "And believe me they're not doing it to get me elected.",
  "But they always blame Russia...",
  "I know nothing about Russia.",
  "\"Maybe there is no hacking."
