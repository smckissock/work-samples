  "The real-estate mogul appeared in a music video for Agalarov, whose website describes him as “an accomplished entertainer … [whose] songs are played in heavy rotation on Russian and international radio stations alike, and he performs concerts all over the world.” One of those concerts took place at a Trump golf course, according to Forbes, and another at the Miss Universe contest.",
  "Trump, who owned the contest at the time, had long pursued the idea of a Trump Tower in Moscow, though that deal never happened; Trump also had dealings in Azerbaijan, which a story in the New Yorker described as his “worst” ever—though Agalarov says he played no role in that deal.",
  "In the interview with the Chicago Tribune, Agalarov called Trump “a super-successful businessman.”\n\n“His main advantage over other world leaders that sometimes come to power is that he actually ran a huge corporation,” he said.",
  "The younger Agalarov is listed as executive vice president of the Crocus Group, in charge of its retail-entertainment complexes, restaurants, as well as a Caspian resort in Azerbaijan, the former Soviet republic.",
  "To that end, he says he exchanged messages with Donald Jr. around the time of the inauguration, but was told no deals could be pursued until the company’s leadership structure had further settled into place.",
  "He said he exchanged messages with Donald Trump Jr. in January and that the president sent him a handwritten note after the Agalarovs congratulated him on his election victory.",
  "Donald Trump’s links to the Agalarovs date to the Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013, which the father and son had wanted to bring to the Russian capital.",
  "The president has not yet commented on the meeting between his son and the Russian lawyer; nor has he said anything about the Agalarovs, his Russian friends.",
  "He’s very good at it.”\n\nIn March, Forbes reported that Agalarov claimed to have been in touch with the Trump family since last November’s election.",
  "The magazine added:\n\nAgalarov knows that maintaining that good favor will require continued contact with Trump's inner circle.",
  "Trump also wished Agalarov a happy 35th birthday, calling him a “winner” and a “champ.” The feeling is apparently mutual.",
  "Until 2015, Agalarov was married to Leila Aliyeva, the daughter of Azeri President Ilham Aliyev.",
  "“He built a big business over the years and guided thousands of people towards certain goals.",
  "“Now that he ran and was elected, he does not forget his friends,” Agalarov told Forbes.",
  "A lot of the politicians that come to power have never even managed a hundred people.",
  "And Agalarov has testified to the president’s loyalty.",
  "Still, Agalarov has claimed close ties with Trump.",
  "That is his main advantage."
