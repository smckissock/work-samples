  "In a small business solicitation from April 2017, SOCOM asked American businesses \"to explore whether it is feasible to reverse engineer or reengineer and domestically produce\" a 7.62 x 54mm belt-fed light machine gun that resembles a PKM, and a 12.7 x 108mm heavy machine gun that resembles a Russian-designed NSV.",
  "Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"Several countries hold licenses for manufacturing Russian machine guns of this model, but the US is not among them,\" Russian senator Viktor Bondarev, who helms the Russian parliament's Committee on Defense and Security, told state media last Wednesday.",
  "\"Developing a domestic production capability for foreign-like weapons addresses these issues while being cost effective as well as strengthens the nation's military-industrial complex, ensures a reliable and secure supply chain, and reduces acquisition lead times.\"",
  "\"But there are also concerns about the US associating with individuals who might be involved in some shady or illicit activities, and I think there has been an increasing concern that US laws are becoming more restrictive on supporting China and Russia.\"",
  "Kalashnikov Concern— the Russian firm renowned for designing the AK-47 assault rifle — was caught off guard by US Special Operations Command's desire to \"reverse engineer\" and \"domestically produce\" Russian-styled weapons.",

  "Speaking to state media, Rostec said they were unaware of SOCOM's plans, adding that the manufacture of Russian small arms in the US without permission from them would be considered intellectual theft.",
  "REUTERS\n\nThe Security Assistance Monitor, a group that tracks and analyzes US security assistance programs, said that moving production stateside could have several other benefits for SOCOM.",
  "The SOCOM solicitation said applicants will have to manufacture the weapons only on US territory, using only US-produced materials and employing only US citizens.",
  "\"It adds risk when you have to buy them from former Soviet states or other countries,\" said Colby Goodman, director of the Security Assistance Monitor.",
  "Small changes in an American-designed system could also allow reproduction of NSV and PK machine guns while still honoring the original copyrights.",
  "In statements through state-controlled media, Russian leaders and industry officials warned the US military not to copy its coveted weapon designs.",
  "\"Foreign made weapons lack interchangeability and standardization which hinders field and depot-level part replacement,\" the solicitation reads.",
  "A salesperson demonstrates an AK-47 assault rifle at the newly opened Kalashnikov souvenir store in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, Russia.",
  "\"If someone wants to carry out this work legally ... they should approach Rosoboronexport [Russia's state arms exporter] and discuss it.",
  "Reuters/Maxim Shemetov\n\nThere are so many knock-offs of older Russian weapons, though, that Rostec's complaint may not hold much water.",
  "Foreign copies of both the NSV and PK machine guns have proliferated since the weapons were fielded in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
  "Otherwise, this would amount to the illegal copying of Russian innovations or theft, simply speaking,\" Rostec said in a statement.",

  "SOCOM's quest for a domestic manufacturer could also have been tied to the issue of Russian sanctions, Goodman added.",
  "\"The trafficking risks and the production risks for the US military to be engaged in shady deals are significant.\"",
  "One problem: the solicitation is more than a year old and portions of the contract have already been awarded.",
  "\"We should prevent any attempts to use Russian weapons developments without our permission,\" Bondarev added.",
  "\"If U.S. intentions evolve into real actions ... then we should react decisively and promptly.\"",
  "SOCOM said the second phase, to demonstrate a production capacity, is already underway.",
  "That clear line of development is important for accountability, Goodman said.",
  "Kalishnikov's parent company, Rostec, is a state-owned enterprise in Russia.",
  "\"There could be concerns about the quality of the weapons,\" Goodman added.",
  "\"It's maybe not a bad idea to have the US engage in this,\" Goodman said.",
