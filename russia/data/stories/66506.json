  "Along with alcohol, Andrew Marr was on 13 different medications to treat his symptoms — opiates, narcotics, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety and depression meds, along with \"pills to help me wake up, pills to help me sleep,\" Marr recounted, all prescribed by military doctors.",
  "His complete healing spurred a desire in the two brothers to get their fledgling foundation on track with a clear purpose: They wanted to allow other veterans with TBIs to find the relief the way that Andrew did, through hormone therapy.",
  "After the results are in, the veteran and his family or caregivers are sent a detailed analysis of the results, and have a thorough consult by Skype with Dr. Gordon — or face-to-face, if the vet lives in or near Los Angeles.",
  "I thought I just needed time.”\n\nIn Iraq, his military duties had him working around explosives, but he wasn’t attaching any special significance to that experience — it was part of his service, which he willingly performed.",
  "The goals of the foundation are clear: By 2020, it plans to have 500 doctors trained in Gordon's protocol for TBI, and they are focusing on getting academia to review their protocols and their successes.",
  "Crying jags, public displays of extreme emotion, panic attacks, escalating alcoholism — these were just a few symptoms that former Army Sergeant and Green Beret Andrew Marr, 34, was experiencing in 2014.",
  "\"Disbelief and distrust permeates the veterans community because they've been taken into a medical model giving them tons of meds, which only accelerates depression and suicidal ideation,\" said Gordon.",
  "“Now we know that effects of blast waves to the brain give concussion symptoms.”\n\nMarr's symptoms escalated to chronic fatigue, blurred vision, balance and hearing issues, migraines, and double vision.",
  "Enter Dr. Mark Gordon, a Los Angeles neuro-endocrinologist who read an article about the brothers and what they were going through, as well as what they hoped to do for others.",
  "The Warrior Angels Foundation understands that veterans caught in the Veterans Administration system may feel hopeless and skeptical of trying yet another approach to healing.",
  "\"The other people who suffer when a vet suffers is their family, and even the greater community, who is without what that vet could bring to the workforce,\" said Andrew Marr.",
  "Even through his own pain and struggle, the elder brother was determined to find a solution — and determined to help other vets who were going through what he was.",
  "Their waiting list is long, but if a vet in immediate need comes forward and can put any money toward the treatment, the foundation will fund the rest.",
  "\"Today I'm off all medication — and cognitively, physically, and psychologically I'm performing as good if not better than my pre-injury status.\"",
  "There are a few things at play in the brain that cause physical symptoms as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Andrew Marr.",
  "And to think Andrew wasn't even well himself when he started the idea of helping others,\" he added, with pride typical of a younger brother.",
  "“Just months after my return home, I, a 32-year-old once-virile male, was experiencing libido issues,” Andrew Marr told LifeZette bluntly.",
  "\"I turned down a promotion to major in the service for our Warrior Angels Foundation,\" Adam, who serves as co-founder and COO, said.",
  "This does not show up in any brain imagery, and swelling can happen a week, a month, a year, even up to 17 years after brain trauma.",
  "Or physical symptoms and behavioral issues may surface months or even years later, as they did with him after his return from duty.",
  "“It was very scary,” Marr’s younger brother, Adam Marr, 32, an army captain who served as an Apache helicopter pilot in Iraq, said.",
  "“You see this person, your brother, who you’ve always looked up to, who served in the elite Special Forces — and he looks normal.",
  "Stop the drinking!’ But it wasn’t that simple.”\n\nFour months after he returned home, the older Marr brother was in trouble.",
  "\"Dr. Gordon has 1300 documented cases who have had the same results I have experienced — 1200 civilians and 100 veterans.",
  "Adam Marr stayed right by his older brother's side, his passion for the newly inspired cause matching his brother's.",
  "During brain swelling, said Andrew Marr, an individual's hormones are thrown off their proper physiological levels.",
  "“We already had four children, waiting on our fifth, and my wife was thinking, ‘We have an enormous problem here.",
  "Our poor mom had three of us in active duty at once for a six-year stretch — and then to fight this other battle?",
  "Andrew Marr said, \"When you bring the brain back to its neuro-permissive state, it can then operate correctly.",
  "I was watching him work towards an early grave with his drinking, and I just kept thinking, ‘Rein it in, dude.",
  "A blood test kit will be mailed to you, and you will be given the name of a lab in your area to take it to.",
  "That lab will package it, and send it to the lab we use for testing — one of the world's premiere labs.\"",
  "\"We want to let veterans know that the therapy speaks for itself through its outcomes,\" Dr. Gordon said.",
  "Becky asked Andrew if he could keep his drinking down — in case he had to drive her to the hospital.",
  "“I was around explosions my entire career and was involved in multiple concussive blasts,” he said.",
  "\"We were in the dark,\" said Adam Marr, who watched helplessly as the brother he idolized got worse.",
  "He told Adam of his wish to start a foundation, and the two began an \"unfocused sort of operation.",
  "His low point came as he and his wife, Becky, were awaiting the birth of their fifth child.",
  "He entered our hormonal therapy, and within two weeks the voices disappeared completely.\"",
  "He urges hurting vets to get in touch through their website, warriorangelsfoundation.org.",
  "Follow-ups to tweak dosages occur regularly, and contact with Dr. Gordon remains ongoing.",
  "\"The first phase is the initial blunt-force trauma — the initial blast wave, in my case.",
  "Then there's the second invisible phase: post-traumatic inflammation, or brain swelling.",
  "They were just as intense as the physical, and just as painful for Marr and his family.",
  "And, of course, they want to keep helping veterans and their families — free of charge.",
  "\"We see this as helping military families, and by doing that, helping the country.\"",
  "\"I was having problems with crying in public, and issues with rage,\" Marr said.",
  "The foundation has streamlined the process to best serve those who need help.",
  "\"If you need help, go to our website and fill out the detailed questionnaire.",
  "He had just returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth area from deployment overseas.",
  "He was referring to individuals who have a TBI, or traumatic brain injury.",
  "\"One vet we helped had a voice in his head telling him to commit suicide.",
  "We knew we wanted to help people, but didn't know how,\" said Adam Marr.",
  "Adam Marr is grateful for his brother's return to health and happiness.",
  "\"I had panic attacks that left me with depression after they passed.",
  "He doesn’t love me anymore.’ I didn’t know what was happening to me.",
  "\"Our success rate with hormone therapy is 100 percent,\" said Andrew.",
  "I was having short-term memory loss, too, and vocabulary problems.",
  "\"You return from battle lucky to have your limbs and your life.",
  "Dr. Gordon echoes the brothers' passion for hormone therapy.",
  "\"Nobody makes it through this life on their own,\" he said.",
  "So I drank, to try to ease all this pain I was feeling.\"",
  "\"But the proof is in the pudding — we can help you.\"",
  "Desperate for relief, Marr agreed to try treatment.",
  "And he was falling apart before his family’s eyes.",
  "The foundation will help veterans free of charge.",
  "So symptoms might not show up until years later.\"",
  "\"I'm too passionate, and it's too close to home.",
  "It might be a minimal shift, hardly noticeable.",
  "\"I was better within weeks,\" said Andrew Marr.",
  "What happened next, many would call a miracle.",
  "But they emphasize that healing can happen.",
  "It's hormone therapy — and it's science.\"",
  "A 100 percent cure — at lightning speed.",
  "He began the hormone therapy right away.",
  "He said he might have an answer for him.",
  "The Warrior Angels Foundation was born.",
  "Dr. Gordon reached out to Andrew Marr.",
  "\"TBI is a two-phase injury,\" he said.",
  "Then the behavioral issues started.",
  "\"Reach out, and we'll reach back.\"",
  "How can you argue with that?\"",
  "\"It's simple,\" said Andrew.",
  "Frustrating, and scary.\"",
  "But he’s not.",
  "The results?"
