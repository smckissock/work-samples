  "In fact, if you would read 2011 \"The Boston Globe\" article, you'd see a remarkable similarity between Mr.\n\nMueller's conduct as assistant U.S. attorney and acting us attorney in Boston with respect to a corrupt relationship between an FBI agent now in prison and Whitey Bulger, remarkable similarity to Weissmann's conduct in the eastern district of New York with a corrupt relationship between FBI agent DeVecchio later charged with several murders and Gregory Scarpa, the underboss of the Colombo family.",
  "SCHOEN: But listen, Mr. Hannity, the model that people like Weissmann and specifically Weissmann used in the cases in the eastern district against Mr. Sesa (ph), Mr. Urena (ph), organized crime cases was using people as informants who are most unsavory people who would sell their souls for freedom and who were then coached, we now know recently got a letter from one of the informants at Weissmann used they were coached in their testimony told what to say.",
  "We need to talk about the fact that Obama took absolutely no action whatsoever one more time, because he just knew that it would not have any effect on the election and to the extent that the Russians are trying to help term, they could not get over the finish line because he knew that he was never going to be the president and he was wrong about that, but he is right about the lack of effect of the Russian interference on Trump's election.",
  "We know about January 5th and that meeting because the former national security adviser, remember, Susan Rice, she's the one that sent her email to herself on President Trump's inauguration day, and on the way out of the White House, Rice is describing a meeting from January 5th, 15 days prior when she and then Vice President Joe Biden, James Comey, the Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, herself and the president were all in this meeting.",
  "HANNITY: That was a political document, that indictment, because they know that they are not going to arrest any of the people, but your point is well taken, that there is Russian interference, there was and Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC brought to the Russians in, Dr. Gorka, they paid the Russians to be involved in this, short of the trolls, apart from the trolls and why wanted the Russians think that they could get away with it?",
  "A middle-of-the-road person, but he went off the rails in the last couple of days with a column of his that went viral, because of the anti-Trump rapid audience that suggested that maybe Trump is not attacking Vladimir Putin personally or imposing the sanctions right now, because he has so much to hide or he fear so much that he is so deeply into this collusion conspiracy that he is shaking in his boots.",
  "In the Mueller indictment of the 13 Russian nationals, it says that honor about the November 12 2016 the Russian trolls organized pro-Trump and anti-Trump rallies in the same day in New York City, deciding to take a look how fake news, the poll network CNN and MSNBC, the conspiracy network covered up the anti-Trump protest in New York City that day coming here is how they covered this.",
  "Hillary and the DNC, of course, Donna Brazile told us she was controlling the money at the DNC, they paid over, what, $12 million for these Russian lies, government lies, propaganda, to propagandize the American people influence the election another question asking when did you first become aware that the Steele dossier was used to obtain a FISA order on Carter Page.",
  "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: There are categories from the cold war, the useful idiot category, Michael Moore was a useful idiots when he shows up at that demonstration against Donald Trump that is organized by the Russians, but we are not talking about useful idiots when it comes to the FISA courts surveillance and the Steele dossier.",
  "HANNITY: You know look, I will do something that may surprise you, it is possible that nobody knew, I don't think that they did it wittingly, I think that for whatever influence, social media, firing your points that it was minimal, nobody would have known that this was a Russian rally, but the fact that they covered it with such enthusiasm is kind of funny.",
  "Breaking new developments tonight into the real Russian intrusion into the\n\n2016 election, the House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes, he is demanding answers tonight to find out what President Obama and his cohorts knew and when they found out about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier filled with Russian and Russian government lies.",
  "Then, 'LA Times' details how Weissmann has very close ties to the special counsel Robert Mueller which includes serving as his FBI general counsel for two years, maybe this will explain why Mueller decided to tap Weissmann as his lead prosecutor even though Weissmann has the most atrocious record of any lawyer that I've ever seen in my life.",
  "You believe that\n\nNunes is also asking those Obama officials if they had any contact with members of the media about this dossier and we learned that the former British spy Christopher Steele, he was briefing outlets like 'The New York Times,' 'The Washington Post', Yahoo News, fake news CNN, all about the dossier, all before the election.",
  "Now, Sara Carter reporting tonight that the chairman, Chairman Nunes, has sent a list of questions to senior Obama administration officials about Hillary's dirty Russian dossier and also new at this hour, the special counsel Robert Mueller, he has unsealed yet another criminal charge, albeit small against a lawyer for lying to the FBI.",
  "This is a fascinating article because Barnes is pointing out that since Robert Mueller indicted Russian trolls in part for failing to register as foreign agents and for not reporting their activities to the FEC, well, not in the indictment, it is in the overall text if you actually read the indictment.",
  "I want to ask this in relation to Russia's point, which I thought was brilliant, which was wait a minute, if they would have done it in this particular case, that means Hillary, that means Fusion, that means Christopher Steele, that means everyone else would have the same standards would have applied.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Transmit to Vladimir, great job, joining us with reaction National Syndicated Radio host Larry Elder, Fox News correspondent at large, somebody apparently that is hanging Larry with the President at Mar- a-Lago and we did not get an invitation, what is up with that Geraldo?",
  "The President tweeted tonight 'bad ratings CNN, MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti- Trump Russian rally, wall-to-wall, they probably knew that it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they posted hard anyway, two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is watching.'",
  "People testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee this last summer that it happened to them, that Fusion GPS phonied up a dossier to smear them and that's what they did through Christopher Steele, an ex-British spy, who conjured out of thin air what is on its face a preposterous dossier.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: We have not been able to independently confirm that to that rally was literally set up by the Russian trolls, but it's kind of it's funny that the mainstream media was playing right into Vladimir Putin's hands apparently, according to the Media Research Center.",
  "What President Obama assumed is that it did not matter what happened, Trump was going to lose, and most of the country felt that way, and he told Trump to stop whining and win the election, how is it any different than Laura Ingraham saying to basketball players shut up and dribble?",
  "What Rush is saying here is brilliant it's that Mueller may have been shielding Hillary Clinton by limiting the charges announced against the Russian trolls because all of that could have been applied to Fusion GPS, Hillary Clinton, the campaign, Perkins Coie and the rest of them.",
  "TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Yes, I think it was a fundamentally dishonest document designed to distract from the fact that the Russia collusion allegations against Donald Trump are collapsing and the reason for being of the Mueller investigation is disappearing.",
  "So, if Mueller does care even a little bit about the equal application under the law, equal justice under the law, well, he'd be investigating Hillary Clinton for destroying evidence at an FBI investigation, and that could be just the start of Clinton's legal troubles.",
  "So, I hope the viewers recognize that for you to be speaking out and demanding an examination of tactics of a prosecutor is remarkable and extraordinary and very important, and that it can -- what you've done is exposed the problems with the tactics being used here.",
  "The defendants allegedly conspired to defraud the U.S. by impairing the lawful functions of the FEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of State in administrating federal requirements of disclosure for foreign involvement certain domestic activities.",
  "We have been saying on this program for months now that we want to know what former Obama officials like John Brennan, James Clapper, Susan Rice, the new queen of unmasking, Samantha Power, and Ben Rhodes and President Obama, what they knew, when they knew it.",
  "I guess that is funny, but the real story is talking about the rallies that happen on November 12th that were pro-Trump, and this is the argument that he is making what happened on November 12, what happened, what matters is what happened before November 8th.",
  "Congressional investigations have uncovered that the Obama FBI, DOJ and even the State Department of Obama all either were given the dossier or were told about what was in the dossier so the number of people potentially involved is vast and it is widespread.",

  "She's reporting that the House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes is now asking former top Obama administration officials for answers about how much the former president knew about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier and when he found out about it.",
  "Oh no collusion and included the legal documents and it's some very interesting information, by the way, and Mueller outlines how the lawyer deleted oh that sounds familiar and didn't hand over emails that have been requested by the special counsel.",
  "Mueller thinks that what this lawyer did was wrong and illegal, then maybe he should take a cold hard look at the 33,000 emails that were subpoenaed that she erased, then acid washed, then BleachBit and that had her aides beat up with a hammer.",
  "RIVERA: Yes, I think that if anything that shock, Sean is that it has taken this long to get to the incontrovertible fact that President Obama has consistently poo pooed the impact of Russia in American internal affairs election and so forth.",
  "In 2012 the pivotal moment in his debate with Governor Mitt Romney was after Mitt Romney said Russia is the biggest geopolitical prophase, President Obama said you can never forget this, the cold war is going and once its foreign policy back.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place.",
  "And remember, before President Obama left office, remember he amended that executive order 12333, that made it easier to share information across 17 government intelligence agencies by the way he never worked under this executive order.",
  "Remember, it expanded to the State Department and this is what Devin Nunes is probably looking at as well, which is the reason why he sent these letters to senior Obama administration officials, which he did not name but it's expansive.",
  "Andrew McCabe behind closed doors but it's now been leaked to the media admitted that there wasn't a single thing in that dossier that the FBI could prove except the Carter Page had flown to Moscow to give a speech which is not a crime.",
  "But on the other hand they were also messing around significantly by trying to destroy Donald Trump through this dossier leaking through Russian intelligence services to the Clinton campaign that wandered into the Obama, DOJ, and FBI.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: I wanted to present you with a little gift which represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying, that we want to reset our relationship.",
  "So, if we're going to go off this precedent set by the Russia indictment, all the conditions are there in this case, Robert Mueller should be investigating Steele, Clinton, Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, the DNC, and Hillary Clinton.",
  "TARLOV: There are people that refuse that McCabe said that, we were on that night when the Grassley memo came out and we were emphasizing it, and you said, the bulk of it, which means that there was other evidence that was use.",

  "When we come back, we will hold President Obama accountable for all of its failures as it relates to Russia, something that the mainstream media says they care about Russia, full of crap, we will explain straight ahead.",
  "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYSNDICATE HOST: Sean, the reason that President Obama did not take more action even though he was aware of the Russian interfering is because he assumed it would not have any effect.",
  "The President is right, the Obama administration constantly sucked up to the Vladimir Putin regime giving them a pass including this cringe worthy moment featuring the now infamous Russian reset that never worked.",
  "If Mueller's going after Russian trolls, then maybe he'd be OK with prosecuting Steele and the people paying him to create a phony dossier full of Russian lies that they tried to use to lie to the American people.",
  "And you have in many ways the Obama administration reacted appropriately to what the Russians were doing as alleged in this indictment, because they were having an in material impact on our public policy process.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no serious person out there that would suggest that somehow that you could even rig America's elections.",
  "And speaking of the application, remember, in the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk of that FISA warrant application relied on the garbage this dossier had in it that Fusion GPS and the FBI never verified.",
  "TARLOV: Go and if you look at fact-check Donald Trump tweets about the fact that he is on (inaudible) for Russians and Obama they gave him the false that it could be when you look at what Obama did.",
  "Dr. Gorka, there's so much to unravel here on so many different levels and what we're really beginning to see is that more and more there's evidence that this goes back to the Obama administration.",
  "This is from the DOJ's announcement from last Friday when they actually went out and said -- when they said the indictment includes eight criminal counts and criminal conspiracy, defraud the U.S.",
  "By the way President Trump now slamming Obama for his tepid response to Russia's bizarre behavior, tweeting 'I've been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts, total fake news.'",
  "Here with reaction to tonight's news opening monologue, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton and former deputy assistant to the president, FOX News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka.",
  "ELDER: Sean, in addition to everything that we talked about the Russian reset, the Czech Republic under the bus and about to the hot Mike saying, I will have more flexibility down the election.",
  "The President thought that the indictment of the 13 Russians which stated very specifically the indictment that any American involvement was unwitting would be President Trump's victory lap.",
  "Sara Carter's reporting that Congressman Nunes, he sent letters to many unnamed former senior Obama officials in an attempt to find out the extent of their knowledge about the phony dossier.",
  "It's time for President Obama -- you got to start telling the American people what you knew when you knew it on the dossier and especially we want to find out what the former president knew.",
  "It was renewed three times afterwards and yet people like James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein, oh and we can't forget Lisa Page and her mistress -- and her boyfriend.",
  "Let's use a phrase from the military, Hillary Clinton, her lawyers and the DNC were forced multipliers for Russian propaganda that attacked a Presidential candidate during an election.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: The things these Russians were charged with in the Mueller indictment are wire fraud, defrauding the United States, mail fraud.",
  "When did he know that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for these Russian lies, and did he know that the dossier was used to spy on a member of the Trump campaign in an election year?",
  "These charges that the Russians were hit with in this indictment have nothing to do with the avowed purpose of the special counsel investigation, literally nothing to do with it.",
  "And if these Russians were charged the way everybody thought charges were going to happen, then they could charge Hillary and they could charge Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS.",
  "It is the most preposterous notion based on no fact and so Tom Friedman becomes a collusionista it is very sad and I think systematic, symbolic of what the left is trying to do.",
  "He said it was on verified and he also briefed then President-elect Trump about the fake news dossier and that was in January 2017, and he said the same thing to Donald Trump.",
  "So, in addition to finding out what Obama knew when he knew it, when it comes to the dossier, we're now asking the same questions about the Russian election interference.",
  "Sara Carter last Friday broke the story about how in a 1997 case Weissmann was officially reprimanded by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence, not the first time.",
  "What do we do now that we have a special prosecutor that seemingly has exceeded his authority that has put a team of abusively politically and biased people on this team?",
  "But we're also looking at information being fed through the State Department, through allies of Clinton back to Christopher Steele, which was then placed in the dossier.",
  "He further believed that to the degree that Donald Trump was being held by the Russians they would not help Donald Trump win the election and he is right about that too.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want your show, I listen to it on TV because when I see that part in your hair, I don't know if it was made by a hand towel or a pizza cutter.",
  "But the point is that they know they cannot change the results of the election, but what they say is that they want to come together and show America that love is love.",
  "We're calling it a dereliction of duty especially when you consider what Obama said just a couple of weeks before the election lecturing Donald Trump to stop whining.",
  "It may be that the most effective thing we do is exactly what you're doing, the media may be the most important element in all of this because again, transparency.",
  "Well, does that create a legal standard from Mueller to go after Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS, the law firm Perkins Coie, the DNC, and Hillary Clinton herself?",
  "And rather than respond appropriately and protect Mr. Trump from the smear effort by the Russians they use it as a pretext to target and spy on him and his team.",
  "Because defense lawyers argued that by threatening these 114 people with prosecution, Weismann was able to block testimony that could have helped their clients.",
  "Anyway, the president has been slamming Obama on Twitter -- President Trump that is -- for his response to not responding to the Russian election interference.",
  "The next question, when did you first learn or come to believe that the steel dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.",
  "President Trump has been tough on Russia through the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and through the United States, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.",
  "No serious president would have ignored the warnings in they would have known that Russia was a hostile nation with a hostile actor named Vladimir Putin.",
  "We now know from two Republican memos that the dossier to spy on Carter Page, Trump associate was first granted in October of 2016, before the election.",

  "Donald Trump wasn't running, and we now know despite warnings back in 2014 from people like Congressman Devin Nunes, President Obama did nothing.",
  "Anyway, we also have more damning information about special counsel Mueller's corrupt top investigator Andrew Weissmann, his so-called pit bull.",
  "It's hard to even fathom how anybody is corrupt and crooked as Weissmann could ever be considered to be part of Mueller's special counsel team.",
  "It simply talks to, you know, the ability or the inability to be subtle about a cover-up when you're no longer than national security advisor.",
  "This is the one the FBI relied heavily on to get that FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page during an election year.",
  "That is the scandal in the fundamentals of the scandal how to change with the press release/indictment on Friday that is going to go nowhere.",
  "Well, he was there the entire time, documenting, uncovering everything, bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering and they did nothing.",
  "So, while they talk broadly about it in the indictment and they mention it in their press release, that's not what they were charged with.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMORGAN RADFORD, MSNBC: People have said what is the point, do you have all of these different groups coming together.",
  "And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders schools the media today on how President Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama.",
  "TARLOV: He is not, you heard in Adam Schiff this weekend talking about on the Sunday show that they thought Obama should have done more.",
  "He was told in early August by presumably the CIA that Russia was trying to get involved or meddling pretty strongly with the election.",
  "Here's the headline: does Mueller's indictment when you read it mean Clinton's campaign can be indicted herself for Christopher Steele.",
  "HANNITY: That should have happened a long time ago and he should never have been allowed to put this abusively by his team together.",
  "After all, Vladimir Putin put his operatives in America and got our 20 percent of our uranium, why would they think anything else?",
  "But and then again, most of Mueller's team is filled with Democratic donors, so maybe that's what Mueller was going for all along.",
  "JARRETT: All three of them for violating campaign laws, a Foreign Registration Act and a myriad of other potential crimes as well.",
  "We also know that that McCabe testified without the dossier that application for that FISA warrant never would have been approved.",

  "If there is no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances where that will happen this time.",
  "GPS is bad enough that we're looking at Christopher Steele, a foreign ex-agent, British spy, working with the Russians.",
  "And the 'LA Times' is reporting as part of the Enron prosecution, Weissmann named people as unindicted co-conspirators.",
  "There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.",
  "In the end, Weissmann got bailed out by his powerful friend and his name was retroactively removed from the complaint.",
  "We've told you how he's biased, a political partisan hack how he's donated thousand to the Democrats, including Obama.",
  "There are lots of times that we have covered Trump rallies that I absolutely had the influence of Russians behind it.",
  "That includes allowing Vladimir Putin to wrestle control of 20 percent of our uranium when it's in short supply.",
  "He did not believe that the Russians could materially affect to the outcome of the election, and he was right.",

  "Of course, Clinton used it to try and influence and manipulate the minds of the American people.",
  "You may not alter or remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from copies of the content.",
