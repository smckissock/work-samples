  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nSIDNEY POWELL, AMERICA FIRST SENIOR POLICY ADVISER: One of our favorite people, yes, that helped frame General Flynn, barred the inspector general from any access to the national security division of the Department of Justice when the machinations were happening and Bruce Ohr was running a back channel between the FBI and Christopher Steele after Christopher Steele was fired from the FBI for lying to them.",
  "GOODLATTE: The risk is you will get an unbalanced bill where you work address DACA and none of these other things and 180, 190 Democrats were joined with 30 or 40 Republicans and pass something that the overwhelming majority of house Republicans and the overwhelming majority of House Republicans, the American people and certainly the Republican base would not be satisfied with because it wouldn't address the problem.",
  "It is quite obvious that John Brennan was at the head of a group of people who were going to create a counterintelligence investigation against Trump by creating false information which was going to be fed through Carter Page and fed through George Papadopoulos so that it would be picked up, reported back to Washington and provide the basis for a counter -- a fake counterintelligence investigation.",
  "INGRAHAM: One of the other thing is that I think is very frustrating to the American people is the fact that we have these repeat border crossers, people who have jumped the border multiple times, have been deported, come back into the country and yet they still get the oh, my gosh, what are you going to do about the poor immigrants, our communities are being shattered because of this enforcement.",
  "That's what the legislation that I along with Mike McCall, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Raul Labrador, chairman of the immigration subcommittee, Martha McSally, chairman of the Border subcommittee, came up with, and it does address the DACA situation in a fair way, but only in exchange for making sure that we don't let this problem continue in the future.",
  "INGRAHAM: The American people don't get the same treatment from Kamala Harris and others who we will be quoting tonight in the show because it's always a one-way street and I think those who are charged with actually enforcing the law are always meant to be the bad guys and yet the American citizens elected Donald Trump because they wanted that situation were reversed.",
  "There's a lot of people in America who would like to tell you if you don't like it here, go somewhere else, because I will tell you something, many of the Africans you people like to call African-Americans, you yourselves, there are many Africans that would love to come to this country and trade places with you, and they would do it in a New York minute.",
  "It's important to address this issue, but this issue is how are we going to secure our borders, close the loopholes like the asylum loophole that you just described, and there are many others, and make sure that people have confidence that their government will keep them safe in their communities and along the border of this country.",
  "INGRAHAM: But we hear that there might be another caravan making its way up from -- I don't know where we got the new caravan, a biblical, people are coming up again because they feel like as long as they get to the border they can get into the country and they will ultimately be released, correct, or are they not being released?",
  "And I think they used that raw FISA intel to put together their fake narrative and essentially recycled it through Christopher Steele and other people with probably input from others in the intel community, people at the State Department like Sidney Blumenthal and of course, Peter Strzok and his role in it.",
  "So why on earth if you are going to go to the FISA court and go through all the hoops that you have to do to get an approval of the FISA warrant, go to a federal judge, swear out an application, relying on it, and then for the predictive purposes of an intelligence assessment you are not going to use it?",
  "The way the system works right now the threshold is so low, about 80 percent past that initial interview but only 20 percent are granted asylum by a judge, which tells us that 80 percent of that is either just a flat-out fraud or somebody who thinks they can come here because they want a job here.",
  "It looked like he tried to weasel away from that, or somebody speaking on his behalf did, but it turns out that his lawyer when confronted by Grassley sent a letter in saying he stands by his testimony, so the uncorrected record now is that he was told they had a source inside the campaign.",
  "So if you combine this with everything that went on, it's pretty clear I think that what they did was they made a scheme that allowed them to perpetuate the investigation without cluing Trump in on exactly what the investigation was about, and that's why they told him he wasn't a suspect.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSPIKE LEE, FILM DIRECTOR: -- was given the chance to say we are about love and not hate, and that -- did not denounce the -- Klan, the alt-right and those Nazi --\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And that might not be the most controversial thing the filmmaker said.",
  "If you are going to hit them for giving an uncorroborated dossier to the FISA court, I'm not sure it's fair to also say that they shouldn't be allowed to do the things you are supposed to do to verify and corroborate things, which is to use informants and that sort of thing.",
  "INGRAHAM: They've got to have more than this poor bumbling Carter Page, God bless them, or this Papadopoulos minor figure in London who it looks like they are trying to set up by having the contact go and meet with him and plant stories with him as Joe D. just said.",
  "But the petition has been signed by others as well, including, unbelievably, Utah's Mia Love, Will Hurd of Texas, Mario Diaz Barart and Ileana Ross-Lehtinen of Florida, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania whose votes don't count even though he's already resigned.",
  "REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R—VIRGINIA: Well, Laura, we have control of the House, we have control of the Senate, we have the White House, why would we turn that control back over to the Democrats and have another fiasco like the ones that you just described?",
  "You have actually overseen a huge increase in border enforcement and workplace enforcement, raids and so forth, which I think are being welcomed by the American people, but again, the media and the Democrats are hitting you for shattering communities.",

  "Let's discuss this and other developments with former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy whose peace in \"National Review\" today is titled \"Retracting the Retraction, Fusion Simpson stands by testimony that FBI had a spy in Trump's campaign.\"",
  "And there have been moments where there's been a slip here or there, but everybody has recognized that that is aberrational, that the rule, the norm is that the White House doesn't have anything to do with criminal investigations.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOODLATTE: The answer is he should work with the Republican leadership and with the committee, the Judiciary Committee, to produce one bill that Republicans can get behind and the president can sign into law.",
  "And what they've been trying to backtrack all along is that the origin of this investigation -- if you are going to do something as serious as do surveillance on a political campaign, you better have a very, very good reason.",

  "At a moment, when the \"Real Clear Politics\" average now has the generic ballot tightening from a previous 13-point advantage for Democrats to basically within the margin of error, basically a dead heat now.",
  "It would essentially give the Democrats and a few liberal Republicans run of the House floor and the ability to bring several immigration bills to a vote, including a bill granting amnesty to the DACA kids.",
  "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: The state of play now is that it is abundantly clear that there was no legitimate basis even for a counterintelligence investigation, let alone in criminal investigation.",
  "It was not a full intelligence community product, and they did it because they were furthering a narrative that the election was -- that Russia stole the election, it was hacking and it was done for Trump.",
  "Determined to fulfill his campaign promises and focus on Americans first, the president urged Congress on Capitol Hill today as they have since taken office to tighten restrictions on illegal immigration.",
  "People don't realize that there are two court opinions from the FISA court in which the court outlines how illegally FISA intelligence information was given to private contractors that the FBI was using.",
  "So the inauguration has already happened, Trump is already sworn in, and she types out an email to herself reiterating, or stating that Obama always wanted to do things, I think she said by the book.",
  "If they want to do something to actually help America, what they should do is urge some more moderate Democrats to help reform, let's say, the asylum process that is being abused today by illegals.",

  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHOUSE SPEAKER REP. PAUL RYAN, R—WI: We never want to turn the floor over to the minority and what I don't want to do is have a process that just ends up with a veto.",
  "So, rather than keeping a focus on the economy that is booming, these Republicans have decided it's in their political interest to turn the spotlight to immigration and the DACA kids.",
  "I called them liberal Republicans, who are pushing this new DACA amnesty right now and trying to push this discharge position, it ran through the House of Representatives at least.",
  "All these things that are multiplier effects on illegal immigration and immigration amnesty in this country, massive increases in legal immigration, none of it would be affected.",
