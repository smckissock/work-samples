  "| Getty Paul Manafort to register as foreign agent\n\nWASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said Wednesday.",
  "Manafort has said: \"I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation,\" and his spokesman, Maloni, has said there was nothing improper about his political consulting in Ukraine, including how he was paid.",
  "Manafort's resignation from the campaign came immediately after the AP had reported that Manafort's consulting firm between 2012 and 2014 orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party without disclosing that it was working as a foreign agent.",
