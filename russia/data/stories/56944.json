  "Story highlights Congressional investigators want to hear from former Trump adviser Carter Page\n\nIt's unclear whether Page will answer the House intelligence committee's questions\n\n(CNN) The House intelligence committee plans to release a transcript of an interview scheduled for next week with former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, a committee source told CNN on Friday.",
  "The Senate intelligence committee has issued a subpoena to Page after he told the committee earlier this month that he would plead the Fifth Amendment to keep from turning over a \"vast array\" of documents the panel requested, which he argued was \"beyond the charter\" of its probe.",
  "Page is slated to testify behind closed doors, but the committee is planning to use a unique format for the hearing that will allow a transcript of the interview to be publicly available three days afterward, the source said.",
  "Page, whose testimony has been sought by several congressional panels investigating Russian election meddling, is being interviewed by the House intelligence panel Thursday.",
  "A second committee source told CNN that means the hearing will be held in the panel's closed spaces in the Capitol, without the public or media present.",
  "The House intelligence hearing with Page on November 2 was listed on the committee's website as \"open in a closed space.\"",
  "But it will be an unclassified hearing, the source said, which allows for the release of the transcript.",
  "It's still unclear whether Page plans to answer the House committee's questions.",
  "Page did not respond to CNN questions about his House hearing.",
