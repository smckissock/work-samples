  "And you know, when you look at all this you want to call circumstantial evidence about Comey about McCabe, about Strzok, about all of them up there, that is far more significant than anything that was ever brought up against Donald Trump or the Trump Campaign and yet there was this massive now 18-20 month investigation, federal investigation going on of the Trump Campaign and the evidence is none and yet there is much more circumstantial evidence at least against the highest levels of the FBI and the case of McCabe, you'll actually have the Inspector General accuse him of lying.",
  "And then, later on, in March when Director Comey announced on national television before a committee hearing that the president's campaign was being investigated as if this was a major announcement, and you know, we go back to look at it, it was based on basically gossip, it did not come through normal channels, it did not warrant an investigation like this, and also Jim Comey was giving the country the impression the president was being investigated even though he knew the president was not being investigated but refused to make that public.",
  "BARTIROMO: I understand but I'm still skeptical of all of these polls and all of these things that show the Dems in the lead because I think most people do not want the abusive power that we've seen on the left at the top of the FBI for example, and they do not want the shaming that we see continually and what they do want is a better economic story for themselves, lower taxes, rollback in regulation that is clearly working for the average guy and gal out there today.",
  "We're very close to historic peace but we also are very close to war because if they try to play Trump, if Kim Jong Un meets with President Trump and goes back to his old way of doing business, we're on a path to war and I hope China knows that and I hope North Korea knows it, and if I were the North Koreans I would not meet with Donald Trump unless I was deadly serious about giving up my nukes because if you play Trump, you're going to be a big loser.",
  "And Tester took anonymous charges, threw them out there, didn't provide any witnesses, didn't you know, basically treated them as fact, alleged the Secret Service, had said the Secret Service had to restrain Jackson from banging on a door of a female assistant during a presidential trip and -- because they didn't want to wake President Obama and that turned out to be -- the Secret Service said, we have no evidence whatsoever that that ever took place.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BLACKSTONE GROUP: The path they were on by threatening nuclear war against the United States and having the United States react to that, which anybody would, organizing sanctions regime which was very tough, and getting the support, the wider support of the world, and the Chinese have done a terrific job in terms of limiting goods and services that can go to Korea.",
  "They're tracking their citizens and if you do anything that is, you know, seeming to be against what the government warrants like for example, if you smoke outside, your name goes on this list and you drop a few points and it might be harder to get a mortgage, it might get harder -- I mean this list, because they're tracking the citizens how does that change the dynamic for the U.S. trying to partner with China on trade?",
  "BARTIROMO: So it was all Tester who made sure that speculation about Ronny Jackson got out into the press so that everybody would talk about why he was not right for the job and then we hear the Secret Service come out yesterday and said absolutely no evidence on any of those things that he wrecked a car, that he got you know, all of the things that were out there, the Secret Service says, there's no evidence of it.",
  "We see it in these special elections where more Democrats stand to turn out than do Republicans even though Republicans have won five of the six special Congressional elections, the Democrats are pressing, but we've got a long time between now and the election, but yes, you've got to balance the question of fairness versus the anger on the hard left of the Democratic Party.",
  "He's working with China to stop the threat from North Korea and China knows that if there's a war in North Korea it's going to be in their backyard, not our backyard and Mnuchin is going to China to say, hey, we want a better relationship but you've got to change your business practices and I just really appreciate how tough President Trump has been when it comes to China.",
  "BARTIROMO: You know, I remember when I set down with the president in an interview last year, it was last April, and we sat there talking about his meeting with the president of China, President Xi, and he said we were having this delicious chocolate cake during dessert and that's when I said to him guess what, Mr. President, we just sent strikes to Syria.",
  "He could turn this from a situation where Tester's opponent can make this an issue of fairness and equity and what ought to go on in Washington but if the president makes charges like he did and said I know things and I'm going to say these things, unless they're true, he could just give Tester a way to wiggle out of this.",
  "16 of the 23 Republican incumbents are running for re-election and traditionally better than nine out of every ten incumbents get re-elected and they will get re-elected if they run a strong campaign with a message just like you articulated and put together the resources and volunteers necessary to get that message out.",
  "GRAHAM: Not only was the Clinton email investigation a joke, the dossier was used inappropriately\n\nBARTIROMO: So how do you call yourself someone who you know, agrees with and follows the rule of law if in fact you used a piece of garbage as, you know, the reason to wiretap and listen in on an American citizen?",
  "They come up with these lies, put it in there, in a dossier and then they use it to wiretap somebody on the Trump campaign and now lies about Ronny Jackson that's completely, you know, smeared him and then of course there's the shaming and the attacks last night, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, Karl.",
  "We should have a special counsel looking at DOJ corruption, looking at how the dossier was given to the court and finally the number four person at the Department of Justice, Mr. Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, worked with Michael Steele who prepared the dossier and he was Steele's handler.",
  "KING: First of all, I do support the money for the wall but the reason I voted for that bill is because President Trump personally asked me to and he also tweeted to all Republicans saying out we should vote for the bill because while it wasn't perfect it was the best we could get at the time.",
  "Regarding Syria, where the barbaric Assad regime is propped up by Iran, the United States top priorities are to defeat ISIS, deescalate violence, deter the use of chemical weapons and ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and support them also of political resolution to the conflict.",
  "Now, this is really important to us because the counterintelligence investigation uses the tools of our intelligence services that are not supposed to be used on American citizens so we've long wanted to know well what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation.",
  "As part of the president's comprehensive Iran strategy, we are also working to counter the broad set of non-nuclear threats, Iran's missile system, its support for Hezbollah, the importations of thousands of proxy fighters into Syria, and its assistance to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
  "KALLSTROM: Right, well that's -- yes, that was -- that's part of you know, act one where the FBI just gave a pass to the Clintons and did this outrageous stuff that like kindergarten investigations, you know, with no subpoenas, no search warrants, no grand jury, no nothing.",
