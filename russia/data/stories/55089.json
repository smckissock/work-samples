  "Even after 15 years at the helm, Mr. Erdogan, whose skills as an orator even his opponents envy, treats every event like a campaign rally — and he turns just about every day into one.",
  "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan makes up to three every weekday — two a day on weekends — and his charismatic, combative talks are the primary vehicle of his success.",
  "He calls democracy advocates “marauders.” He mocks the German foreign minister as a “disaster.” He is as comfortable in the vernacular as he is reciting poetry.",
  "He remains the country’s most popular politician and is poised to seek re-election, possibly this year, with polling showing him with over 40 percent support.",
  "Much of that appeal can be credited to his ubiquitous media presence and a speaking style that supporters find inspiring, and detractors divisive.",
  "ANKARA, Turkey — As President Trump has his tweets, the leader of Turkey has his speeches.",
  "Neither side doubts that it has struck a chord with Turkey’s conservative working class.",
  "He takes on his enemies publicly by name, pivoting seamlessly from pious to pushy."
