  "At an event sponsored by the Center for the National Interest, the Republican presidential frontrunner delivered a 5,000-word speech touching on his criticisms of the Obama administration's approach to national security, the need to whip US allies into shape, and promised that he alone can restore what he described as the lost standing of the US in world affairs.",
  "The general incoherence of the speech was pointed out by many experienced foreign policy analysts and reporters across the ideological spectrum, including Julia Ioffe at Foreign Policy, Peter Beinart at The Atlantic, and Max Boot of the Center on Foreign Relations.",
  "\"I look forward to hearing more details, but in a year where angry rhetoric has defined the presidential race on both sides of the aisle, it is my hope that candidates in both parties will begin focusing not only on the problems we face but on solutions,\" he wrote.",

  "Dan Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular Washington Post columnist, said that despite his previous criticism of Trump on national security grounds, he tuned in to the speech.",
  "After cataloguing a raft of Trump's contradictions and misapprehensions in the billionaire's remarks, he wrote, \"Trump doesn't really have any useful ideas or strategies to offer for how to improve American foreign policy.\"",
  "\"The central motif, like all of Mr. Trump's political thought, is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and temperament.\"",

  "Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, surprised many people by declaring the speech a \"great step in the right direction\" that was \"full of substance.\"",
  "Writing for the Washington Examiner, Kelly Riddell was quite indignant about all the pundits and experts pointing out that Trump's speech was, from a policy perspective, a mess.",
  "But outside the echo chamber of Trump's inner circle and the mogul's own Twitter feed, it's hard to find many people who know something about foreign policy that were impressed.",
  "Without specifically defending it against the critics, she pushed back with a very Trumpian argument -- people who aren't experts in the field like what he's saying.",

  "A Trump foreign policy would eschew \"nation building\" but would still somehow promote stability worldwide.",
  "It would teach our allies to trust us again, even while making a point of behaving \"unpredictably.\"",
  "In a written statement, though, he seemed to concede that maybe there wasn't that much substance.",
  "Because obviously, Mr. Trump's message - and not theirs - is the one that's registering.",
