  "TRACY, Calif. — Last week, at a tiny airport in the dusty flatlands east of San Francisco, a red-and-white helicopter lifted gently into the air, hovering a few feet over the tarmac.",
  "“There are many things that must come to fruition before autonomous aircraft start flying people,” said Mark Groden, a co-founder and the chief executive of SkyRyse.",
  "Local officials spent the week testing this aircraft for a new emergency service, due for launch in January, that will respond to 911 calls via the air.",
  "But as this helicopter moves police officers and medical workers over the San Joaquin Valley, it will feed a more ambitious project.",
  "That black cube is part of a growing effort to build small passenger aircraft that can fly on their own.",
  "These include the 360-degree cameras and radar sensors built into the nose of the aircraft.",
  "It looked like any other helicopter, except for the small black cube attached to its nose.",
  "“But we are developing the technology that can take us there.”",
  "Today, the helicopter is flown by seasoned pilots."
