  "As Lawrence Wright has documented, despite (and arguably because of) the billions of dollars the United States has invested in its relationship with Pakistan since 1954, its government (or, more precisely, its military) has diverted US military assistance to build nuclear weapons; harbored Islamic militant groups that kill American soldiers in Afghanistan; sheltered the Taliban and al-Qaeda sympathizers (and probably Osama bin Laden); and gave succor to the AQ Khan network, which became a WMD Walmart for countries like North Korea, Libya, and Iran that were shopping around for equipment and expertise on how to build nuclear weapons.",
  "It is more often Washington that performs the awkward gymnastics, bending over backward to keep relations smooth and assistance flowing\n\nAnd in Yemen, this unconditional support has adversely affected important US interests: The increased violence and chaos caused by Saudi military intervention has empowered al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen and still considered by the US to be a dangerous threat to the US homeland.",

  "The US should focus less on making our allies happy and more on making them actually behave like allies\n\nAlas, 35 years into that experiment, in July 2013, the Egyptian officer corps overthrew the democratically elected Egyptian government and has since brutally suppressed all opposition to their rule.",

  "The US had a diplomatic playbook for dealing with countries in both categories: reward and buy off your allies and clients in return for their solidarity and support in the fight against communism; contain, punish, isolate, and pressure your enemies for supporting the Soviet Union.",
  "Rather than trying to reassure the Saudis, the US should be leveraging Saudi fears of abandonment — along with the billions of dollars in arms the US sells Saudi Arabia — to compel it to curb its actions in the region that are feeding proxy wars and chaos.",
  "Cold War legacy: either \"with us\" or \"against us\"\n\nThe better answer is that the Cold War created pathologies that have become deeply embedded in America’s foreign policymaking machinery, and particularly the priority it places on \"alliance management.\"",

  "In today's complex world, where most nations pursue cooperative and conflicting policies across different issues, the US should focus less on making our allies happy and more on making them actually behave like allies.",
  "Indeed, there is a long history of US allies and client states accepting billions of dollars in American military and economic largesse only to pursue policies against US interests or carp about American unreliability.",
  "Egypt supports US efforts to broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, but prosecutes US-funded NGO workers, including the son of the US secretary of transportation, for trying to promote democracy in Egypt.",
  "When it came to relations with our allies, what really mattered was that they stood with us in the broader conflict — everything else was easily forgiven or not even noticed in the name of maintaining the alliance.",
  "Qatar hosts an American air base that is critical in the fight against ISIS, but actively undermines US policy in Libya and Syria, contributing to the chaos in those countries that allows ISIS to thrive.",

  "The US works with Saudi Arabia to maintain stability in the oil market, for example, but winces at its role as \"the chief ideological sponsor of Islamist culture.\"",
  "These relationships are rife with both cooperation and conflict for the simple reason that some US and partner interests are compatible while others clash.",
  "So why do successive administrations continue to provide massive handouts to America’s clients when we often get little — and sometimes worse — in return?",
  "But these defense industrial interests don’t explain why even American allies like Turkey that don’t buy much weaponry get away with these behaviors.",
