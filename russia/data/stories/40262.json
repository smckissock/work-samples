[
  "Quick succession of scenes that absolutely give me life: Cersei’s iconic eyeroll; Brienne’s pure, perfect contempt for Jaime; Arya standing up to the Hound; Hot Pie giving Arya the wolf bread and saying goodbye to her and Gendry.",
  "Jojen’s vision of Jon being on the wrong side of the wall, and surrounded by enemies, could apply to his situation here, but it could also be foreshadowing what’s going to happen in Season 7.",
  "“He would see this country burn, if he could be king of the ashes.” OK, we definitely need to see Varys and Littlefinger go head to head before this thing is over.",
  "It breaks my heart that Gendry joined the Brotherhood so he wouldn't be sold anymore, and that’s exactly what they did to him the first chance they got.",
  "It hurts my heart that she will never know in the show - unless they do Lady Stoneheart after all, which at this stage looks extremely unlikely.",
  "“They said you’d lost your nose, but it’s not as gruesome as all that.” Nice nod to the books and the fact they changed Tyrion’s fate on screen.",
  "“How many lives have you saved?” “Half a million… the population of King’s Landing.” See, this is such an important part of Jaime’s character.",
  "Jaime trying to piss Brienne off, and bitching about his foot corns to distract her so he can steal her sword, is my favourite kind of Jaime.",
  "“He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.” Dany really takes after her dad, hey.",
  "Another perfect Olenna Tyrell scene, pointing out the fucked up family dynamics thanks to the arranged marriages with the Lannisters.",
  "“Tell the old man he smells of piss.” Because of this line, every time Jorah is on screen, I can’t help but think he probably stinks.",
  "These shots of Bran climbing and falling in his dream, which directly mirror what happened to him in Season 1, are hurting my heart.",
  "That shot of Jaime lying in the mud, caked in filth, with his dead hand next to his head, is so horrific but also kind of amazing.",
  "Sam holding his ground and fighting this White Walker - and actually running towards danger - is such great character development.",
  "Especially because it’s taking place in the Sept, where Cersei will wipe out the Tyrells just as her father wiped out the Reynes.",
  "This scene where Dany pulls her bait-and-switch and goes all “dracarys” on the masters is one of my faves in the whole damn show.",
  "This rat cook story connecting with what the Freys have just done, and foreshadowing what Arya will later do, is so damn good.",
  "Yara going to rescue Theon is so good, although the triumph is dampened slightly when you know she wasn’t exactly successful.",
  "Seeing Sam and Bran exchanging knowledge here makes me excited that they might do it again in Season 7 (*cough*R+L=J*cough*).",
  "“You waste time trying to get people to love you, you’ll end up the most popular dead man in town.” Great advice from Bronn.",
  "“The Lord of Light isn’t done with you yet.” I can’t wait to see the Hound fuck shit up with the Brotherhood in Season 7.",
  "So Thoros uses blood magic to light Beric’s sword, but it doesn’t look like that’s what happens in the Season 7 trailer.",
  "“I heard a voice answer his call… I dream of the voice from the flames.” I really, really want to know what Varys heard.",
  "If he ever rows back into the plot, it sure will be interesting to see how he reacts to Melisandre and the Brotherhood.",
  "Ned judged Jaime so harshly for choosing his family over his duty, and then went ahead and did the same thing himself.",
  "The Hound is calling the Brotherhood out for deserting their posts and running away, and that’s literally what he did.",
  "Oh fuck, all of Bran's scenes are gonna be brutal this season, because literally everyone around him is now dead.",
  "“Will you come with me one day to Volantis?” “I will, I promise.” Robb’s nickname should be Oathbreaker.. 174.",
  "“If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start.” Saving that line for future fights.",
  "I like the similarity between Jon and Arya in these scenes - both of them refusing to kill innocent men.",
  "Olenna challenging Tywin’s homophobia and throwing the twincest thing back in his face is so damn good.",
  "And it’s that dawn shot from Bran’s vision in Season 6, followed by Sam running from the White Walkers.",
  "“You’re not gonna die for one of them.” Imagine if Tormund dies for Jon after saying that to Ygritte.",
  "Cutting to Jon and Ygritte is so jarring after that scene, but also I needed something a bit lighter.",
  "Sansa actually thinking she can invite her family to the wedding shows how truly naive she still is.",
  "I love this scene with Catelyn and Talisa, especially the way it fleshes out Cat’s history with Jon.",
  "Maybe it’s the fact he’s actually interacting with his family, when I know he won’t see them again.",
  "This sausage scene with Ramsay is both horrific and kinda funny, which makes it even more horrific.",
  "“If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.” @ me next time, Ramsay.",
  "This goddamn show takes me from wanting to vomit, to grinning like a fool, in a matter of minutes.",
  "I think when Tywin says “since I can’t prove that you’re not mine”, he’s just being an arsehole.",
  "That hurts, knowing that Tyrion is the one who strangles Shae after finding her in Tywin’s bed.",
  "Dany is saying she doesn’t want to wait for her dragons to fully grow before invading Westeros.",
  "I don’t really get why people thought it was SO out of character for him to sacrifice Shireen.",
  "Wait so the warlocks of Qarth are still going after Dany here, but this gets totally dropped.",
  "“Always the artists.” I hope we find out more about the White Walker’s artistic inclinations.",
  "The Lord of Light demands it.” No offense, but the Lord of Light sounds like a bit of a dick.",
  "Meanwhile Jaime talking about all the wildfire beneath the Sept of Baelor is fucking me up.",
  "“Just once in my life, before it’s over, I want to know what it’s like to serve with pride.",
  "This scene with Robb and Talisa discussing naming their baby Ned has officially done me in.",
  "Sansa’s “sheep shift” story is yet another example of how innocent and naive she still is.",
  "OK, I get the Night’s Watch fought the wights, but there were White Walkers in that horde.",
  "I love how Melisandre blames Stannis’ failure at Blackwater on the fact she wasn’t there.",
  "This blue outfit Dany is wearing is probably her most iconic next to her Dothraki outfit.",
  "Meanwhile Brienne, my queen, is actually fighting a bear with a wooden sword like a boss.",
  "Although he doesn’t want to leave King’s Landing, either - I get her being angry at that.",
  "Classic GRRM, give him the heroes arc, let him win all the battles, then unravel it all.",
  "I love how smug Cersei is, only for Tywin to totally pull the rug out from beneath her.",
  "And it’s a nice demonstration of Ygritte’s bow skills, which will be significant later.",
  "I love fan theories, but I don’t really buy the one that Tyrion is a secret Targaryen.",
  "If anyone needs me, I’ll just be over here in the fetal position, sobbing my guts out.",
  "There goes Bran, heading north of the Wall, where he’ll be for the next three seasons.",
  "But also I feel like this is the last time I enjoyed her plot for a good two seasons.",
  "Given where we started.” Yeah but Ros, just wait ‘til you see where you and Shae end.",
  "They really set our expectations too high only to give us basically NOTHING later on.",
  "“You’re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.” JUST YOU WAIT, DAVOS.",
  "Shae getting so pissed off at Tyrion for having to marry Sansa is kinda ridiculous.",
  "“People are loyal when it suits them and kill when it suits them.” Too bloody true.",
  "Accusing Ser Meryn Trant of being better at beating little girls than fighting men.",
  "Lololol @ Jon kneeling for Tormund because he thinks he’s the King Beyond the Wall.",
  "If you pause here, you can actually pinpoint the second Jorah’s heart rips in half.",
  "“I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.” Mance has already nailed Jon.",
  "I see you Jorah, trying to suss out how much Barristan knows about your betrayal.",
  "I wonder if Dany will discover all those fetuses at Dragonstone and be like, WTF?",
  "How does Gendry not realise by now he was more than just some Fleabottom bastard?",
  "This scene where Barristan tells Dany about Rhaegar fills my heart with such joy.",
  "This musical chairs pissing competition at the small council always cracks me up.",
  "“How long has it been since you had a bath?” Oh god, they really would all stink.",
  "Or maybe I’m feeling more genial because of that Tower of Joy scene in Season 6.",
  "Cersei was right about her being the only one who would continue Tywin’s legacy.",
  "I’m so sad Sansa and Margaery never got to see each other again before she died.",
  "And so is Jaime resting his hand on Brienne’s to stop her picking up that knife.",
  "Like, I know they’re gonna be OK after this climb, but it’s still so stressful.",
  "There’s that intense shot in the trailer of Jon being surrounded by the wights.",
  "“I’m not afraid of you, little brother.” Hmmm, are you sure about that, Cersei?",
  "“Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.” Robb you’re joking, but you really did.",
  "This Rains of Castamere conversation between Cersei and Margaery is masterful.",
  "Meanwhile Jorah is upset that he has another old dude vying for her attention.",
  "“You’ll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.” Just you wait.",
  "Uggggh I hate Karl Tanner, the guy who leads the mutiny against Jeor later.",
  "So two Lord Commanders in a row were betrayed and stabbed by their own men.",
  "Cersei trying to protect Sansa from Joffrey’s taunts almost warms my heart.",
  "Share On more Share On more\n\nPreviously: I rewatched Season 1 and Season 2.",
  "Jaime riding back to save Brienne at Harrenhal is one of his best moments.",
  "Knowing Ramsay’s ultimate fate makes these scenes slightly more endurable.",
  "Bran got hit with the puberty stick two seconds after leaving Winterfell.",
  "“Before Winter’s done, everyone you’ve ever known will be dead.” Ominous.",
  "You keep your filthy hands off her Littlefinger, you treacherous bastard.",
  "This is a very emotional moment with Dany getting her first queensguard.",
  "And yet here I am, watching it, with a look of horror frozen on my face.",
  "“There’s nothing north but death.” You shoulda listened to Gilly, Bran.",
  "I’m not sad to see Craster go, but I don’t like this Tanner guy either.",
  "That death stare she gives the men who dare to question her is perfect.",
  "Hodor’s fear of the thunder and Bran warging into him is MESSING ME UP.",
  "To fight for someone I believe in.” Well, at least Barristan got that.",
  "That shot of his hand being chopped off is shocking every single time.",
  "Cersei’s subtle twisting of the fork as Margaery speaks is everything.",
  "I kind of want to see these two fight again before the series is over.",
  "I love that Jon’s first instinct with sex was to go down on his lady.",
  "Look how confident he is, talking about how Robb’s days are numbered.",
  "“You brought a whore into my bed.” Tywin is such a goddamn hypocrite.",
  "That shot of Winterfell burning in the opening credits hurts so much.",
  "I’m crying at them talking about the little Stark in Talisa’s belly.",
  "How can he still be siding with Cersei after she unleashed wildfire?",
  "She still just wants to marry Loras and have Margaery as her sister.",
  "Meanwhile Ramsay murders four of his own men for shits and giggles.",
  "Margaery walking through the Sept of Baelor is making me feel sick.",
  "And also that Margaery has been able to achieve what she never has.",
  "I know that’s not very insightful, but hey, it’s what I’m thinking.",
  "Poor Missandei, having to recite Dany’s titles over and over again.",
  "It makes her loss of that faith in Season 6 all the more striking.",
  "Tyrion delivering yet another amazing threat he’ll come to regret.",
  "It’s kind of jarring to see him with two hands at this point tbh.",
  "Tywin’s rocking that black outfit that Cersei will later emulate.",
  "I mean, she probably wouldn’t have been happy with Loras anyway.",
  "So Tywin is already plotting the Red Wedding at this point, yes?",
  "You’re going to be loyal to your woman.” Because HE WAS YGRITTE.",
  "Arya was so close to getting away and then the Hound showed up.",
  "I also love Dany’s line: “He was not the last dragon.” INDEED.",
  "I can’t wait to watch Daenerys torch this areshole slaveowner.",
  "Ahhhhhhhh Arya came so close to seeing Robb and Catelyn again.",
  "I love Gendry and Davos bonding over their lowborn childhoods.",
  "Brienne helping Jaime cut his dinner is very important to me.",
  "LMAO @ Littlefinger just sitting there staring at the throne.",
  "“I’m very happy… I feel like I’m in a dream.” Oh my bb Sansa.",
  "Is that just a plot inconsistency, or does it mean something?",
  "Not as bad as seeing Catelyn appear in front of him, though.",
  "Ah, the scene where Big Dick Pod became, well, Big Dick Pod.",
  "Soooo shouldn’t Loras still be grieving Renly at this point?",
  "The development of Jaime’s character is *Italian chef kiss*.",
  "Ahhhhhhhh Jon came so close to seeing Bran and Rickon again.",
  "(Although, in the long run, it ended pretty well I suppose.)",
  "Bless Tyrion for giving Sansa space on their wedding night.",
  "Although, to be fair, there’s a good chance they all stink.",
  "Oh this episode continues straight on from the Red Wedding.",
  "Boy, if you weren’t on her list already, you would be now.",
  "I love Brienne running in to fight for him, bound and all.",
  "OK, I am so much more into Bran’s story this time around?",
  "This mini Stark reunion in Bran’s dream is making me cry.",
  "“You’re like, a wizard.” Sam’s actual dreams coming true.",
  "Stannis wanted Davos to stop him from sacrificing Gendry.",
  "Also the way she says, “you’re a proper lover, Jon Snow.\"",
  "And in Season 7, it looks like he’s finally gonna get it.",
  "I’m so glad we got a few happy moments in all this mess.",
  "Damn I wanna run my hands through Robb’s hair like that.",
  "She’s already more powerful, where Joffrey is concerned.",
  "I hope Theon gets a happy ending at the end of all this.",
  "Of course Ned forbade the bedding ceremony with Catelyn.",
  "Gendry holding Arya back is giving me so many FEELINGS.",
  "Interesting how Cersei is wearing more and more armour.",
  "But it would have been a damn sight better than Ramsay.",
  "This is such a beautiful scene between Ygritte and Jon.",
  "Aaaand the Hound and Arya’s excellent adventures begin.",
  "“You were right the whole time.” I love vindictive Jon.",
  "Meanwhile she took so long, they’re now fuck off-huge.",
  "Although the trailer for Season 7 has me very worried.",
  "It was always my least fave part, but now I’m into it.",
  "“This war is not over.” You can say that again, Davos.",
  "“The next whore I catch in your bed, I’ll hang.” Ooft.",
  "Gonna say it every time: WE NEED MORE GHOST ON SCREEN.",
  "And it cuts straight to a scene of Walder Frey eating!",
  "I swear it gets worse, not better, with each viewing.",
  "You’d be m’lady.” Excuse me while I go cry in a hole.",
  "And now I’m laughing at Tormund schooling Jon on sex.",
  "Tormund sounds like he knows what he’s doing though.",
  "How did everything go so wrong for Robb, so quickly?",
  "Aaaand that dead hand around Jaime’s neck is brutal.",
  "Ahhhh I love these Jaime and Brienne scenes so much.",
  "I hope we get some good scenes with her in Season 7.",
  "They’ll protect you.” NO THEY WON’T, FUCKING UMBERS.",
  "Eeeeeeek this nipple cutting scene makes me squirm.",

  "This leech scene makes me so uncomfortable uggggh.",
  "And now Margaery is trying to school Sansa on sex.",
  "Oh fuck, I can’t watch these Theon torture scenes.",
  "It’s one of my faves but it’s gonna be SO PAINFUL.",
  "Wait, is that the boar’s head that killed Robert?",
  "This is all getting too close to the Red Wedding.",
  "“The cheese will be served when I want it served.",

  "He’s so cocky, believing money solves everything.",
  "I made a choice, and I chose wrong.” I AM NOT OK.",
  "If only he’d been there to stop him with Shireen.",
  "That look between Cat and Edmure breaks my heart.",
  "Fucking Edmure, look how much he’s enjoying this.",
  "Dany has no time for this guy’s sexist bullshit.",
  "Ygritte making fun of Jon gives me so much life.",
  "In Season 6, she returned to her northern roots.",
  "“My real father lost his head at King’s Landing.",
  "Margaery is a master at manipulating him though.",
  "Totally different from the last time he saw one.",
  "“Littlefinger’s not in love with me.” Oh Sansa.",
  "Brienne is delivering some tough love to Jaime.",
  "I mean, that just shows what a true hero he is.",
  "The amount of hope Sansa has here really hurts.",
  "Theon, isn’t Ramsay’s identity kind of obvious?",
  "“We will meet again,” Melisandre promises Arya.",
  "This was an important part of Dany’s storyline.",
  "“The Lannisters send their regards.” TRIGGERED.",
  "I love Tywin sending Joffrey off to take a nap.",
  "Your threats are amazing but you need to stop.",
  "And in Season 7… she’s wearing a terrible wig.",
  "I love this bath scene with Brienne and Jaime.",
  "This scene is some high school bully bullshit.",
  "You don’t do so well after all, unfortunately.",

  "Oh sweet Sansa, still playing make-believe.",
  "You are no king of mine.” Goddammit, Robb.",
