  "In light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the numerous instances of Russian interference with our elections via their use of social media, voters who see political ads on Facebook or Twitter may wonder why they are being targeted and become suspicious as to whether the ads they’re seeing are legit or whether they’re actually the work of some Moscow operative.",
  "“It appears a significant number of political ad buyers recognize that connected TV is perfectly positioned to take on that challenge.”\n\nAs ad-supported OTT platforms—everything from Hulu to PlutoTV to the Roku Channel—continue to grow, OTT (and CTV) will play an even bigger roll in helping America’s politicians get their messages across to the right audiences.",
  "That sums up OTT’s appeal in a nutshell: OTT advertising gives campaigns the broad reach and feeling of “bigness” you get from being on TV, but where traditional TV campaigns can only offer up targeting in terms of day part, OTT ads can be fine-tuned to hit very specific geotargeted audience segments, greatly reducing the amount of waste.",
  "\"OTT is a great fit for political because it has all of the appeal of traditional TV advertising with the benefits of digital targeting and measurement,” notes Frank Sinton, Founder and President of Beachfront Media, a firm that specializes in placing OTT advertising.",
  "The wave of activity around elections has traditionally been a boon for the media industry, and midterm election years, where the focus is on local races, are particularly lucrative for local media—newspapers, radio stations and local broadcast.",
  "OTT and CTV (connected TV, or that subset of OTT that is viewed on an actual television set) platforms also provide political advertisers with the benefit of shorter ad blocks, which have been proven to aid in recall.",
  "“With more than half of Americans tuned into connected TV, political advertisers must reach their constituents in non-traditional TV settings,” says Olivier Girault, Director of Business Intelligence at Telaria.",
  "Advances in OTT ad serving technology make if far less like that viewers will see the same ad over and over as they’re watching a show, or that a candidate’s ads will run adjacent to those to their opponent.",
  "Politicians who place their ads on digital and social sites like YouTube and Facebook need to worry about what content their ads are running alongside and how damaging or embarrassing that placement may be.",
  "As the 2018 midterm elections move into the home stretch, candidates in the many hotly contested Congressional and statehouse races are doing their best to get their messages in front of potential voters.",
  "With OTT, campaigns can get the demographic and geographic targeting they need, without having to worry about context or about the other two bugaboos of digital: viewability and fraud.",
  "OTT allows politicians to avoid all that—no one worries that the local weather report or an episode of Jeopardy is thinly veiled propaganda.",
  "According to a recent study from Telaria, there’s been a 200% growth in political advertising on OTT this year compared to 2016.",
  "The actual breakdown is pretty eyeopening: in 2016, the political ad spending breakdown was: 80% display, 19% mobile and 1% CTV.",
  "They’re looking achieve a variety of goals, from convincing people to vote for them, to reminding them to show up at the polls.",
  "But this year there’s been a new player added to the mix and its presence is likely to get much bigger: ad-supported OTT.",
  "The final piece of the equation for OTT is frequency capping based on competitive separation.",
  "Knowing that their money is not being wasted on phantom or nonexistent views is a major plus.",
  "It also guarantees that their ads will not become lost amidst a sea of pharma spots.",
  "Those latter two issues are of great importance to campaigns on limited budgets.",
  "In 2018, those numbers had flipped to 60% display, 10% mobile and 30% CTV.",
  "Which brings up another advantage of OTT advertising—brand safety.",
  "(In 2016, over 40% of eligible voters didn't bother to show up.)",
  "That’s a massive shift and It promises to only get bigger.",
  "Finally, there’s the issue of perception."
