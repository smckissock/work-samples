  "| AP Photo Warner wants to hear from everyone at Trump-Russia meeting\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said Sunday that he'd like to hear from everyone who attended the June 2016 meeting involving President Donald Trump's son and a Russian lawyer.",
  "Asked if there was any link between the meeting and Russia's attempt to influence the campaign, Schiff said, \"this is about as clear of evidence you could find of intent by the campaign to collude with the Russians, to get useful information from the Russians.\"",
  "The Virginia Democrat, helping oversee the committee's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, said in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he \"sure as heck\" wants to talk to Americans over whom the panel has jurisdiction.",
  "The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"you have now evidence in black and white that yes, the campaign was encouraging the Russians to give them dirt.\"",
  "Asked whether the security clearance of Jared Kushner, who also attended the meeting, should be suspended, Warner said he is trying to give \"all these people the benefit of the doubt\" until the committee interviews them.",
  "\"So all of this constant refrain from the president's son, from the president himself that there was no there there, that the whole thing is a witch hunt, these folks have been saying that for a year.",
  "\"But it's very bothersome to me that Jared Kushner has forgotten not once, not twice, but three times to put down this information,\" he said.",
  "And we need information from the companies, as well as we need to look into the activities of some of the Trump digital campaign activities.\"",
  "\"But it's very bothersome to me that Jared Kushner has forgotten not once, not twice, but three times to put down this information,\" he says.",
  "Yet over a year ago we know they had clear evidence as well that there was a Russian government effort to undermine Clinton and help Trump.\"",
  "Warner said he'd also like to look into the activities of the Trump campaign's digital team and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016.",
  "In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Warner said \"all of these denials over the past year really are now put in doubt.\"",
  "\"The ability to manipulate these search engines and some of these social media platforms is real,\" he said.",
  "\"Whether we will be able to get the Russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question.\"",
