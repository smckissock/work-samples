  "/ Updated By Associated Press\n\nMOSCOW — Warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition operating over Syrian government-controlled areas west of the Euphrates River will be tracked as potential targets, Russia's Defense Ministry said Monday, a day after the U.S. military shot down a Syrian air force jet.",
  "The downing of the warplane — the first time in the conflict that the U.S. has shot down a Syrian jet — came as Iran fired several ballistic missiles at ISIS positions in eastern Syria in retaliation for two attacks by the extremists in Tehran earlier this month that killed 17 people.",
  "But in April, Russia briefly suspended a hotline intended to prevent midair incidents with the U.S. over Syria after the American military fired 59 missiles at a Syrian air base following a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on the Assad government.",
  "Ozerov insisted that Russia will be tracking the coalition's jets, not shooting them down, but he added that \"a threat for those jets may appear only if they take action that pose a threat to Russian aircraft.\"",
  "The U.S. goal remains de-escalating the conflict, but Spicer made clear that \"we will always preserve the right of self-defense\" should actions be taken against the U.S. or coalition forces.",
  "Moscow condemned the downing of the Syrian jet after it dropped bombs near the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that are fighting ISIS in Syria's increasingly complicated civil war.",
  "In comments to Russian news agencies, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov compared the downing to \"helping the terrorists that the U.S. is fighting against.\"",
  "of Defense via EPA\n\nThe U.S. military confirmed that one of its F-18 Super Hornets shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had dropped bombs near the U.S. partner forces SDF.",
  "Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the defense and security committee at the upper chamber of Russian parliament, described the Defense Ministry's statement as a warning.",
  "The Russians appear to want to avoid further U.S. targeting of Syrian warplanes or ground troops that have come under U.S. attack in eastern Syria recently.",
  "Those forces, which are aligned with the U.S. in the campaign against ISIS, warned Syrian government troops to stop their attacks or face retaliation.",
  "Areas of northern Syria west of the Euphrates were controlled by ISIS before Syrian government forces captured most of them in recent months.",
  "Russia, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has been providing an air cover to the government's offensive since 2015.",
  "Moscow also called on the U.S. military to provide a full accounting of why it decided to shoot down the Syrian Su-22.",
