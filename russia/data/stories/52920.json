  "This is consistent with what we have been saying all along.”\n\nGiven Trump’s history of emphatically insisting there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia, the modifier knowing before involvement is perhaps noteworthy, especially given that the indictment mentions that Guccifer 2.0 communicated with “a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.” That person is clearly longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; Stone says he did not believe at the time that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian-operated account, though there are reasons to doubt his story.",

  "Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.” On Thursday, Trump said that he would raise the issue during the Helsinki meeting: “What am I going to do?",
