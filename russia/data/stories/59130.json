  "JARRETT: Jeff Sessions who recused himself, you may recall, in his confirmation hearing from anything related to Hillary Clinton, he said it not once or twice but three times, can still appoint a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton over uranium one, her interference on behalf of UBS, with the IRS, and received an enormous amount of money to Bill Clinton and their foundation.",
  "Now, according to this new report, the Obama administration actually granted a temporary work visa to this top Russian official in 2011 and then they renewed it in 2014, even after there was overwhelming evidence this official was involved in a criminal scheme that involved racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering.",
  "HANNITY: Why would you ever, especially in light of everything the media and Democrats have been saying about hostile actors, Vladimir Putin, who in their right mind would give Vladimir Putin 20 percent of America's uranium and all the money that floats back, it stunk to high heavens from day one.",
  "And as John Solomon and Sara Carter have reported, the informant helped uncover a Russian nuclear bribery -- as I said, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, money laundering -- criminal enterprise which began one year before the approval of the Uranium One deal, before it was approved.",
  "So, just a little bit ago before we came on air, Victoria and I talked and she was able to confirm for me that her client has information that Director Mueller and President Obama and other officials were briefed on this investigation in real time as it was going on.",
  "As we mentioned in our opening monologue tonight, House Republicans finally are opening investigations into this very corrupt Uranium One deal that compromised all of our National Security involving the Obama administration and of course, the Clintons.",
  "The Hill is reporting that Bill Clinton tried to get State Department permission -- remember, his wife was running this -- to meet with the Russian nuclear official while the Uranium One deal was actually being approved by the Obama administration.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nHANNITY: Here is a simple truth: All three of these guys they are inapt, they're ineffective, they have completely failed to deliver on the promises that they made to their constituents and you the American people, for years.",

  "Here with the reaction are people who deserve a lot of credit for digging deep, The Hill's John Solomon, Circa News' Sara Carter and an attorney I'd never want to go up against, Victoria Toensing who is representing the FBI informant.",
  "Now the entire Democratic apparatus, most of the Republican apparatus and all of the mainstream media, they fell hook, line and sinker for a Russian disinformation lying campaign to the American people during an election.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: As we continue on this breaking news night tonight on \"Hannity,\" yesterday I sat down with one of the first daughters and advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, for an exclusive interview.",
  "The minute Christopher Steele step in to Russia to start talking to the KGB, former KGB agency and started digging into President Trump, they knew immediately who was funding it and they used it for this information.",
  "Also tonight, The Hill's John Solomon reporting the Obama administration gave a visa to a Russian nuclear official even after evidence showed he was involved in bribery and kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.",
  "According to a The Hill report published last night after Hillary Clinton became the secretary of state, Russian spies purposely tried to gain access to Hillary, her top aides and the former President Bill Clinton.",
  "I think that this will lead to an investigation that will expose and finally for once tell the American people and Congress what actually happened with the Uranium One deal, how far the Russians are willing to go.",
  "And obviously, we want to see what happened to that inquiry, what information was brought to their attention, what they knew then, why they acted or did not and put it in context to what comes out since then.",
  "To announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile, but it's morally treasonable to the American public.",
  "It's the millions of Americans we saw across this country who are addicted to opioids or who have lost a child to opioid abuse, who have lost their job, because their industry can no longer be competitive.",
  "Also breaking tonight, the Department of Justice, they are now deliberating whether to allow this FBI informant with all of this evidence to testify before Congress about this corrupt Uranium One deal.",
  "How is it possible -- how -- that they never recognized giving Vladimir Putin and the Russians 20 percent of our uranium, the foundational material to nuclear weapons, a hostile actor, is a good idea?",
  "They all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons.",
  "The Washington Post first reporting tonight and Fox News confirming that Clinton in the DNC they, after lying for a year, helped finance the research for that fake news anti-Trump dossier.",
  "This is the same FBI informant that helped uncover the Russian nuclear bribery and kickback plot and reportedly has all the evidence of the Russian money flowing straight to the Clintons.",
  "Also tonight, Fox News is learning that senior Justice Department officials are finally deliberating over allowing the FBI informant to now testify and tell the truth before Congress.",
  "REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Seven years ago, in fact, seven years ago this month, I've raised these objections with the Treasury secretary who said that it would be fully investigated.",
  "And by the way, we have to wonder, if this new information is the reason why the group behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, is trying to stop lawmakers from accessing their bank records?",
  "And according to The Washington Post tonight -- I love to quote them -- Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC, they paid for that phony research that eventually became the dossier.",
  "Here with the reaction is the author of \"Defeating Jihad,\" he makes America great again and coalition chief strategist, former deputy assistant for the president, Sebastian Gorka.",
  "HANNITY: I want to go back, Dr. Gorka, Bill Clinton trip, he wanted to ask his wife's own state department to approve meetings with Russian nuclear officials, OK that is insane.",
  "Even The Washington Post is reporting and Fox News has confirmed Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC, they paid for the research that became the fake news, anti-Trump dossier.",
  "Now in addition to all of this, The Hill and Circa News are reporting that the same FBI informant also has evidence of Russians trying to influence the Clintons specifically.",
  "And another poll showed that he was losing to his chief Republican primary challenger Dr. Kelli Ward, who would have crushed Flake in a primary had he had the courage to run.",
  "The Senate has done next to nothing to help the president keep his promises or help the American people or help the forgotten men in poverty, on food stamps, and out of work.",
  "SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: When the Flake service to this country and this Senate is reviewed, it will be one of honor, of brilliance, and patriotism and love of country.",
  "Now, you may remember he drafted the letter exonerating Hillary Clinton before actor conducting the interviews with the key witnesses including Hillary Clinton herself.",
  "The bank that was paying Bill Clinton -- when you pay attention to this -- that bank was connected to Putin and that bank also had financial interest in Uranium One.",
  "These senators seem to be more interested in attacking the President than they are in serving you, the American people, the forgotten men and women in this country.",
  "If we have to take a few body blows and advocating for those men and women, I think everyone in my family and everyone in this administration is honored to do it.",
  "I care much less and this maybe makes me a pragmatist, but I care less about who came up with the idea and who originated the idea and more about the idea itself.",
  "Let's stop using the word collusion, because the evidence we now have is about subversion, it's about sabotaging the political process and it's about propaganda.",
  "It exposed how $145 million in donations poured into the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state, while she was approving the Uranium One deal.",
  "Now also, the House tonight is also going to be investigating the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI's handling of the Clinton email server scandal.",
  "All of this makes the Clinton campaign and the DNC tonight complicit in spreading Russian propaganda and Russian lies about then candidate Donald Trump.",
  "We've been lectured about Russia, Russia, Russia for a year that they wanted to get the market on American uranium and the sad part is, they succeeded.",
  "Now the reports knows that one Russian spy who was successful actually got a job with a major Democratic donor and actually was arrested and deported.",
  "That's the same document that used Russian government paid sources and made wild and completely untrue and ridiculous accusations about Donald Trump.",
  "They have passed 308 bills that originated in that chamber and of those 308 bills that the House of Representatives passed, the Senate has passed 34.",
  "But he will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending.",
  "And for all you never-Trumpers who were watching tonight, take a look at the side of your screen, they happen to be Donald Trump's accomplishments.",
  "If Republicans don't back this agenda, a tax reform, repealing and replacing, they need to get out of the way or resign or retire or do something.",
  "So, I have a suggestion for all you never-Trumper senators that are headed for the exits, people like Corker and Flake, you know what, guess what?",
  "SEN. JEFF FLAKE, R-ARIZ.: We must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal.",
  "Also tonight, the Department of Justice finally is considering whether to lift the gag order on the FBI informant at the center of those scandals.",
  "I did ask Ivanka how she felt about the mainstream media and their vicious, unprecedented attack on her, her father, and the entire Trump family.",
  "all they are doing here is standing in the way of enacting an agenda to help move the country forward, what the people voted for last November.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nREP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: We do have a witness who is a confidential informant, who wants to talk about his role in this.",
  "The House is also launching an investigation into how the Obama Department of Justice, how the FBI handled Hillary Clinton's email server case.",
  "Because the evidence of wrongdoing in both of these massive scandals is overwhelming, it's incontrovertible and it puts our security at risk.",
  "House Republicans announced that key committees will finally be launching investigations into this corrupt bribery Uranium One kickback deal.",
  "He was a member of the government committee that actually approved Uranium One but yet they had all this evidence of corruption and bribery.",
  "Plus, never Trumper senators, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, John McCain, they are lashing out at the president, we'll have a full report on that.",
  "If you work in the house that your dad now lives in, to me, I think that is one of the great honors in life, that you have the opportunity.",
  "What's interesting here is that actually, the Democrats may be unknowingly were actually funding a disinformation campaign by the Russians.",
  "And that is pathetic, weak, gutless, spineless never-Trumper establishment Republicans forces all lashing out against the president today.",
  "Now because this eyewitness signed a nondisclosure agreement, that prevented him from telling Congress and the American people the truth.",
  "Now, this is what people all across this country and all of you corrupt people in the media, you should all be angry about this tonight.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nSEN. BOB CORKER, R-TENN.: I was one of those that hoped that, you know, he would rise to the occasion as president.",
  "Through September of this year, the House of Representatives -- and I have disagreements with them at times, at least they do their job.",
  "Nobody wanted this information to be revealed and then we find out in April 2016, the DNC and Clinton campaign were funding the dossier.",
  "They knew it all and they still approve this deal, knowing that all of this was going on because of Vladimir Putin, and a hostile actor.",
  "But I think as the investigation moves forward with the House Intelligence Committee, with the Oversight Committee, with the judiciary.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: It was interesting, Jimmy Carter even said he never witnessed any President take as much heat as your dad.",
  "This is the Democrat Party, the Hillary campaign using active measures to undermine Donald Trump and the Democratic process in America.",
  "SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's the last scene from that great Tom Clancy movie, \"The hunt for red October.\"",
  "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of their brother and use it as part of your carnival act?",
  "The fact is, these people that are supposed to be investigating this administration that has done nothing wrong, they were complicit.",
  "Now, aside from Clinton having secret, top-secret, special access program, classified information, mishandled a felony on her server.",
  "You know, on the oversight committee, particularly my subcommittee, we will be focusing on how the inner agency process work in this.",
  "We are now closer to getting to the truth about what is the biggest national security breach and Russia scandal in American history.",
  "Now, Senators Bob Corker, we have little snowflake whiny Jeff Flake and John McCain all bashing the president instead of doing what?",
  "While you are at it, let's throw in the email case, because to me, as a lawyer, it's a clear case of the violation of the espionage.",
  "A notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such material behavior is a-historic and I believe profoundly misguided.",
  "At least, he's not choosing to run again because back in August, Flake had an 18 percent approval rating among voters in Arizona.",
  "HANNITY: You said something the other day and I thought this should be the attitude of anybody that serves in the administration.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: I am really excited to share with you a special project we've been working on for almost two years.",
  "Now, before his little stunt on the Senate floor, Senator Flake announced he was not going to be running for reelection in 2018.",

  "They can look into this also, the House Intelligence Committee can look into a lot of these issues, oversight can take a look.",
  "There's no way the American people can trust Robert Mueller to investigate anything Russian related, to be fair and impartial.",

  "Look, as an American, I think we all have to be lending our voice to the discussions that matter in this country.",
  "HANNITY: Now that the investigation, now they allow the visas to individuals that they know is involved in this.",
  "What strikes me is that Christopher Steele went to Moscow and talk to the Kremlin and gathered false evidence.",
  "There is either a breakdown in the system or knowing in willful decision to let this people into our country.",
  "And I think tonight in many ways is only the beginning of a vindication I've been predicting has been coming.",
  "That's possible and Robert Mueller is now investigating anything involved with Russia, how is that possible?",
  "Even The Washington Post is now tonight being forced to admit what we have been telling you for over a year.",
  "But I think a special counsel as Victoria suggested, it is something that I have been hearing from sources.",
  "HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, I've said and I will stand by this tonight, they sold out America's national security.",
  "In the cold war, the Soviet Union will be used what was called active measures to undermine our democracy.",

  "Tonight we will prove how we've been right all along and ahead of the curve and how wrong they have been.",
  "Well, we know the Russian nuclear official that was eventually indicted was involved in money laundering.",
  "TOENSING: Well, my client was told this information now whether the bureau was talking, I don't think so.",
  "And as soon as the Department of Justice, I hopefully lift his nondisclosure agreement and protects him.",
  "I am there to support the agenda and areas that I feel I can added value and that I am passionate about.",
  "It's a team, it's her father that got elected and it's his agenda, to serve him so he can serve people.",

  "Now because of all of the evidence of wrongdoing earlier today, finally -- finally -- prayers answered.",
  "Tonight, even The Washington Post has to finally begin to report what we have been telling you forever.",
  "The Senate has confirmed in about a year, since January, only 175 of President Trump civilian nominees.",
  "What other conservative values that the president is advocating for that you are unwilling to support?",
  "REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: Our job here is to get the facts for the legislative branch of government.",
  "But I think at the end of the day, the real people suffering in this country are not me and my family.",
  "I think that there's only so far that many of us can go, particularly with this type of investigation.",
  "They must investigate these scandals fully and they must uncover the truth of what actually happened.",
  "The only reason these people are now saying they are not running is because they know they can't win.",
  "For example, oh, that Donald Trump was in the Ritz in Moscow and he had hookers urinating in his bed.",
  "People that make it about themselves in their own agenda, there's a lot of opportunism in Washington.",
