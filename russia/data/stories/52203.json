  "Late last year the DNC denied the campaign database access after finding that a staffer with the Sanders campaign inappropriately accessed proprietary data of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign.",
  "The DNC said Friday an outside technology security company, CrowdStrike, found evidence of unauthorized access to the voter database from four user accounts from the Bernie 2016 campaign.",
  "The campaigns are able to add their own information to the database, which they use to target voters and anticipate what issues might motivate them to cast ballots.",
  "The campaign of Bernie Sanders has withdrawn a lawsuit accusing the Democratic National Committee of wrongfully cutting off its access to a voter database.",
  "Sanders himself apologized and his campaign fired a worker, then sued to regain access.",
  "The DNC maintains an extensive trove of information."
