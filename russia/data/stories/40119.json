  "Robot sees the deal with Ray as a distraction from the real hacks against global capitalism\n\nMatt: Yeah, I think he talks about a personal logic bomb and looks at the site, page one being the 17-year-old in a dungeon, because no one can be cool with that.",
  "Our hacking experts, in alphabetical order:\n\nBill Budington:long time activist, programmer, and cryptography enthusiast, and a security engineer and technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
  "Talking about criminal activity with randos around or with phones around is a terrible idea, especially when you know you have attracted the attention of the feds.",
  "Bill: But they also mentioned the Steel Mountain facilities in China weren’t hacked by temperature control, but by a DoS (denial of service) attack of some kind.",
  "Robot set the bar for dystopian hacker suspense thrillers, it’s also a great hacking show that’s true to the culture and portrays technology authentically.",
  "Yael: True, I just think it'd be easy to trace them to the HQ\n\nMatt: As long as you use no cells or burners and rotate locations they wont get traced.",
  "Yael: If they want to kill Elliot they should just get on with it but I think they just want to beat the shit out of him\n\nJen: They need his skillz.",
  "Then he mentions stage two…\n\nFreddy: That's the device Angela is supposed to drop…\n\nBill: …which is a logic bomb, allowing privilege escalation.",
  "Yael: I think they should come up with something like having tons of clocks everywhere, just so people will be able to wander into their squat.",
  "Freddy: This is a weird thing about Darlene, she seems to be leading the people on the ground organizing a political program around the hacks.",
  "Jen Helsby: a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Chicago, and CTO for the Chicago-based Lucy Parsons Labs.",
  "Matt: Darlene is more hacktivist doing it for the cause, so she has a whole side gig as a LO (local organizer) of a political movement.",
  "Yael: I thought it was funny when Joanna Welick's acquaintance thought that his line was being tapped because he heard weird noises.",
  "Freddy Martinez, a reformed physicist who now works as a sysadmin and serves as a Director for the Chicago-based Lucy Parsons Labs.",
  "If I was an underground group trying to destroy the financial system through hacktivism I would *not* hole up in the enemy's lair.",
  "This episode, we discussed Elliot’s FBI hack, phone taps, dark markets, Darlene’s hacktivism, and squatting smarthomes, and more.",
  "That was mentioned in the last episode, the FBI surveillance operation on anyone they think might have been involved in the hack.",
  "When you're FBI in another country (yes the FBI operates outside of the US), you aren't allowed to carry a gun as far as I know.",
  "</speculation>\n\nMatt: Beijing backup facility the tapes were degaussed, so maybe some ICS (industrial control systems) hack.",
  "Freddy: The device was being left at the Evil Corp office where FBI is doing DFIR (digital forensics and incident response).",
  "Bill: Leaving devices places is a great way to get exploits past a firewall, like we saw in season 1 with the prison guards.",
  "Not that it would matter for the trial\n\nFreddy: So about this dark market, why would Elliot be struggling with helping Rey?",
  "Put them in a position where they can't off him, a cron job he has to continually disable or it'll dox them to the world.",
  "It'll increase soon to between 46 and 52\n\nJen: Also the original Silk Road did not have slaves or RPGs, for the record.",
  "I mean, unless it was actual armed Dark Army soldiers (maybe the likes of which we saw at the end of the episode?)",
  "Yael: If Elliot is going to keep poking around where he shouldn't be, I think he should learn some self-defense.",
  "Matt: I thought it was because the exploit/0-day didn’t work, so they had conduct an attack involving proximity.",
  "Matt Mitchell, a hacker who leads cryptoharlem, which aims to teach basic cryptography tools in the innercity.",
  "Jen: Plot twist: one of these people involved in their darknet market is a DEA agent trying to steal bitcoin.",
  "Bill: Which is organized from the house they drove the General Counsel of EvilCorp out of, by smarthome hax.",
  "Bill: I think White Rose set it up, since the feds wanted to snoop deeper than he was willing to let them.",
  "He also trains newsroom journalists, activists & human rights defenders in digital & operational security.",
  "Yael: So this show started with Elliot back on a computer again, hacking the FBI with his Android 0-day.",
  "Matt: Maybe people were more offended by that agent (Jessie) trying to speak Chinese than they let on.",
  "Freddy: I think the device is the femtocell which could lead to loading the APK into FBI cell phones.",
  "Bill: Yeah, I mean it may be that Elliot is trying to do to them what he did to Fernando last season.",
  "Matt: Well, I don’t know what’s the longest I’ve been AFK, but weeks or months-- I couldn’t do that.",
  "There is research on how to deliver malware using a celll tower; I think that's the reference here.",
  "Matt: Balaclavas and mp5s; I thought I was watching the wrong show\n\nFreddy: It was a bit realistic.",
  "Jen: They should go for a walk in a park or put their phones in a fridge and go to a private room.",
  "Matt: Well, the Dark Army handled the Chinese facilities while Elliott was the one cooking tapes.",
  "Bill: Maybe have a meetup spot within second life\n\nJen: Second life is definitely the way to go.",
  "The whole \"guns for sale, drugs for sale\" doesn't strike me as something he would disagree with.",
  "So I gathered some of the smartest hackers I know in a Semaphor channel to talk about the show.",
  "Freddy: I think Elliot is going to run a corrupt femtotower from which to deliver the payload.",
  "I mean, I guess if you're transparently proxied with a Tor network layer you would be able to.",
  "Jen: RPGs are fine because of the 2nd amendment - that's how it works in this country right??",
  "Freddy: The Tor Browser Bundle has a lot of security enhancements that Firefox doesn't have.",
  "Assuming it’s a magnetic storage medium, they used high-powered magnets to clean the drives.",
  "That I could see people being like, \"okay you're crossing the line\"\n\nBill: I think it's Mr.",
  "So the device Angela is dropping is meant to lead them to the Metasploit server, you think?",
  "Yael: So then let's talk about Elliot poking around that server and finding Silk Road 4.0.",
  "I mean they did get rid of a bunch of debt, which is good but does that change the world?",
  "Bill: I think this is what they did to the backups: https://giphy.com/gifs/Z3JJk5rR8fcd2.",
  "Which is kinda what her talks with Elliot at Mom’s table in previous episodes were about.",
  "Freddy: What I don't understand is why are they introducing dark markets in this season?",
  "Yael: Should we talk about how the CD and Angela's creepy ex who talked to the FBI etc.",
  "Just the kind of thing the Minister of Internal Security could set up, don't you think?",
  "When your company gets royally screwed, rebrand to cover it up\n\nJen: Blackwater style.",
  "Bill: The APK apparently has an Android 0-day, which connects back to a reverse shell.",
  "He wouldn’t need to do it via the browser interface and with that dude sitting there.",
  "Bill: They mentioned the person doing forensics on it got his own prints all over it.",
  "Yeah, she asked for the intelligence files on the group White Rose is working with.",
  "Like how they maintain their reverence for fight club, operation mayhem style team.",
  "Yael: Haha, but I swear I heard a weird beep on my phone\n\nJen: It's the government.",
  "Bill: Yes, but the Dark Army operation performed a DoS attack on physical backups?",
  "Matt: Like how they mentioned the raspberry pi wasn’t good for lifting prints.",
  "#EverySquatASmartHome\n\nFreddy: Update the Nest in the squat with your iPhone.",
  "Bill: He should have just been using Signal, wouldn't have to worry about it.",
  "Turns out you can't just bankrupt one company and expect the world to change.",
  "Matt: I am more of a frontlines kinda guy and having an HQ isn’t bad opsec.",
  "Yael: Give us bread, or give us white roses...\n\nFreddy: We need that pool.",
  "This isn’t 1950; you aren't hearing voices and feedback on tapped devices.",
  "He was coding it as a Metasploit module, which I thought was a cool touch.",
  "Robot is an \"ends always justify the means, stay on mission\" kind of guy.",
  "Like if your line was being tapped, do you think they'd make it obvious?",
  "Did you notice the feds were super excited that they found...some wires?",
  "I bet he was thinking \"Goddamnit, now I need to make this get violent.\"",
  "Bill: Everything had an air of pomp and circumstance, super diplomatic.",
  "Speaking of which, how bad is the Dark Army/Chinese government’s opsec?",
  "lol ;)\n\nYael: There could even be a corrupt Secret Service agent, too!",
  "But he should be using Tor browser, not OOTB (out of the box) Firefox.",
  "and Angela replies that it is at home (hopefully on) is an opsec win.",
  "Jen Why squat in a place if it doesn't have a pool, c'mon anarchists.",
  "They could have also barged in and wiped the drives by getting close.",
  "Matt: Tapes store data using the magnetic field to create 1s and 0s.",
  "Remember that long silence after Dominique asked for special access?",
  "Bill: ::cough:: whiterose ::cough::\n\nMatt: The gunshot ear ringing.",
  "Why does everyone keep talking to Elliot in his mom’s living room?!",
  "One reason the scene where Darlene is like, \"Where is your phone?\"",
  "Bill: So basically it's served on a webserver, delivering the APK.",
  "Apparently they're using Scallion to brute-force .onion addresses.",
  "It's generally better than real life, but the resolution is worse.",
  "Episode 6: Angela Moss Becomes A Skiddie\n\nEpisode 7: What Is Real?",
  "Freddy: They were very well trained, special forces of some kind.",
  "Bill: A burner pool, a feature pool\n\nMatt: Signal pool, Tor pool.",
  "They do have some 702 authorizations, which might be FISA court.)",
  "Matt: He had the keys to the castle if he wanted to poke around.",
  "So the DC Op seems to be some political thing they are planning.",
  "Bill: I like how he typed the URL into a plain Firefox browser.",
  "Bill: If there's anywhere I would put a mic, it's right there.",
  "(The chat transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity.)",
  "She mentioned not wanting to burn this location last episode.",
  "Like magnetizing a credit card or old school hard disk drive.",
  "Freddy: Ugh, there is a common misconception about wiretaps.",
  "Modern PDs (and FBI) use things like PENLink for Title III.",
  "Because otherwise without the politics 5/9 was for nothing.",
  "They didn’t mention how the tapes in china were degaussed.",
  "(Assuming they got a warrant, but with cyber it’s unclear.",
  "Matt: I mean I have a strict, never look at the data rule.",
  "Seems like a DoS attack wouldn't destroy backups, though.",
  "Jen: His scping files from one server to another skillz.",
  "You can help people without getting in their business.",
  "Freddy: The lesson here is to never talk on the phone.",
  "You could get the machine to erase the drive it holds.",
  "Bill: Oh at Steel Mountain, rebranded to Steel Valley.",
  "Yael: I have been to some gorgeous squats in England.",
  "Modern wiretaps are completely invisible to the user.",
  "Matt: Freddy is correct, you can’t tell by listening.",
  "Bill: It is the correct number of characters, though.",
  "Jen: Yeah they generated a nice onion address there.",
  "Also I like that the login was dread_pirate_roberts.",
  "And why did Darlene put some fanboy in charge of it?",
  "Matt: Nah its not bad opsec to use a squatted house.",
  "Jen: I know, that is insane; she is within earshot.",
  "The guy who killed himself rather than be caught.",
  "I think they killed everyone except for her, too.",
  "Bill: They're really hiding in plain sight here.",
  "Jen: Yeah, even the arcade was better than that.",
  "Bill: I think it's part of Operation Berenstain.",
  "Jen: Yep, move to Romania, use Tor, use Signal.",
  "Freddy: Nothing says late capitalism like that.",
  "Yael: As long as they turn it into a dumb pool.",
  "Freddy: So what’s up with the end of the show?",
  "Yael Degaussing is when the magnet is removed?",
  "Elliot genuinely wants to help people, and Mr.",
  "Degaussing ruins that by breaking that field.",
  "Change your name and then everything is fine.",
  "It's way nicer than any squat I've ever seen.",
  "Like wouldn’t the clock thing be a giveaway?",
  "Freddy: The RPGs probably came from the CIA.",
  "Yael: Why do they need her to drop a device?",
  "She also came up with this week's headline.",
  "Jen: Signal: available for iOS and Android.",
  "We want bread, but we want smartpools, too!",
  "Bill: In fact, I wouldn't hole up anywhere.",
  "Yael: I can’t get that URL to work in Tor.",
  "Yael: How is he gonna help with the DC Op?",
  "Matt: midcityp3cw5zldy.onion\n\nBill: Nice.",
  "Like, you can't just visit it in Firefox.",
  "Squat a house, wake up, lay by the pool.",
  "The grenade launcher and the oxy, meh.",
  "Onion URLs have (currently) 16 chars.",
  "Can we talk for a minute about opsec?",
  "Can you imagine how nice it would be?",
  "Bill: I like how you call it a squat.",
  "Yael: Where should they talk to him?",
  "FBI might have better opsec, though.",
  "Have people not heard of Silk Road?",
  "Jen: Wasn't that the Raspberry pi?",
  "Matt: Yup, big sloppy fingers it.",
  "Yael: He was a true professional.",
  "Matt: It was an awkward moment.",
  "None of them had pools, though.",
  "I would just rendezvous online.",
  "Freddy: It’s the EFFF BEEE EYE.",
  "Matt: Yassss, I get that a lot.",
  "Matt: Now you are catching on.",
  "Jen: Someone martyred himself.",
  "That doesn't make sense to me.",
  "Robot struggling with Elliot.",
  "Matt: Nah, that’s ridiculous!",
  "Paranoia is a hell of a drug.",
  "Jen: They're comin’ for you.",
  "Where's your opsec, Elliot?!",
  "Cell wiretap tech is sound.",
  "Ideas about what happened?",
  "Matt: Clocks are hypnotic.",
  "Yael: Let's verify pools.",
  "Yael: Is that bad opsec?",
  "I was confused by that.",
  "Is it the slaves thing?",
  "Skillz don’t come easy.",
  "Seriously screwed up!",
  "No pool, no hacking.",
  "Yael: Super awkward.",
  "I liked that touch.",
  "Touch of realism.",
  "Thoughts on that?",
  "Not only does Mr.",
  "No pun intended.",
  "Have standards.",
  "Hack the FBI.",
  "Get it today!",
  "A1 training.",
  "Run for it.",
  "I think Mr.",
  "Matt: Yup!",
  "Yael: Yes.",
  "Matt: Duh.",
  "Bad lab.",
  "ties in?",
  "Oh!"
