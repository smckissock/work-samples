  "Following the lead of other media companies seeking fresh sources of revenue, the right-wing news and opinion site is set to host its first-ever town hall in suburban New Orleans next month, a panel on privacy and technology with the commentator Ann Coulter and Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash.”\n\nIt’s an experiment for a site that has lately been confronting declining web traffic and turbulence in its top ranks.",
  "Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.",
  "The Louisiana event is “the latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,” said Alexander Marlow, the site’s editor in chief.",
  "News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.",
  "By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media.",
  "Stephen K. Bannon, the site’s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January.",
  "Breitbart News is taking a step into the live events business."
