  "Downing publicly name-checked various companies who worked on the Ukraine project — Skadden Arps, the Podesta Group, Mercury Public Affairs, FTI Consulting and Edelman — and suggested they got lenient treatment from the government while Manafort was hit with a criminal indictment.",
  "However, Downing insisted that the issue was a legitimate one because some of the charges Manafort faces relate to his failure to register as a foreign agent in connection with lobbying work he did on behalf of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his political allies.",
  "The defense attorney said Manafort's role in the campaign was the only logical explanation for why he faces an extremely rare criminal prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, but other lobbyists and lawyers who joined in the same Ukraine-related work don't.",
  "He said he wants to show the jury documents related to the firms demonstrating that the government's interpretations of the foreign-agent law are vague and typically delivered privately, depriving people like Manafort of clear advice on when registration is required.",
  "Paul Manafort's defense team argued Wednesday that their client was singled out for prosecution because of his role as chairman of the Trump campaign — but the judge handling the case seemed determined to head off any such argument at Manafort's upcoming trial.",
  "The judge said she's determined to keep mention of the presidential race to a minimum at the looming trial, but prosecutors said it has some relevance since media attention to Manafort's work in Ukraine triggered the Justice Department to contact him in 2016.",
  "The clash of views took place at a pretrial hearing Wednesday in federal court in Washington, where Manafort is scheduled to go to trial later this month over charges that he failed to register as a foreign agent, laundered money and obstructed justice.",
  "Reprising another issue that arose at the Virginia trial, Jackson said she plans to bar the use of the term \"oligarch\" to describe the Ukrainian businessmen who funded Manafort's work unless jurors are given a definition of what that word means.",
  "Jackson noted that at the Alexandria trial, testimony emerged that Rick Gates — Manafort's business partner who took a plea deal and is cooperating with prosecutors — had at least one extramarital affair during the time he worked with Manafort.",
  "At times, Manafort's defense has pursued strategies aimed at portraying him as a kind of martyr for President Donald Trump's campaign — an approach that seems unlikely to pay off in court, but could help win a pardon from Trump down the road.",
  "The judge at the Virginia trial turned down a similar motion in that case, but Jackson joked at the conclusion of the hearing Wednesday that she might have felt differently about the motion if the defense proposed moving the trial to Hawaii.",
  "The two-hour hearing Wednesday served as a warning that those who worked in concert with Manafort could face further reputational damage at his trial, set to begin Sept. 17 with jury selection and opening arguments following a week later.",
  "Much of Wednesday's hearing was devoted to relitigating issues that came up at Manafort's recent trial in Alexandria, Virginia that ended with his conviction on eight counts of bank and tax fraud and a jury deadlocking on 10 other counts.",
  "It seems logical that prosecutors would reconsider Gates' role as a witness given that a juror who spoke to news outlets after the Virginia trial said the jury unanimously agreed to disregard his testimony because they did not trust it.",
  "She said she'll permit a brief reference to Manafort's role leading Trump's 2016 bid for the White House, but she suggested the mention might be as vague as to note that he was \"working on a presidential campaign.\"",
  "Jackson said she would allow testimony about Gates' spending, financial transfers and any \"irregularities,\" but she said the infidelity issue will be off limits and Gates should also be told to avoid it.",
  "The judge in Alexandria initially barred questioning on the subject, but when Downing asked Gates about a \"secret life\" he was living, the former Manafort ally and co-defendant confessed to an affair.",
  "Downing insisted that Manafort's defense wasn't prying into the issue for prurient reasons, but brought up the \"secret life\" at the prior trial because Gates was spending money he admitted embezzling.",

  "Prosecutor Jeannie Rhee said the scrutiny prompted Manafort to craft a \"false narrative\" about his efforts and to convey that same account to the Justice Department officials who inquired.",
  "Jackson also said she plans to reject a motion the defense filed last week asking that the trial be moved out of Washington to Roanoke, Virginia because of publicity about the case.",
  "Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing said it was evident that special counsel Robert Mueller's office came after Paul Manafort \"because of his involvement in the Trump campaign.\"",
  "Jackson sounded skeptical that the issue was a proper one to raise at the trial, noting that selective prosecution motions are usually made to judges and resolved on legal grounds.",
  "Granting a defense motion, Jackson ruled that there will be no mention at the upcoming trial of Mueller's ongoing investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
  "\"These are all folks that were treated very differently by the [Justice Department's] FARA office and the Office of Special Counsel than Mr. Manafort,\" the defense lawyer said.",
  "Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing said it was evident that special counsel Robert Mueller's office came after Manafort \"because of his involvement in the Trump campaign.\"",
  "\"I don't believe that's a lawful basis for a change of venue,\" she said, adding that she wasn't convinced that jurors political views would automatically render them biased.",
  "Whether Gates testifies again at the forthcoming trial is not a sure thing, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said when Jackson asked him directly if Gates will be a witness.",
  "Lest his point be lost on anyone, Downing used one formulation or another to call Gates a liar on at least four occasions during Wednesday's hearing.",
  "However, proving the money laundering and foreign agent registration charges in the Washington case without Gates' testimony could be challenging.",
  "\"I do not believe this evidence is relevant to his credibility and I don't see why there should be any questioning about it,\" she said.",
  "Without some mention of the campaign, she said, the prosecution would have a \"gaping hole\" in its explanation of why the issue came up.",
  "Manafort has already been found guilty on eight counts of bank and tax fraud brought by Mueller's team in a Virginia federal court.",
  "\"I don't think you get to make the argument to the jury that you've made to the press and you've made just now to me,\" she said.",
  "The defense attorney said he pressed further because Gates lied on the witness stand about the number of affairs.",
  "\"You can cross-examine a cooperator up one side ... and down the other without getting into his marital history.",
  "The judge said she viewed the motion as based primarily on the political leanings of Washington residents.",
  "However, she also suggested that Downing may have accomplished his goal by raising the issue publicly.",
  "Jackson said she didn't want any testimony or other discussion of the subject at the upcoming trial.",

  "Story Continued Below\n\n\"That's why we're here,\" Downing said flatly.",
