  "Yes, there is always some onus on consumers to make informed choices about products and services they consume, but Facebook’s business model of ever-changing terms of service, riddled with the indecipherable legalese used by most platforms, and its general lack of information about data governance mean that consumers are often left in the dark about Facebook’s data collection practices.",
  "After news broke this week of Cambridge Analytica’s unauthorized siphon of millions of Facebook users’ data for political targeting, one particularly troubling reaction emerged: Some commentators implied that Facebook users themselves are also to blame for not being more discerning about or questioning how their data might be used.",
  "[A key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Cambridge Analytica]\n\nAlthough Facebook is now scrambling to address the data breach, the exposure of consumer data has serious consequences, and Facebook and its competitors cannot simply be left to regulate themselves.",
  "This isn’t simply a Facebook problem; it is also a feature of other platforms, such as hiring sites, which may be used to cull older workers through graduation dates, or customer relationship management software, which ultimately may be turned against retail and low-wage workers.",
  "One problem, as some scholars have noted, is that we have been lulled into acquiescence by platform surveillance masked as gamification — relatable and funny quizzes that trick us into giving up our personal data — and a lack of regulations to prohibit such data traps.",

  "These additional public functions make stricter regulations for Facebook even more crucial: Several lawsuits have recently been filed against Facebook alleging housing and age discrimination in employment.",
  "These steps can help prevent the loss of privacy and data autonomy in exchange for the opportunity to use platforms, such as Facebook, which have made themselves integral to social and economic life.",
  "The idea that Facebook might think that simply being “a platform” for real estate or hiring transactions means it doesn’t need to follow well-settled laws against discrimination is troubling.",
  "As a law and organizational scholar who studies platforms, I find the idea that users should bear any of the blame for the unauthorized exploitation of their data on Facebook outrageous.",
  "This notion goes against legal concepts that maintain that platforms to which we entrust our personal data should be expected to protect that data and not use it to manipulate us.",
