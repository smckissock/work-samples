  "In order to make the most of it, Bedoya thinks there are two types of questions that Congress can ask to make the most of the hearing\n\nThe first is \"the 'unanswerable' question,\" which Bedoya explains is effective because executives aren't specifically trained to respond to a request for a promise, and \"people promise things they normally wouldn't\" when they're under pressure.",
  "Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be testifying in front of Congress on Tuesday to explain Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and former lead staffer to the Senate privacy subcommittee Alvaro Bedoya knows a thing or two about how it could go down.",
  "The first will be a joint hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on Tuesday, April 10 at 2:15, and the second will be in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Wednesday, April 11.",

  "He begins by explaining that we shouldn't expect to hear undisclosed facts — Zuckerberg and his team publicized the worst of it last week, in order to let the backlash die down and read reactions.",
  "Bedoya took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to explain what we should expect from the hearing, having organized a number of technology companies' oversight hearings himself.",
  "Zuckerberg will answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the harvesting and improper use of data from an estimated 87 million profiles.",
  "Here's a guide to how and where you can watch Zuckerberg answer questions from Congress.",
  "But that doesn't mean the hearing itself is invaluable.",
  "The second is the \"request for a pledge.\""
