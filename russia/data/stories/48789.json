  "Although only 270,000 downloaded Kogan's app, there was a loophole at Facebook at the time that allowed app developers to not only see the data of people who downloaded the app but also everyone in that user's friend network, Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday.",

  "\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the Guardian.",
  "Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the Trump campaign.",
  "\"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.",
  "Wylie spoke to both outlets, saying he and Kogan \"exploited\" Facebook.",
  "Facebook should be doing the same rather than simply blaming others.\"",
  "That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"",
  "They've just really got to do better,\" she said."
