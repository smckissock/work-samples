  "Emails published in December 2017 by Donald Trump Jr. describe how an associate of Emin Agalarov, the British music publicist Rob Goldstone, wrote to Trump Jr. in 2016 offering material which would supposedly \"incriminate\" 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.",
  "Neither Agalarov is under United States sanctions which have been imposed on some leading Russian officials and business figures in recent years over the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and other matters.",
  "(AP Photo/James Ellingworth) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKRASNOGORSK, Russia (AP) â€” Ahead of the World Cup, Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov is reminiscing about his time with Donald Trump.",
