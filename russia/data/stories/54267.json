  "Columbus Nova’s attorney Richard Owens stressed in a statement that the company is “solely owned and controlled by Americans” and said that, after Trump’s inauguration, the firm hired Cohen as a business consultant “regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,” but that it had nothing to do with Vekselberg.",
  "Speculating without offering proof, the Avenatti memo said, “It appears these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Ms. Clifford.”\n\nAvenatti’s memo said the deposits into the account controlled by Cohen were made by Columbus Nova, an American investment company affiliated with the Renova Group, which is controlled by Vekselberg.",
  "Offering confirmation for more of the payments, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants was one of several firms it “engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration.”\n\nAvenatti alleged that the company made four $50,000 payments to Cohen totaling $200,000 in late 2017 and early 2018.",
  "WASHINGTON (AP) — Stormy Daniels’ lawyer said Tuesday he has information showing that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney, received $500,000 from a company associated with a Russian billionaire within months of paying hush money to Daniels, a porn star who claims she had an affair with Trump.",
  "A spokesman for Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, could not confirm or deny the payment, but said any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before the company’s current CEO took over in February of this year and have since expired.",
  "The memo, containing highly specific dates and amounts, stated that Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, and his cousin “routed” eight payments totaling approximately $500,000 to Cohen’s company, Essential Consultants, between January and August 2017.",
  "At the time of the payments, there was an active FBI counterintelligence investigation — which special counsel Robert Mueller took over last May — into Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates.",
  "But in a seven-page memo, Avenatti detailed what he said were wire transfers going into and out of the account Cohen used to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to stay silent about her alleged affair with the soon-to-be president.",
  "Making the arrangement even stranger, the blue-chip companies’ payments to Cohen were routed to Essential Consultants LLC — the same company Cohen used to buy Stormy Daniels’ silence about her alleged affair with the President.",
  "Lawyer Michael Avenatti also said hundreds of thousands of dollars streamed into Cohen’s account from companies, including pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T and Korea Aerospace, with U.S. government business interests.",
  "Larry Noble, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center, said there’s nothing technically wrong with companies like Novartis and AT&T hiring people like Cohen to provide insight into the president’s thinking.",
  "But hiring the president’s personal attorney for advice on how to woo Trump would be highly unusual, especially given that Cohen was never formally involved in the campaign or Trump’s administration.",
  "Trump’s Justice Department has sued to block AT&T from an $85 billion merger with Time Warner, saying it would hurt competition and consumers would have to pay more to watch their favorite shows.",
  "Trump had dinner with Novartis’ soon-to-be CEO Vasant Narasimhan, along with other European executives, at the World Economic Forum in Davos shortly after the date of the final payment.",
  "That’s unusual.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Jeff Horwitz in Washington, Jacob Pearson in New York and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",
  "“Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova’s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement,” he said.",
  "AT&T said Cohen’s company “did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.” Cohen is not a registered lobbyist, according to public records.",
  "But he said the arrangement described by Avenatti “certainly doesn’t look good.”\n\n“Why would you go to the president’s private fixer?” he asked.",
  "Such a confidential relationship would not violate federal lobbying laws if Cohen did not seek to influence Trump on the companies’ behalf.",
  "Korea Aerospace, which is alleged to have paid Cohen $150,000 in November 2017, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
  "The memo alleges the company paid Cohen $399,920 in late 2017 and early 2018 in four payments — each amounting to $99,980.",
  "He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14.6 billion, by investing in the aluminum and oil industries.",
  "Owens said any suggestion that Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Cohen was false.",
  "Avenatti did not provide documents to support the claims and did not reveal the source of his information.",
  "Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn’t been charged.",
  "More recently, he has expanded his assets to include industrial equipment and high technology.",
  "You’re going to someone who can get you access and tell you about the person of the president.",
  "Vekselberg was targeted for U.S. sanctions by the Trump administration last month.",
  "Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.",
  "Cohen and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
  "“He’s not known for policy and he’s not in the administration.",
  "AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening.",
  "The reason for the payment was not known."
