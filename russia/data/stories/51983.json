  "With the election just days away, it's \"critical\" that the FBI release anything it has found in its investigation into newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton, former Executive Assistant FBI Director Shawn Henry told CNBC on Thursday.",
  "And I think it's important to fill the gap with the facts rather than leaving people to their own device to determine what that actually means,\" said Henry, who is now president of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Services.",
  "The FBI announced last Friday that it was looking into emails reportedly discovered during a probe in which the devices of former Rep. Anthony Weiner and Clinton aide Huma Abedin were seized.",
  "\"Just merely that there's an ongoing investigation implies that there's something improper and that's completely against FBI protocol to talk about an ongoing criminal investigation.",
  "His company was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate and stop the hacking attacks on its computer network last June.",
  "That means even if the investigation is incomplete, because otherwise there is a big void heading into the election Nov. 8, he added.",
  "\"The vast majority of the American public, I think, sees something like that and they don't understand the totality of it.",
  "So to resolve that I think they need to come forward,\" Henry said in an interview with \"Power Lunch.\""
