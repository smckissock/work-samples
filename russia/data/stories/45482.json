  "These N.G.O.s and other institutions, Albrecht explained, will look out not only for “the one individual who has the time to care about his own data but for all those who do not have the time, who do not think about the risk, who are not a hundred per cent into these technologies, laws, and provisions.” But, even with these various actors, there is a circumspect note to the law’s aspirations.",
  "The provision is carefully safeguarded, because, as Reding notes, “what we do not want in Europe is an American-type class action, which merely creates business for lawyers.” Article 80 instead allows civil-liberties or consumer-protection representatives to advocate on behalf of the community or public interest.",
  "“With G.D.P.R., this will change.” He added, rather optimistically, “The power of consumers has not really started.”\n\nOne person who will be at the center of realizing the G.D.P.R.’s ambitions is Helen Dixon, the data-protection commissioner of Ireland, where many multinationals have their European headquarters.",
  "“The effort and expense is huge—big companies are easily spending over fifty million dollars in preparation.” Like all the other practitioners I spoke with, Halpert considers companies such as Google and Facebook easily capable of absorbing the law’s requirements.",
  "The main question now, she told me, “is how many simultaneous investigations can we take on.”\n\nAlbrecht and Dixon’s enthusiasm contrasts markedly with the pervasive low-level cynicism that many data-protection experts seem to bring to their craft.",
  "While they are not necessarily responsible for the ants in your in-box—except, perhaps, for the few clumsy follow-up chirps of “We updated our privacy policy again!”—they are certainly busy insulating their clients against the risk of enforcement.",
  "But it is also a highly individualized regime; the actions of any one person are unlikely to effect change, and so it is comparatively easy for us, as a collective, to yield certain concessions out of convenience, ignorance, or resignation.",
  "The law leaves a good deal of wiggle room for implementation and interpretation; although the fines far exceed anything that data-protection authorities have wielded before, they are likely to be levelled sparingly.",
  "“We’ve brought in lots of lawyers, communications staff, investigators—some from criminal-law backgrounds, some from regulatory backgrounds—and we’ve brought in business analysts, systems analysts,” she said.",
  "is the most contested law in the E.U.’s history, the product of years of intense negotiation and thousands of proposed amendments, despite its building blocks having been present in European law for decades.",
  "The law promises gains in over-all information hygiene: it will now be difficult for any large data operation not to know what data it has, where it is held, and what it’s doing with it.",
  "“In twenty years of doing data protection, I’ve never seen this level of anxiety,” Eduardo Ustaran, who handles privacy and cybersecurity issues at the law firm Hogan Lovells, told me.",
  "Speaking to me from Brussels, she explained that she had been concerned about “the big companies, like the American GAFA”—the French coinage for Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple.",
  "If you do, then the penalties will be very, very severe.”\n\nThis sparring rhetoric has galvanized a whole industry of data-protection lawyers, advisers, and consultants.",
  "“We’ve updated our privacy policy!” they cheerily proclaim, offering links that promise clearer information and better control over how your personal data will be used.",
  "One feature of the G.D.P.R., Article 80, seeks to address this by inscribing—for the first time in European law—the possibility of class-action lawsuits.",
  "“The Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, if it had happened on May 26th, this year, would have cost billions of euros to Facebook, among others.",
  "A few mention the cause of the sudden influx: the General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union law that goes into effect on May 25th.",
  "“For the last ten years, there was no chance to be on an eye level with the big Internet companies from Silicon Valley,” Albrecht told me.",
  "In preparation for the law, her office has been hiring at a quick clip, amassing a staff of a hundred people, with forty more on the way.",
  "The first, ostensibly, is universality: a common set of rules and practices that apply across the Continent and, it is hoped, the world.",
  "By and large, companies have simply written longer privacy policies—an excess of caution that precisely inverts the lawmakers’ intent.",
  "Orderly and well-mannered, they hail from the far reaches of the Internet—some from companies you know, most from ones you don’t.",
  "“Automated decisions that have a significant effect can be challenged and will have to be meaningfully explained,” she told me.",
  "was initiated, in 2012, by the European parliamentarian Viviane Reding, then the vice-president of the European Commission.",
  "You cannot hand over the personal data of citizens without having asked if the citizens agree that you hand it over.",
  "could be especially useful for rooting out algorithmic bias and other instances of machines getting things wrong.",
  "It vaunts two fundamental changes to the legislation that preceded it, the 1995 Data Protection Directive.",
  "facilitator Jan Philipp Albrecht, the law fundamentally challenges businesses that trade in personal data.",
  "Data protection is sold to Europeans as a tool for balance, equality, and autonomy in the digital world.",
  "“For large multinationals, the staffing can be three hundred to five hundred people working on G.D.P.R.",
  "As the law rolls out, independent experts and activists are hoping for more meaningful interventions.",
  "The second is enforcement: the capacity for regulators to fine any company in breach of the G.D.P.R.",
  "Even Halpert and Ustaran, who are more positive than most, struggled to say how G.D.P.R.",
  "Mireille Hildebrandt, a professor at Free University Brussels, said that the G.D.P.R.",
  "“It favors companies that are organized and capable of great expenditure,” he said.",
  "today is a far cry from the thirty-person team she inherited, in 2014.",
  "For Reding, however, and for her fellow-parliamentarian and G.D.P.R.",
  "“No data-protection law protects us from ourselves,” Albrecht said.",
  "There is no automatic right to sue for damages, but the G.D.P.R.",
  "But, at the individual level, the gains are less obvious.",
  "That is not possible anymore, according to the new law.",
  "compliance will improve the lives of average citizens.",
  "as much as four per cent of its total worldwide sales.",
  "They’re curious messengers, these ants in your in-box.",
  "The vision that Dixon painted of the Irish D.P.C.",
  "And you cannot steal it and just tell them after.",
  "“They just ignored the old law,” Reding said.",
  "permits injunctions to stop data processing.",
  "Piper, Jim Halpert, said much the same.",
  "Both are headlines only, of course.",
  "His counterpart at D.L.A.",
