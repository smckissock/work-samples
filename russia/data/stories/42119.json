  "Trump, who has been consistently and openly admiring of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has yet to levy a single sanction to punish Russia for election interference, despite the fact that Congress almost unanimously passed legislation that took effect on January 29 requiring him to do so, and despite senior intelligence officials testifying that Russia is trying to disrupt the 2018 midterms.",
  "JUST WATCHED Trump targets Obama in Twitter tirade Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump targets Obama in Twitter tirade 04:23\n\nSanders pointed to the fact that the Trump administration has continued measures begun under Obama, who on top of the December 2016 sanctions expelled 35 Russian diplomats and seized two Russian diplomatic compounds in the US.",
  "\"We're sending very clear messages to the Russian government, at the highest levels, that if they continue to take the kinds of actions that we've seen, that the intelligence chiefs have been laying out, this will have an extraordinarily negative effect on our relationship and there will be consequences,\" the official said in a briefing with reporters.",
  "Indeed, while the President himself seems unable to criticize Russia for meddling and unwilling to lead a fight to protect future elections, officials around him, more hawkish about Moscow than the President is, frequently call out Russia, with military officials in particular taking steps that are likely to make Moscow feel pressured.",
  "Since Trump took office, his administration has used existing sanctions to target Russians for human rights abuses in December 2017 under the Global Magnitsky Sanctions and for Moscow's annexation of Crimea in January 2018, when it sanctioned 21 individuals , nine entities and the senior leaders of two Ukrainian separatist groups.",

  "No sanctionable activity 'just yet'\n\nTrump hasn't taken a single independent step to punish Russia for its election meddling that's been publicly visible, not even with the powers granted by a new law, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.",
  "Democratic lawmakers point out that the White House itself highlighted another example of Russia's sanctionable activity under the new law just last week, when it issued a statement blaming the Russian military for the June 2017 cyberattack called NotPetya.",
  "Despite the consensus view of all US intelligence agencies that Russia did indeed interfere, and public affirmation of this from members of Trump's own Cabinet, the President persists in doubting Russia played a role at all, according to CNN reporting.",
  "After the Friday indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller of 13 Russians and three Russian entities for an extensive effort to interfere with US elections, Trump went on the attack against Democrats, tweeting in a spectacular fashion.",
  "The administration used its national security strategy to explicitly label Russia a \"revisionist\" foe that's seeking to change the status quo, and it recommended developing several new nuclear weapons to counter Russian activity.",
  "That hasn't stopped the President from pushing that line or from seeming to suggest in a Wednesday tweet that Obama be investigated for unspecified \"Dem crimes\" and not doing anything about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
  "Calling it \"the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,\" the White House said last Thursday that the virus \"quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.\"",

  "But CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the CIA has already \"seen Russian activity and intentions to have an impact on the next election cycle here.\"",
  "That law allows the administration to target Moscow's powerful elites and companies and countries that do business with blacklisted Russian military and intelligence entities.",

  "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump declared Tuesday on Twitter that \"the facts\" prove he's been tougher on Russia than his predecessor, President Barack Obama.",

  "In the lead-up to the 2016 election, when officials became aware of Russian meddling, Obama personally warned Putin in September against doing so.",
  "\"We don't have sanctionable activity just yet, but we are working every day to determine if there is something taking place,\" Nauert said Tuesday.",
  "Administration officials say the Jan. 29 date was not a deadline but a starting date for levying sanctions and that the process will take time.",
  "None of those messages have been delivered publicly, but the senior official said Wednesday that in Moscow, \"we are getting their attention.",
  "But last week, the administration had yet another chance to levy sanctions for Russian cyber activity and, so far, has chosen not to.",
  "But compared with the Obama administration, Trump is so far pulling punches when it comes to sanctions for election interference.",
  "Administration officials briefed lawmakers, and sought help from Republican leadership in issuing statements challenging Russia.",
  "Among his Twitter tirades, the President railed that, \"I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts.",

  "\"I expect the imminent imposition of sanctions by the administration,\" Menendez said.",
  "He added that if they're not imposed, the White House statement rings \"hollow.\"",
  "But as time goes by, Trump's failure to act raises questions among his critics.",
  "\"That is partly because of what they did in our 2016 elections,\" Nauert said.",
  "There has been no public action from the administration on the issue to date.",
  "\"Last week there was an incident that will be reported in the coming days.\"",
  "This official and others stressed that the process is slow but underway.",
  "That review, the officials added, began before Mueller's indictments.",
  "\"The sum of our actions as it pertains to Russia ... is not CAATSA.",
  "\"There are different kinds of direct action,\" the official said.",
  "\"He has been warned,\" one senior administration official said.",
  "Once we are sued, the entire sanctions process unravels.\"",
  "We have done a lot more than just CAATSA,\" Nauert said.",
