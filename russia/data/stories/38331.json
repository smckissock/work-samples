  "The 700 Momentive workers on strike at the massive upstate chemical manufacturing plant in Waterford, N.Y. — about 20 minutes outside Albany — walked off the job Nov. 2 when contract talks between the management and their union, IUE-CWA, broke down over proposed cuts to health care and other benefits, including getting rid of health care for retirees.",
  "Over the past 10 years, since Momentive was purchased by Apollo Global management, a billion-dollar private equity firm, workers have had their wages slashed, pensions frozen and other benefits reduced in a series of \"concessionary contracts,\" the union says.",
  "Traditionally the plant has offered coverage to workers after they retire until they turn 65 and are eligible for Medicare — but that benefit is now on the chopping block, the union said."
