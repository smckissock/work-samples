  "But in a letter, the Department, expressly citing the multiple law enforcement investigations of the company, imposed a range of conditions on the transfer of ownership, including extensive requirements to notify the public of various developments, a ban on adding new programs or increasing enrollment, and, most significantly, the posting of a letter of a $385 million letter of credit, equal to 25 percent of the company's most recent annual financial aid haul.",

  "In the past, the Department has required more than 100 colleges to post letters of credit in the 25 to 50 percent range.",
  "It is a testament to the dedication and sound judgment of the current leadership at the Department of Education.",
  "It could help reduce the predatory abuses at the University of Phoenix.",
  "The Department's decision is a big win for students and taxpayers.",
  "So the Department's action has extensive precedents.",
  "Experience running a college should matter.",
  "So the deal may never be consummated."
