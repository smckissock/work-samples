  "In an emailed statement, a De La Rue spokesperson said:\n\n\"We confirm that we are taking the first steps towards initiating appeal proceedings against the provisional decision to award the British passport contract to a part state-owned Franco-Dutch company.\"",
  "Eloise Todd, from the pro-remain campaign group Best for Britain, previously said: \"The new pro-Brexit blue passports were supposed to be a statement of intent and now we find out they are to be made by the French or the Dutch.",
  "Touted by the Home Office as a symbol of Britain's post-Brexit independence, the decision to manufacture passports abroad was met with outrage by pro-Brexit MPs, the Labour party, and trade unions.",
  "The decision to award the contract to a French firm was the result of a \"blind tender\" process under which ministers were not allowed to see which company had submitted each bid.",
  "De La Rue is to challenge the decision on the grounds that its bid was the \"highest quality and technically most secure,\" although it conceded Gemalto had offered a lower price.",
  "Conservative Party\n\nLONDON — British passport maker De La Rue has announced it will challenge the UK government's decision to manufacture new blue British passports in France.",
  "The company said it will launch a legal appeal against the recent decision to award a £490 million contract to French security giant Gemalto.",
  "Passports issued after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union will be blue and gold rather than the current burgundy colour.",
  "\"It has also been suggested that the winning bid was well below our cost price, which causes us to question how sustainable it is.",
  "\"We can accept that we weren't the cheapest, even if our tender represented a significant discount on the current price.",
  "\"Based on our knowledge of the market, it's our view that ours was the highest quality and technically most secure bid.",
  "Gemalto has not formally been announced as the winning bidder, but the decision is expected to be announced today.",
  "\"In the light of this, we are confident that we remain the best and securest option in the national interest.\"",
  "Strict EU rules on procurement meant the government had to open the process to all European firms.",
  "The Home Office stated that changing contractors would save the taxpayer £120 million.",
  "British passports are currently manufactured by native firm, De La Rue.",
  "The irony is unreal.\""
