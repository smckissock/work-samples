  "trump trump trump trump More\n\nGuccifer 2.0, the self-described hacker that US intelligence officials and cybersecurity experts have linked to Russian military intelligence, sent 2.5 gigabytes of voter analysis data compiled by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to Nevins late last summer, The Wall Street Journal reported late last month.",
  "They showed \"how many people were dependable Democratic voters, how many were likely Democratic voters but needed a nudge, how many were frequent voters but not committed, and how many were core Republican voters â€” the kind of data strategists use in planning ad buys and other tactics,\" the Journal said.",
  "But Schiff told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow this week that he is \"very interested in finding out\" whether there was \"Russian funding or support\" for the Trump campaign's data analytics operation, \"or Russian assistance in any way with gathering data\" that was then used by the campaign.",
  "The House Intelligence Committee plans to interview the digital director for President Donald Trump's campaign, Brad Parscale, as it continues to investigate whether any collusion occurred between the campaign and Russia, according to a recent CNN report.",
  "According to CNN, the data operation \"helped the Trump campaign figure out where the candidate's message was resonating in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, places where conventional political wisdom suggested they would be wasting time and money.\"",
  "The data operation Parscale directed was supervised by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now being scrutinized by the FBI over his contacts with Russia's ambassador and the CEO of a sanctioned Russian bank in December.",
  "A senior GOP strategist who worked with Parscale on the Republican National Committee's digital operations last year denied that he oversaw or was even aware of any nefarious collaboration between hackers and the campaign.",
  "Congressional investigators are now probing whether voter information stolen by Russian hackers from election databases in several states made its way to the Trump campaign, Time reported on Thursday.",
  "\"The questions they want to ask him are apparently some of the most basic digital marketing questions, and other simple ones like 'how would the Russians have known which precincts to target?'\"",
  "\"When it was reported that they'd be calling up Parscale, I knew there was a 0% chance that they had anything,\" the strategist said, referring to the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, would not confirm whether Parscale had been invited to testify as part of the congressional investigation.",
  "The documents provided to Nevins, who then posted them on his blog, analyzed districts in Florida, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
  "\"Jared got [Brad] hired, despite the fact that a number of people in the campaign wondered whether he had any idea what he was doing,\" the person said.",
  "At least one Republican operative, however, made use of voter data stolen by Russian hackers last year: Florida political strategist Aaron Nevins.",
  "Parscale's firm, Giles-Parscale, was paid a whopping $91 million by the Trump campaign, which famously shunned television ads.",
  "I had [campaign] deputies telling me they couldn't question anything the guy did or said, and they were unhappy about that.\"",
  "He is now the digital media director for America First Policies, a nonprofit group whose aim is to bolster Trump's agenda.",
  "A congressional committee wants to interview President Donald Trump's digital director as part of its investigation.",
  "Investigators are probing whether voter information stolen by Russian hackers made its way to the Trump campaign.",
  "Kushner, a person familiar with the campaign's inner workings told Business Insider, \"was Parscale's patron.\"",
  "\"If any campaign, Trump or otherwise, used inappropriate data the questions are, how did they get it?",
  "the former top Democratic staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, Michael Bahar, told Time.",
  "A top official said Russia targeted election systems in at least 21 states.",
  "Kushner also did not respond to a request for comment.",
  "Parscale did not respond to a request for comment.",
  "\"That is a crux of the investigation.\"",
  "And with what level of knowledge?\"",
  "\"He's Jared's boy.",
  "From whom?"
