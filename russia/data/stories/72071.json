  "I saw some-- reporting recently about-- you know, the Thousand Talents program, (UNINTEL) big intel collection, the Confucius Institutes, all of these issues-- and programs they have to help facilitate and supplement their intelligence apparatus is very difficult to deal with because when you lead the intelligence community and you go into the (UNINTEL) world or you go in the private sector to try to explain how these individuals that they hire are a danger to national security, it's a very, very difficult conversation.",
  "The Russian side of it-- again, I think Vladimir Putin has not been shy about his dislike for our country and what the democracy brings to the world and what NATO also does for us--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n00:15:02;25 And threat to him at home--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\n00:15:03;15 The threat to him--at home, right, and his ability to mind meld his own people are all about getting to the root-- of the destruction of our democratic values and ways and means as we saw in the election as well as our capitalist society.",
  "But most importantly-- counterintelligence countering the (UNINTEL) has really grown dramatically in the five to six years where we have acknowledged what you and I knew for a long time, but the whole country approach with respect to cyber being as a vector for these organizations as well as critical infrastructure-- supply chain, all these venues five, ten years ago weren't really commonplace in the space; they are now, and which makes it more important to look at it holistically.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, the challenge now is into midterm elections and to 2020 doing a, you know, really a predictive analysis what are they not only capable of, but what's in the realm of possibility for them and taking the Twitter and Facebook mentality and making it-- two years from now; it's really problematic analytically to think of what can be when they had the intent and the experience of success.",
  "So, I think at the end of the day-- the Chinese are probably a little more strategic how they would influence elections, but they're just as much-- interested in doing that for different reasons that we spoke of: maybe to influence a particular political party or individual they want in that might have a kinder, gentler feel towards a trade with China versus the whole we need to demoralize democracy.",
  "But how we get to a point, and you look at what happened last year with Kaspersky and DHS getting to a point, working with the inter-government agencies to do a binding directive was a big step in the direction that we need to take as a government and then as a whole society saying, \"Your product is no longer viable in this country because of the treat that it poses.\"",
  "What the Chinese have gotten really good at is the non-traditional, which is not those out-of-embassy jobs where they send over-- engineers, businessmen, students to do the same type of collection, recruitment, co-opting of-- information gathers that-- at mass scale, right, at mass scale, whether it be the student population engineers, the doctors, the scientists.",
  "So, I know you can't talk about specific cases-- but if you read the Maria Butina indictment, right, the fact that it was so open, right, the fact that she would walk in, right, as a Russian and try to influence somebody as opposed to recruiting an American to do that for you, which would be the traditional approach.",
  "And I think the insider threat will have to be in a global perspective, it's not only the Snowdens and the Hanssens and Ames and the seven people arrested this past year, but it's also that individual who wakes up tomorrow with a weapon who wants to come to work and do violence, right; the Navy yard shooting.",
  "And I can tell you looking back to 2001 and when I was in New Jersey-- comin' back from the World Trade Center site and we-- we had the Flight 93, which took off out of Newark and crashed in Pittsburgh, we began not only the investigation of the hijackers that lived in New Jersey, but the-- what's next.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nWhen it comes to, Mike, the critical infrastructure, we look now hard, and we work with the private sector and show them what happened in Ukraine and what happened in Georgia, and then how their scanning capabilities and their successes here in U.S. already can lead to that, right?",
  "We don't move it or enable that window to economic espionage or destructive capabilities in someone else's infrastructure, which is the difference between us as a civilized society with-- and the other side of it is we don't we need anything economically from our adversaries; so, we just don't.",
  "From a cyber perspective, they're very capable, they have a lot of intent, but we don't see them as often in anything other than critical infrastructure here in the U.S.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd have you seen any change in their intelligence behavior since we walked away from the nuclear deal?",
  "And I think if you look at China holistically, you know, and you parse the mosaic into not only the economic mindset, but what they're doing strategically from a military perspective in the South China Sea, I look at that as all part of the whole strategic plan of the country of China.",
  "It's a conglomeration of not only experts from multiple agencies, but contractors to help drive national policy on insider threat programs, what the minimum requirements are, what is a maturity model look like for your agency, as well as what are the best practices for private sector.",
  "And we have done that across-- I can tell you the four or five big agencies have done that-- to think about not only the possibilities, what-- what's the realm of that hypothetical look like, and then, again, juxtapose that against the intelligence we're collecting around the globe.",
  "And when we look at it from the U.S. perspective and in no-- you'll appreciate this from your previous position, Mike, we look at it in the U.S. as we're really bifurcated between the government, private sector, and the criminal element; that's not the case in China or Russia.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, one of the things you've been talking about publicly a lot-- that I want you to get to talk about again 'cause I think it's really important is-- supply chain, the risk associated with supply chains when it comes to foreign intelligence services.",
  "And they look at that from semiconductors, supercomputing, quantum technology that the persistent theft of our intellectual property and trade secrets, which is critical, the human-enabled cyber capabilities they have from insider threats-- we just-- the F.B.I.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo Mike, this is a good question, and we just presented our National Threat Prioritization Assessment to the president for signature, which we delivered to Congress, which lays out those particular threats for our country as we seem them now.",
  "So, they have the numbers, the resources, they have the will and the intent, the capabilities are out of this world with respect to cyber, and they're-- and they're intent to have a holistic mindset, whole-government mindset how to take from us what they need.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, there's an important link here, right, between the recent assassination attempt-- in the U.K.-- Russian assassination attempt in the U.K. using chemical weapons-- against a former Russian intelligence officer and the illegals case, right?",
  "But if you-- fast forward three years from now with the disinformation campaign that's going on, all the capabilities that the Russians are using on us, three years from now, maybe it's not that far-fetched, and maybe Vladimir Putin can get away with it.",
  "So, I think that success of those two individuals, I think you'll see the progress now with Maria here, that they realize that opportunity hiding in plain sight is the ability to work here in the U.S. with open society, and it's proved itself that case.",
  "That was a unique experience for me-- when it came down to Washington D.C. out of the Newark Field Office to work on this case where we had ten-plus individuals in the U.S. who were U.S. citizens who were really spies for the Russian government, right?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd then, Bill, the third and perhaps the most important final question here, I think, is if you were in a room with the nation's top CEOs and you walked through threats and they said to you, \"Okay, Bill, we got it, we understand.",
  "So, you look at the counterintelligence apparatus that supports those when we are fighting for area in supremacy in space as well as on land and sea and with the South China Sea, the intelligence game with China is very sophisticated right now.",
  "We've sent out some really aggressive collection emphasis messages globally the last year to really get to those case officers and analysts around the globe that maybe aren't in Moscow, but maybe they're in New Delhi or they're in South Asia.",
  "For us in leading the charge with the NSC and Congress, there's three particular sectors, Mike, that we're concerned mostly about: number one is the energy sector, number two is the telecommunication sector, and three is the financial sector.",
  "And the answer is have a holistic security posture, include the folks that you would not think of in your (UNINTEL), CSO-- your CIO, include your acquisition-procurement folks because I tell them, \"This is how we do things around the world.\"",
  "They will always look to find avenues to obtain legally here in the U.S. resources, whether it be Nano technology or any kind of technology that could be used as a (UNINTEL) technology to weaponize their systems in the military in Iran.",
  "And so you go do your mission, but we wanna-- and then once a year we'll bring you back in to say, \"How are you measuring up to the money that you get from the ODNI as well as the national priorities we set with you own core mission?\"",
  "So, we looked at hazmat trucks, right, hazmat truck drivers, we looked at Iraqi citizens who were driving hazardous material in the U.S., and we thought about all these grave things, well, if they would do this, what else can they do?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI've also seen you talk about-- you can have the best cyber security, a defense on the planet, but if you haven't brought your chief of HR in because of the insider threat problem, you're not protecting your company.",
  "You know, it's the only time that I can remember when we've been attacked as a nation and it's torn us apart, right, which is exactly what he wanted, exactly--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nAnd he knew--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--what he wanted.",
  "So, our ability to buy and procure and acquire the equipment that makes our businesses run, our weapon systems deliver, and our weapons work, there's supply chain there that we have not have fundamentally protected over time.",
  "So, we need to either not do that in the future, right, and only clear them when they need to have that clearance, or we need to have the ability to do that in 48 hours, right, because that takes the inventory someplace else.",
  "I-- although the-- we haven't had an official assessment yet, but we do believe-- that that's a tool they can use to maybe push the envelope with this decision to get out of that deal, but we'll wait and see how that happens.",
  "It's about a 60-foot wall depicting the history of espionage and sabotage insider threats, and it's with little bios and graphical depictions of each individual who betrayed this country all the way back to Benedict Arnold.",
  "They-- however, and we'll juxtapose them with Russia in a second, their-- their processes are more economic-based to be-- the number one economic power in the world-- to not have a global equal like us, but to overtake us.",
  "So, when you think about what industries are at risk here of intellectual property theft or of potential damage, right, from a cyber attack-- talk a little bit about which industries might be most vulnerable, most at risk.",
  "And I think analytically, Mike, when we look back it, did we think they would be as sophisticated as they were with the Facebook, the ability, the mindset to pose battles on both sides of an issue in a small town?",
  "So, they were here for many, many years under deep cover acting as regular citizens working our community doing spotting assessing of U.S. government employees and others on behalf of the Russian federation.",
  "So, I think the unique authorities I have vested in me by Congress is that, you know, there's three big constituents: the intelligence community; the NT-50, the federal government; and the private sector.",
  "And we said this a few weeks ago as we rolled out our economic espionage-- and cyber space report-- we saw a very slow dip, a lull in that activity-- subsequent to 2015, but then it just kept on moving.",
  "And then the third board issue is, you know, given the countries that are playing and giving what they're trying to accomplish, what are the methods that they're using that you're most concerned about?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nOr they're not though, because we have now-- I find it much easier, Mike, to be that person when you don't have to throw your documents over the transom to the Russian Embassy, right?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd one of the things that I've seen when you've talked about this is that you don't talk about the disappointment in not getting the job, you talk about the honor of being considered.",
  "So, there are a lot of categories we look at as being in the danger zone, but their ability to get up close and personal to critical folks, not even in the U.S. government, but in a contract community.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay though, let's step back and look at the various threats posed by foreign intelligence services and I'm gonna ask you to parse the threat-- in a couple different ways in a minute.",
  "So, we obviously, the intelligence community, had the same concern for those individuals here in the U.S. as they did in the U.K., and we do everything we can as a community and to include the C.I.A.",
  "And it's not just individuals who will hurt us from an espionage perspective, it's those--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, they've actually been recruited by a foreign intelligence--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nRight.",
  "Those three sectors we believe that our country must have resiliency, redundancy times ten in able to maintain our capabilities not only as a vital country, but a democratic and capitalist society.",
  "But until we get it-- the mind from the behavioral perspective of what the catalyst is that endangers us and it makes the individual go bad, we're never gonna be able to solve the insider threat.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, a traditional collector is that-- Chinese spy who's here on diplomatic cover from MMS or the PLA who's doing spy work undercover as one of their state department officials.",
  "And I wanna tell you, for somebody who was in exactly the same position at C.I.A., that really resonates with me because people would say to me all the time, \"Gosh, you must be so disappointed.\"",
  "They bring ungodly resources that we can't handle right now because they have-- for instance, just in the student population, there's 350,000 students that come to the U.S. every year to study.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nI think when you talk about the non-traditional collector-- I think we've not done a great job in the intel community explaining what that is to the non-intel community folks.",
  "So, I think both Russia and China are looking at our energy sector, our financial sector (UNINTEL) and the Chinese are very interested in our telecommunication sectors as we move forward to 5G.",
  "And I say that as we go through now, Mike-- when we are trying to reform the way we do security clearance processes and we're helping vet individuals, the first thing we're looking at is risk.",
  "When that is whether or not you're the intelligence community, but you're making something your Fortune 100 company, security has to be part of your mission otherwise you won't have a mission.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, we in the government-- I still consider myself in the government -- I shouldn't, but I do -- so, we do this thing called continuous monitoring, which you mentioned before?",
  "When we look at what we see for our adversaries, the Russians, the Chinese and the Iranians, what they're doing here scanning our systems and ICS systems are primarily in those three sectors.",
  "You know, we didn't see what the terrorists did on that day as a possibility, right; taking over aircraft, not hijacking them, but using the aircraft as weapons, right, we didn't we see that.",
  "hire a rockstar woman from a college at 25 years old, have her work in the DO or intel for five, six years, let her go out to Google and Microsoft for four or five years, and then come back?",
  "OPM really opened our eyes to the ability of our--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThis is the hack-- by the Chinese of the applications, right, for--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\n21 million files on U.S. citizens.",
  "We made-- no longer can we ask folks to think about a 30-year career; but at the same time, we have to find a way to get that 25-year-old to come to work every day without their cell phone.",
  "So, I would say from that perspective, we're more a policy and strategy organization, (UNINTEL), and we don't get into the implementation or the practice of how agencies do their business.",
  "And for your listeners, that's those individuals who here who aren't intelligence officers, who are engineers and businessmen and academic professors and such who steal our (UNINTEL) data.",
  "So, on the question then, and we've touched a little bit on this, but we can go deeper, is in conducting all these intelligence activities against us-- talk a little bit about objectives.",
  "So, when we look at the numbers-- and I would say for every single serviceman who comes on board and works in the Marine Corps and under our (UNINTEL), they're getting a secret clearance.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, you said something interesting earlier, Bill, when we were talking about threat to elections, U.S. elections, you mentioned China as something we need to worry about.",
  "Or do they take a-- do they develop a relationship like a traditional operations officer, intelligence officer, and actually make a pitch at some point, \"We want you to work for us\"?",
  "I say offensively we're as good as we've always been in the world, but we do it for the specific reasons we do our counterintelligence, counter espionage in that espionage spy world.",
  "And we look at China and Russian getting into our acquisition programs, they're not usually part of the enterprise security apparatus in the CI--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe supply chains.",
  "official-- and I don't wanna embarrass you-- but you're one of the bureau's best-- so much so that you were under active consideration to replace Jim Comey as director when he left.",
  "I can give a Boston couple and the folks that came here in to Alexandria in Arlington-- they were living on the same floor with very important folks who had top secret clearances.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBig part of your mission seems to be to get out, talk about the threats the country's facing from foreign intelligence services, particularly the private sector.",
  "My answer is it's-- they've already won because we have this conversation every day, it's on cable news every night and in the paper every day: Putin as accomplished his mission.",
  "So, for instance, there are some people out there-- who maybe have-- leaked some classified documents who weren't (UNINTEL) through the legal process who aren't on the wall yet.",
  "So, I think when you boil down, you know, the Russian threat to our elections and electoral process and-- what we have as a democratic value, it's an influence campaign, right?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nLast question before we move on to the third broad issue is-- President Xi made a commitment to President Obama that he was gonna stop this economic espionage.",
  "Number one would be Cuba, and I would say the island of Cuba because the capabilities as you know, Mike, with the Cuban Intelligence Service for decades are silent but deadly.",
  "But when you add the amount of Russian intelligence services now and Chinese intelligence services on the island of Cuba, it becomes a very problematic geographic area for us.",
  "So, I would say they're more tactical (UNINTEL) more military-based-- but their efforts and interests are to strictly demoralize democracy and defeat the capitalist mindset.",
  "So, when we see the Russians now using legitimate businesses in Russia to do their-- a bidding here in the U.S., that's the China model that they'd used for 20 years, right?",
  "So, I think we have to have a whole of government approach to not only identifying that hypotheticals, but getting intelligence in different areas we have not got it before.",
  "And we've identified is we'll get all these cases over the last 20 years, and we look-- could we've identified that the individual will have gone bad before we hired them?",
  "But I do see an incredible proliferation of insider threat programs outside of our community, across America, understanding that the insider threat program is critical.",
  "There's currently over 400,000 Americans who are clear to the top secret level that don't work for the government; one third of a population in the cleared community.",
  "There's no rationale in my mind we can't have somebody cleared at a secret level in a couple weeks, at a top secret level in less than 60 days, there's no rationale.",
  "So one of the things that just-- you said that resonated with me was there's a bit of a similarity here with 9/11-- which I lived through-- and I know you did, too.",
  "We see them doing it in Taiwan now, and they've had some experience not with social media in Australia, but kind of direct political influence in Australia as well.",
  "And as you know, to get our analytic capabilities and our offensive capabilities together, look at three different countries on a very small island is problematic.",
  "And I'll say the three areas that I think, to answer your question on the CEO aspect, Human Resources procurement acquisition: you have to pay attention to those.",
  "And I could see-- first of all, I'm gonna start this question off, Mike, with saying when I get to see what we do offensively as a country, it's amazing, right?",
  "So, you talked about China wanting to make themselves stronger largely through economic theft, and Russian trying to weaken us in a variety of different ways.",
  "To be considered and have that humbleness to it and the flattery of the hard work you've done, but also have someone else selected to do the hard work, right?",
  "And then we added a(UNINTEL)one-year planning operation for the take down and arrested those individuals, which resulted in the spy swap with Vladimir Putin.",
  "We found over the last ten years or so no generational issues, no gen- Xer's, no Y chromosome, X chromosome, no male, female, no age issue, no agency issue.",
  "Now, that comes with different aspects, Human Resources being number one, but the monitoring of their emails and capabilities is probably a bridge too far.",
  "And one of the Russian patterns, right is to undertake these kind of activities in their near or aboard, in their periphery, and then export them further.",
  "And I'll say that, Mike, not only in the government insider threat from our world that we've had in our agencies over time, but in private sector, right?",
  "And you can't fulfill that obligation unless you have a holistic mindset to how you're going protect that proprietary data or trade secret that you make.",
  "Now, the Chinese, when they attack our (UNINTEL) or look at our critical infrastructure or they do things, they're doing it because of economic purposes.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWell, this would be the music to the ears of all those recent college graduates who are waiting for jobs in the intelligence community.",
  "I think as we get outside of that defense industrial base, it gets harder for the attorneys to rationalize why we don't want to monitor our employees.",
  "and DOJ handed out on the GRU a few months back, well, they were spending 1.2 million a month on that campaign; well, that's nothing for the Chinese.",
  "And the Chinese could put thousands of those resources towards any strategic plan they had to defeat a particular candidate or encourage another one.",
  "They have a lot of resources they could throw at us, and they hit our academia, our industry, our research development, and obviously our government.",
  "The F.B.I., C.I.A., N.S.A, State Department have had a joint investigation on that, which is not yet concluded, and we're still looking towards that.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, I have not been to your headquarters in Maryland, but I'm told that there is a museum of sorts there called the Wall of Shame.",
  "But with the military-- usefulness in not only on land and sea, but in space right now, the competition with China is extremely vigorous right now.",
  "So, we should be watching very close what they're doing in places like Ukraine and Georgia and other places, right--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nAbsolutely.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, I believe, Mike, it's one of the core things that we have to do better at not only in the government, but as a whole country.",
  "You know, if you look at, you know, some of them that were actually went through the academy, they came there, and they were in true name, right?",
  "And what I tell people all the time is if-- at the end of the day, people can argue all day long whether or not it had an impact on the election.",
  "I think we publicly said as a united government that we have not found the evidence yet of actually-- what they have done and what they have not.",
  "The Chinese-- I'm gonna say the last probably eight to ten years have been really good at not letting that happen outside of their soil, right?",
  "And I think the folks in our business, Mike, are pretty confident what we're gonna find at the end of that if we can find the evidence to that.",
  "The second part of the issue what we call Trust the Workforce 2.0 is re-looking a blank slate of how we're going to vet folks moving forward.",
  "00:14:18;13 So, we are really competing against a unified entity in Russia and China that poses a threat to us that we're not familiar with.",
  "They need the U.S. to have a solid capitalist organized process here so they can compete and they could facilitate their financial aspects.",
  "is foreign and collects intelligences around the world-- and identifying the plans and intentions of foreign leaders in governments, right?",
  "I think the complexity of that indictment and how open it is and how strategic it was, we have to, as a society, understand this happens.",
  "to be that vocal point out the private sector and drive some of the issues and constructs that they can't because of operational issues.",
  "Out of those individuals that we arrested and sent back to Moscow, majority of them were, quote, unquote, \"Russian illegals,\" you know?",
  "And I-- we talked a lot the cyber threat, but what happens if there are Russian nationals or intelligence officers at a polling place?",
  "What we do for the community and the government, Mike, is set national policy and strategy for which we want them to do things, right?",
  "So, \"We would like you from a national perspective intelligence community to collect as many soda cans and glass bottles as you can.\"",
  "And I think that's the message I like to get out, but it's really difficult, as you know, to put why that's a winning factor for him.",
  "Understand that you have an obligation to not only your company, your board of directors, your stockholders to protect that brand.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, the Chinese-- two questions: who brings more resources to it; and then who brings more sophistication to it?",
  "It takes you betraying your country, whether that be--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you have to be convicted or--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYes.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, what do you think, Bill, what do you think is the most important lesson from what the Russians did in 2016?",
  "But let me start by asking you to characterize the degree of the overall threat we face today versus other times in our history.",
  "So, the bureau, obviously we'll say for this audience is domestic here, to protect the national security of the U.S., the C.I.A.",
  "If you look at what foreign intelligence services do to us, how do you compare and contrast that with what we do to them, right?",
  "We're well on our way to understanding-- we have to minimize all those crazy tiers and what we have at top secret versus secret.",
  "So, I do think there's an artificial wall between the government and defense industrial base and the rest of the United States.",
  "You have WikiLeaks and all these leaktivist organizations out here, hacktivist organizations who will broker that data for you.",
  "And I think-- to your point, they tried it on their own citizens, they've moved to near or aboard, and they exported overseas.",
  "But I would say not only more aggressive, Mike, but more diversified in how they attack us with their non-traditional actors.",
  "Russians don't need any of that, they're not competitors with us or anyone else economically; they're more (UNINTEL) mindset.",
  "Versus Russia, all their activity is because they don't like capitalism, they don't like democracy, and they wanna defeat it.",
  "Look at all the cases that are going on now historically; we go from the Myers family all the way down to (UNINTEL PHRASE).",
  "If you wanna (UNINTEL) about Snowden, you can talk about him being a leaker or whatever; he was an insider threat, right?",
  "But they're very comfortable using co-optees and non-traditional collectors to be able to facilitate those relationships.",
  "So--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nBut I will say, Mike, if-- let's think about your\n\n--who benefits for the U.S. not being in Cuba?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nOp-- yes, the Chinese and Russians operating in the country of Mexico and Cuba as well as in Africa.",
  "So, existentially, long term, they're the largest threat to our national security, bar none; so, it's not even close.",
  "post-9/11 is we brought screenwriters in from Hollywood and said, \"Help us think about all the possibilities,\" right?",
  "So, you have broad spectrum, which makes it more difficult to help identify what the rationale is someone to go bad.",
  "The ability of our advisories to look outside (UNINTEL) intelligence community for data that they believe valuable.",
  "And it really gives the employees of NCSC and (UNINTEL) for that matter a reminder every day why we do what we do.",
  "It'd be one thing that we find whether it's a voting machine in Alabama or whether it's-- a blackout in one city.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, the Russians have now done an assassination in the U.K., and now they've attempted another.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo we have any idea yet what was making American diplomats ill in Havana and then in China now?",
  "The Iranians are very, very sophisticated, and the utilization of Lebanese Hezbollah helps them along the globe.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWell, and these non-traditional collectors, do they-- do they acquire that information subtly?",
  "So, I think the ability for us to play fair is not only our best-postured venue, but it also hurts us the most.",
  "And I think-- and those are just the folks that we went through legal process on with an arrest or indictment.",
  "So, the-- our ability to identify individuals who can cause us harm on any given day is our utmost importance.",
  "But as we saw with the Sony hack, they're capable of doing significant destruction if they wanted to go there.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, the Iranians have been and continue to be a threat with respect to (UNINTEL) technology.",
  "So, we've-- started the process-- two things, Mike, one is reducing the extensive-- the backlog of inventory.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nAnd let me add, if I might-- I think we're also looking at-- I'll call it the 2020 factor.",
  "And I think-- and once we get the inventory down to a more workable level, we'll be able to facilitate that.",
  "If you look at just the last two years, the 15 or so people who have been arrested, all over the map, right?",
  "So, they have just as many tools and techniques as the Chinese and Russians, but just with different intent.",
  "So, to me, the value proposition for them doing it in the U.K. is not that far from here in the U.S., right?",
  "But at least they're now understanding they have to a fundamental understanding of the people the employee.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd we had the same issue with many Chinese companies--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThat's correct.",
  "They have significant number of Ph.D.-plus students that are here working our most sensitive technologies.",
  "And I think the more we have-- and I look at this-- Mike, as a juxtaposition of the environment we're in.",
  "And I think the threat supply chain we've hidden in the intelligence community for too many years, right?",
  "It's not just an intelligence community threat, it's more importantly outside the intelligence community.",
  "So, we cannot look at the shiny object, Russia, and totally forget about what China has done for decades.",
  "We do a great job, we spend a lot of money doing auditing and monitoring of our employees; that's great.",
  "We put a new memo out with some radical change of how we actually implement these for the practitioners.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, he was one of the four defector sources that we re-patriated back here to the U.S.",
  "And as continuous evaluation as you know how that works-- really has an impact of how we monitor folks.",
  "And I think we have to get there with more of a behavioral mindset of how we prevent insider threats.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThere's some key differences, and I think this is the whole-- glass houses aspects.",
  "And there's some usual characters in there, but there's also some new venues, which we'll talk about.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, the Insider Threat Taskforce is co-chaired by us and by Department of Justice.",
  "And we're going to look to have a rocket clearance, you know, get somebody cleared in a couple days.",
  "But they could ask those informants and those assets, \"Hey, what are you hearing in your (UNINTEL)?\"",
  "does on the counterintelligence side and then what the bureau does on the counterintelligence side?",
  "And I would sometimes-- I joke with my family or friends that it's the best of both worlds, right?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nNorth Koreans are very sophisticated with their cyber capabilities, that's it.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSecond question, Bill, is what is the role of your center vis-a-vis what C.I.A.",
  "And I think if you went through each set of couples individually, they'd be in different types.",
  "So, really opened our eyes in the government to say, \"Wow, there's valuable data other places.\"",
  "has arrested double-digit individuals in the last year or so all for spying on behalf of China.",
  "And immediately post-9/11, we kept on asking ourselves, well, what is else is possible, right?",
  "And then you could say-- \"I'm angry, I gave this information to WikiLeaks, but I'm not a spy.\"",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI'm also struck by the openness with which some of this stuff happens, right?",
  "We had folks at the U.N. that were being hobnobby with our secretary of U.N.'s support staff.",
  "to the best possible protection vectors for those individuals who are back here on safe soil.",
  "We're looking for that proverbial-- smoking gun, but we don't know when that's gonna happen.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\n--and Director Wray's doing a great job, and I wish him the best of luck.",
  "They both the intent and capability to do what they wanna do, but on a much smaller scale.",
  "And then as well as protect the people who buy your brand, you have an obligation to them.",
  "My argument is-- so, we have 4 million folks in the U.S. who were clearance holders, Mike.",
  "You're a big advocate for reforming the way people get clearances in the U.S. government.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nAnd then I would say Mexico is right below that, the country of Mexico.",
  "So, with respect to the prioritization and right now China is number one; it's not close.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nI would hope not, and the argument would be why would it be a big step?",
  "We're in in the same business, but at the end of the day, there's some key differences.",
  "Well, the damage is just as catastrophic because the Russian and Chinese get that data.",
  "And I will say that-- it's important for all Americans, Mike, to read that indictment.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, would you put anybody else on your worry list besides those four?",
  "And I think-- I think there was an eye awake-- eye-awakening process for our country.",
  "He was-- he stayed-- in the United Kingdom, and the three are here safely in the U.S.",
  "But I'll go back to the start of the conversation on the Russian illegals case, Mike.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, I'm not suggesting this, but one of the things we did in C.I.A.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, one of the cases you worked on was the Russian illegals case.",
  "They were spotting and assessing those individuals, going cocktail parties, dinner.",
  "You know, if you take the politics out of it, what they did was fascinating, right?",
  "\"You guys are-- you guys have that ability, help us think about the possibilities.\"",
  "But I think if it was an intelligence-based operation, it'll be hard to attribute.",
  "They want to be better than us economically, and they want to be the global power.",
  "So, you have some typewriters, some stuff from Ames and Hanssen now to beef it up.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nWell, not since that-- it's been-- not that-- long ago, but no.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe other thing that you talk about a lot is the insider threat.",
  "And I think we're really having a lot of success making that conversation known.",
  "We put a new--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhich is huge, right--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nHuge.",
  "We looked at mass transit, I'm not sure we're doing that right now effectively.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nTo me the number one priority we have is the insider threat.",
  "And I look at my role personally as the conduit for the F.B.I., C.I.A., N.S.A.",
  "But it's a great reminder for the folks who work on intelligence why we do it.",
  "And we can talk about--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--so, Snowden's not on the wall yet?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nIt's a win-win, I believe--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.",
  "So, in reality, the DNI is a co-chair and the attorney general is a co-chair.",
  "They are most likely going through that same auditing, monitoring right now.",
  "I believe we're in an economic war with them-- they have declared that war.",
  "And I think-- there's a combination of factors that go with that, but yes.",
  "arrest one of their employees for-- as an insider threat weeks ago, right?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd more aggressive today than they've ever been before.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, how much operational activity were they involved in?",
  "He--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOh, I would tell you he should --be on your wall.",
  "I think we're down about 10% already, so I think we're in the high 600s.",
  "So, to get to left of the event is where we're willing (UNINTEL) to be.",
  "And I get this asked this first question, so I'm gonna pitch it to you.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJust one final question because I just thought of it.",
  "So, I would say five years ago that thought would never cross my mind.",
  "Are there other objectives besides those that we need to think about?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, you run the National Insider Threat Taskforce.",
  "That'll prevent the bleeding afterwards, but we need to stop the cut.",
  "And as my boss Dan Coats said, it could just take one switch, right?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nInterestingly, I would put two areas on that list.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, this is the first question I wanted to ask you.",
  "And there's been some other locations we've had similar situations.",
  "Especially--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--because they could be coming here.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, what motivates these folks to do what they do?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nAnd I-- and it's funny, I get to do this, right.",
  "Majority of those are legitimate, but a lot of them aren't, right?",
  "From the human perspective, they're not on par with anybody else.",
  "It was set up after 2010 after Manning, the leaks with WikiLeaks.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, you've been very generous with your time.",
  "And then tangent to that, your security cannot be a lost leader.",
  "And something they've done at home for--\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYes.",
  "It's vicious, it's pervasive, and the efforts are catastrophic.",
  "And again--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n(UNINTEL) people operating there?",
  "So, that continues, and it's a persistent 1,000 grains of sand.",
  "So, it's more subtle, it's more a gradual spotting, assessing.",
  "Why don't you fly over there and (UNINTEL) take care of that?\"",
  "We're concerned just as much with China as we are with Russia.",
  "\"Hey, we have a business opportunity for you over in Beijing.",
  "So, Anna Chapman was not an illegal, she was a special agent.",
  "I think in a defense industrial base, it happens quite often.",
  "I think our listeners are in for a very important discussion.",
  "And we believe-- we're expanding it, we have some artifacts.",
  "), but noisier, louder, and they get caught more frequently.",
  "The Russians, very more tactical, very more-- interested (?",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd what does it take to get on that wall?",
  "It's a great model based off the joint terrorism taskforce.",
  "What else could they think of that we haven't thought of?",
  "And what the Russians do not have is unlimited resources.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd could you tell our folks about that?",
  "After a year of recruitment, that's how-- how they work.",
  "It's too successful for the Chinese to stop their theft.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd are there generational issues here?",
  "So, I think that a hard challenge to get that out there.",
  "And then the differences are just a couple more checks.",
  "just made an arrest two weeks ago for General Electric.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThat they're willing to do it again.",
  "We should have trusted, secret, and top secret, right?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nBut China is in the game, for sure.",
  "Well, the Chinese have doing that for decades, right?",
  "They have strategic plan to overtake us economically.",
  "were able to monitor these individuals for ten years.",
  "And we have what I think is a really unique memento.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nMore aggressive than ever, right.",
  "What can we do about it,\" what would you tell them?",
  "Do you see that taking root in the private sector?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nI do see it, and I see it often.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat's the traditional collector?",
  "They worked for the SVR and the illegals network.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nMr. Snowden is not on the wall.",
  "So, for us, legally, we have to have the ability.",
  "So, it would be right through the legal process.",
  "That's my concern; it's slippery slope we're on.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSo, we're still working on it.",
  "And you look at the the indictment of the F.B.I.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nMike, we are on the same page.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThe supply chain issue, right.",
  "We've had a number of executive student groups.",
  "So, again, General Electric just had the F.B.I.",
  "The Chinese need democracy for them to succeed.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nDirect correlation, correct.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, what about the Iranians?",
  "But two of them were special agent operators.",
  "But I look at this as think bigger, you know?",
  "What at the end of the day are they gonna do?",
  "So they're playing in the midterms right now?",
  "So, something happens when we're on the job.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--or used to work for them.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay, excellent, excellent.",
  "Do you think they would ever try that here?",
  "Can you tell our listeners about that case?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\n--that would happen, yep.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThat's a great question.",
  "The openness of this is interesting to me.",
  "Security must be part of your mission now.",
  "But we don't tell 'em how to do it, right?",
  "So, anybody else besides Cuba to the list?",
  "You know, he's metaphorically on our wall.",
  "I don't think we could've predicted that.",
  "This would be a big step for them, right?",
  "What is the risk we're trying to prevent?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nWe expect them to play.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nMore subtle than that.",
  "The case started in 1999, and the F.B.I.",
  "Two years ago, now, it's getting closer.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nI would concur, Mike.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBill, welcome to show.",
  "And-- so the taskforce sits in my shop.",
  "Bill, thank you so much for joining us.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYou're welcome, Mike.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nIt's not even close.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nChina is number one.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nPlenty of countries.",
  "And the Cubans would let them operate.",
  "And is any of that starting to change?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nBoth China answers.",
  "They chose the right guy for the job.",
  "So, that we're making progress there.",
  "So, we looked at this the last year.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nBad things, right?",
  "And I don't see expect we see that.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\n(UNINTEL) Africa.",
  "So, it sounds a bit eerily similar.",
  "Can you talk a bit more about that?",
  "So, they have unlimited resources.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThank you, Mike.",
  "So, who are the main players here?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThat's correct.",
  "(LAUGH)\n\nWILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nRight.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nGreat question.",
  "And we had seen the actual pitch.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nGreat question.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nGreat question.",
  "I just have three more questions.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThat's correct.",
  "Those are also insider threats.",
  "Or is it more subtle than that?",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nThanks, Mike.",
  "working with partners in C.I.A.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nQuite a bit.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.",
  "Can you talk about that a bit?",
  "3.5 million are in DOD, right?",
  "What about the North Koreans?",
  "And it was just the opposite.",
  "Bill, you are a career F.B.I.",
  "So, congratulations on that.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nWell, yes.",
  "It's been great to have you.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, yeah.",
  "We need to do more of that.",
  "Or is that a step too far?",
  "That's our big challenge.",
  "I think we can get there.",
  "* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* *",
  "So, why can't the C.I.A.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nIt is.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--ever.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAfrica.",
  "It is great to have you.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSure.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYeah.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nSure.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.",
  "It continues every day.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYeah.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nYes.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay.",
  "MICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah.",
  "That hasn't happened.",
  "WILLIAM EVANINA:\n\nNo.",
  "Thanks for having me.",
  "We looked at it hard.",
  "It was over 750,000.",
  "Pleasure to be here.",
  "And I would concur.",
  "The answer is no.",
  "What does it do?",
  "What is that?",
  "What is that?",
  "My pleasure.",
  "The F.B.I.",
  "Welcome.",
  "Or not?"
