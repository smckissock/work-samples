  "“This agreement was also in no way related to the group dinner Dr. Narasimhan had at the World Economic Forum in Davos with President Trump and 15 Europe based industry leaders.”\n\nJimenez also met the president after he took office at a Jan. 31, 2017 meeting in the White House.",
  "ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis (NOVN.S) confirmed it had a $1.2 million contract with the firm of Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, adding it soon realized it had made a mistake but had not been able to stop payments until the deal ended.",
  "Avenatti, who also alleged payments were made separately by AT&T (T.N) and Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (047810.KS), raised questions about the Novartis contract, saying it was unclear what healthcare expertise Cohen could provide to a global drug firm.",
  "The Swiss company said on Wednesday it had been approached in November last year by the U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office who wanted to know about the payments, while probing potential meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.",
  "It said Narasimhan, a Harvard-trained doctor who has vowed to burnish Novartis’s reputation as a maker of innovative drugs and leave years of allegations of wrongdoing behind, “had no involvement whatsoever” in the Cohen contract.",
  "The contract was approved in early 2017 under the former Novartis chief executive Joe Jimenez and was part of its efforts to learn more about how the new Trump administration might approach certain U.S. healthcare policy matters.",
  "An initial meeting under the agreement in March 2017 had in fact prompted Novartis to conclude Cohen, now the subject of a criminal investigation, would not be able to deliver the anticipated services, Novartis said.",

  "In U.S. television interviews with ABC and MSNBC, Avenatti declined to say where he had received the information about the payments to Cohen from.",
  "But the contract could only be terminated for cause, Novartis said, so payments continued to be made until the contract expired in February 2018.",
