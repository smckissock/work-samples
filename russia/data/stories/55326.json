  "The 63-year-old — who has become a wealthy corporate chieftain over the past nine years, but never stopped plotting a return from political exile — is one of two top contenders to succeed Merkel as chair of the center-right Christian Democratic Union in a vote of party insiders next month.",
  "While Kramp-Karrenbauer’s career has focused on local politics in the tiny state of Saarland, Merz has been a mainstay of corporate boardrooms and has become well acquainted with Washington power brokers through his leadership of the Atlantic Bridge, a German-American friendship group.",

  "During Merkel’s 13-year run, Germany has enacted a minimum wage, legalized same-sex marriage and, most alarmingly for many conservatives, become a coveted destination for asylum seekers fleeing war, oppression and poverty.",
  "His new career in business — he sits on the board of a number of companies and became chairman of the investment giant BlackRock — made him rich, allowing him to indulge a taste for cigars, fine wines and private planes.",
  "Tall and balding, Merz won sustained applause from the gray-haired crowd of nearly 800, who listened for three hours as the candidates made their pitches beneath the soaring roof of a converted 19th-century warehouse.",

  "“We’re a party of the center.”\n\nBut, without specifying how, Merz also promised to win back voters who have defected to the anti-immigration AfD.",

  "“I can feel in this hall what I’ve missed in recent years,” said Merz, allowing himself a smile during an otherwise stern-faced presentation.",
  "(Ulrich Hufnagel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nHe was a German leader straight out of central casting: whip-smart, serious, eloquent and erudite.",
  "Merkel — an east German woman with a flexible ideology — was always an anomaly in a party dominated by conservative west German men.",
