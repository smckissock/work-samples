  "The somber, annual Memorial Day ceremony will take place a day before the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of Israel’s foundation, according to the Hebrew calendar — and it took nearly that long to create the country’s first national pantheon.",
  "Instead, its minimalist design sidesteps internal conflicts over what should be memorialized, why and how, in a country still fighting its battles and split by deep ideological divisions.",
  "JERUSALEM — When Israel’s leaders gather on Wednesday at the country’s new National Memorial Hall for Israel’s Fallen, there will be little trace of the long battle it took to build it.",
  "The product of decades of political wrangling, emotional strife and procrastination, the monument reveals little about Israel’s wars with its external enemies.",
  "Adjacent to the national military cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, the Memorial Hall opened to the public without fanfare a few months ago.",
  "Lacking a consensus around a single national narrative, commemoration has been pared down to bare essentials."
