  "To the Editor:\n\nRe “Wary Lawmakers Question Facebook’s Founder” (front page, April 11) and “Data Mining Scandal Deals Blow to Clout of Billionaire Donors” (news article, April 11):\n\nWhile Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg deserve the grilling they are getting on the Hill, I find it amazing that Robert and Rebekah Mercer and their control of Cambridge Analytica are not getting the same treatment.",
  "If the Mercers are behind this incredible abuse of information gathering, done solely to sway an election, then why are they not being called on the carpet just as dramatically?",
  "It might not have been illegal, but bringing people like the Mercers before Congress to explain their motives would be very instructive to the voting public.",
  "However, it only took changing the minds of some 77,000 voters in three states to elect Donald Trump.",
  "Whether they pay attention to the ads that strategically bombard them each day is up to them.",
  "Facebook users know full well that letting it all hang out on social media is a risk.",
  "There are laws about how much money individuals can donate to candidates."
