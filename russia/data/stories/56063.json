  "Also on the list of people “associated with the case”: Akin Gump attorney Melissa Laurenza, who lost a legal battle last year to invoke attorney-client privilege to avoid testifying about her handling of Manafort’s FARA filings; consultant Sam Patten, who pleaded guilty last week to failing to register for Ukraine-related work he did to influence the incoming Trump administration last year; Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni; and a slew of vendors who sold Manafort home renovations, home theaters, pricey suits, luxury vehicles and other items he allegedly bought with untaxed proceeds from his Ukraine work.",
  "At a court hearing Wednesday, an attorney for Manafort indicated plans to try to put the law, lobbying and public affairs firms at the center of the upcoming trial by arguing that the former campaign chairman is the victim of an unfair double standard and was singled out because of his connection to Donald Trump’s presidential bid.",
  "Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, appears in the questionnaire along with three former European officials previously linked to Manafort’s Ukraine-related lobbying effort: former Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy, former Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer of Austria and former President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland.",
  "Cavusoglu has not been previously connected to the Manafort case, but he served as president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 2010 to 2012, a period just before Manafort began organizing outreach to former European officials in an effort to promote Yanukovych’s interests.",
  "Mr. Manafort is here because he was Trump’s campaign manager.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson seemed inclined not to allow Manafort’s lawyers to make a direct selective-prosecution argument to the jury at the trial, which is set to begin later this month.",
  "The roster, released on Wednesday as part of a questionnaire distributed to potential jurors in the case, includes witnesses likely to testify at Manafort’s trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent, money laundering and obstruction of justice.",

  "The questionnaire includes 17 people from the Podesta Group, 13 connected to Fact Based Communications, nine affiliated with Mercury, seven with law firm Skadden Arps, two with FTI Consulting and one from Edelman.",
  "A separate trial on other tax- and bank-fraud charges, also brought by Mueller’s office, ended last month with a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicting Manafort on eight counts and deadlocking on 10 others.",
  "“These are all folks that were treated very differently by the [Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act] office and the Office of Special Counsel than Mr. Manafort,” attorney Kevin Downing said.",
  "The questionnaire calls the roster a “partial list” of people connected to the case and asks potential jurors whether they “have any personal, family or business connection of any sort” with those listed.",
