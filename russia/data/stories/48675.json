  "In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app, the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use, not commercial purposes.",

  "Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy.",
  "This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps.",

  "Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether.",
  "“It doesn’t go away after you’ve stopped looking at the ad,” he said.",
