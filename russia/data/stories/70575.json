  "The deputy head of Russia's Union of the Tourism Industry, Yuri Barzykin, told Tass on Wednesday that Russian holidaymakers \"should not dismiss the idea to relax at home\" and should opt to holiday in Russia if they are finding alternatives to Egypt abroad too expensive.",
  "Over the weekend Putin ordered all flights to Egypt to be temporarily but indefinitely ceased, following advice from the Russian security service on Friday to do so until more is known about why Russia's Metrojet A321 liner crashed in Egypt two weeks ago.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin's head of administration told Russians not to expect Moscow's suspension of flights to Egypt to be lifted any time soon, saying the decision \"is long term,\" state news agency Itar-Tass reported on Wednesday.",
  "Moscow has introduced emergency procedures in flying tourists home such as sending Russian officials inspecting the airports from which the majority of Russians are flying and transporting luggage in separate cargo planes.",
  "Speaking to press on Wednesday, Kremlin administration head Sergei Ivanov explained that \"to fundamentally change the system of safety, security and monitoring is impossible to do in only a week and even in a month.\"",
  "Ivanov spoke a day after Russian national daily Kommersant cited a source inside the Russian government saying that Moscow believed the suspension could last \"several years.\"",
  "The Russian government later told Tass that at present they \"cannot give any time frame\" for the ban as the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.",
  "Russia estimates that there are currently 34,000 Russian tourists still in Egypt, all of whom are scheduled to be back in Russia by November 20.",
  "Ivanov said he could not say how long the flights would be suspended but said he thought \"it will be a few months at the least.\"",
  "The ban has hit Russia's tourism companies in particular as Egypt is the number one destination for Russians on holiday.",
  "The crash is Russia's biggest airline tragedy: All 224 people on board were killed, the majority of whom were Russian."
