  "What is further regrettable is that this is not the first time Zuckerberg has been asked to provide more transparency and accountability for Facebook's business practices and this may in fact have played a role in why Zuckerberg proceeded to ignore what even some of his own high-level employees suggested were illegal practices at the time they were being carried out.",
