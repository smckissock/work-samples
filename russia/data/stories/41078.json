  "Russia is killing ISIS and Iran is killing ISIS.”\n\nThe trouble, of course, was that while Assad may indeed have been killing ISIS, he was also killing Syrian civilians—and so prolifically that most Western governments, including the United States, long ago severed diplomatic relations with Assad’s government and called on Assad to step down.",
  "And though President Barack Obama had previously publicly drawn a “red line” over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and threatened to respond militarily if it were crossed, he decided, at the last moment, to refrain from any military action, securing instead a promise from Assad to turn over the country’s chemical weapons.",
  "During a press briefing on Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, strongly suggested that the Administration is preparing a military response in order to punish the Syrian government and deter it from carrying out any more chemical-weapons attacks.",
  "In a statement, Trump blamed Assad’s regime, called the attack “reprehensible,” and said that it “cannot be ignored by the civilized world.” He also described the attack as a “consequence of the past Administration’s weakness and irresolution.”\n\nWhat happens now?",
  "Most notoriously, in 2013, the Assad regime was accused by Western governments of using poison gas in the Damascus suburb of East Ghouta, an attack that killed at least fourteen hundred people and wounded more than three thousand, most of them civilians.",
  "Last November, a few days before the U.S. Presidential election, I was among a group of American reporters and researchers who visited Damascus, Syria, to interview President Bashar al-Assad and his foreign minister, Walid Muallem.",
  "And, indeed, the Washington Post reported on Monday that, earlier this year, the Blackwater founder Erik Prince met secretly in the Seychelles with a confidant of Putin to discuss, among other things, a possible deal on Syria.",
  "Both Muallem and his boss very much wanted Trump to win, hoping that, if he did, some of the pressure on their regime, which has been ostracized around the globe for committing war crimes, would ease up.",
  "But Obama’s other aim, in addition to destroying ISIS, was to avoid a collapse of the Syrian state—the kind that might happen if the United States were to directly attack the Assad regime.",
  "As Trump and his advisers go through the options for a potential military strike, they will no doubt be thinking the same thing: If Assad falls, what comes after?",
  "During the campaign, while Clinton was promising to get tough on Assad, Trump had praised him, if for no other reason than that he was battling the Islamic State.",
  "Assad and Muallem had every reason to think that Trump would give them a more sympathetic hearing than they’d receive from a Clinton Administration.",
  "Sources inside Syria are reporting that a sarin-gas attack in Idlib Province killed dozens of civilians and injured hundreds more on Tuesday.",
  "Trump had also made numerous positive references to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leader and Assad’s most important international ally.",
  "Obama feared that the ensuing vacuum in Damascus would be filled by the likes of ISIS and the Al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra.",
  "The Obama Administration took plenty of actions against the Assad government, including sending arms to rebel groups.",
  "It was one of the most significant moments of Obama’s Presidency, and one that Trump and other Republicans ridiculed.",
  "There was talk, after Trump’s election, of a possible rapprochement with Syria, perhaps facilitated by Putin.",
  "At a meeting with the group, Muallem was asked which candidate he favored, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.",
  "“I don’t like Assad at all,’’ Trump said in a Presidential debate in October.",
  "Trump’s comment put forward no clear policy or planned response.",
  "When Obama looked at Damascus in 2013, he saw Baghdad in 2003.",
  "Now comes the moment of truth for President Trump.",
  "“I hope they will not elect anybody,” he said.",
  "Muallem laughed at his own joke.",
  "Those were legitimate concerns.",
  "“But Assad is killing ISIS.",
  "He wasn’t serious."
