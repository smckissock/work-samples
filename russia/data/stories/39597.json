  "Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein hired private security companies to gather information on women accusing him of sexual misconduct and journalists investigating their reports, according to a new report published Monday by The New Yorker.",
  "According to one contract cited in the report, one investigation was explicitly undertaken to suppress the allegations that eventually emerged last month in The New Yorker and the New York Times that resulted in Weinstein's downfall.",
  "Citing multiple documents and sources, The New Yorker said Weinstein hired the firms to send agents using false identities to get close to people, such as actress Rose McGowan, to find out what damaging information they had.",
  "Those companies reportedly included Kroll, a global corporate intelligence firm, and Black Cube, a business intelligence company made up largely of former Israeli intelligence officers.",
  "Through those investigations, Weinstein was able to keep tabs on who might speak out against him, the report said, and allegedly made efforts to pressure them into silence.",
  "Weinstein's spokesperson called the report \"fiction.\"",
