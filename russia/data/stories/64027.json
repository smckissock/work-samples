  "Rubio said that he “respects and accepts” that Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee but added \"that’s not going to change the reservations I have about his campaign, or about some of the policies he’s established.”\n\nHis comments — amounting to little more than a lukewarm acceptance of Trump’s likely nomination — came the day after he issued a statement declaring he has “never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered” for Trump’s vice-president.",
  "While he said he didn’t “necessarily disagree that sometimes our effort is disproportionate” to what the U.S. receives in return, “we also have to understand we have benefitted from this agreement.”\n\nRubio made no mention of Trump by name, but seemed to be speaking implicitly of the presumptive GOP nominee, who has called for rethinking NATO and demanding other countries pay the U.S. for its military and humanitarian aid.",
  "Rubio said it’s important to make the case that “if we are not engaged, the price we pay in the long run is much higher than the price we pay for engagement.”\n\nRubio hinted that his role this election cycle would be promoting those views by “supporting candidates around the country, especially for federal office, that share those views.”",

  "“I’m not insisting he change anything — he needs to be true to whoever he is, and if that’s the things he believes in, then he’ll have the chance to make that argument to the American people,” he said.",
  "Still, Rubio promised to be an outspoken advocate for his own views on foreign policy, many of which run counter to the more isolationist doctrine Trump has established over the course of his campaign.",
