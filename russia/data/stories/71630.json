  "“We are quite aware that we have allowed some misunderstanding of our mutual relationships,” Macron said, adding that both sides should move forward together and “keep working on strengthening our mutual trust.”\n\nDespite their differences, they do have another important thing in common: A willingness to stand up to—or, depending on your perspective, stick it to—the United States.",
  "“This is the core of diplomacy,” he said, adding: “It’s not because you’re not friends on one issue that you cannot be friends on another.”\n\nIn a joint press conference following their meeting Thursday, Macron put the emphasis on France and Russia’s mutual interests, as well as their historic and cultural ties.",
