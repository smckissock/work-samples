  "He accurately characterized the conflict in eastern Ukraine as a Russian invasion, and he supports providing defensive weapons to Ukraine.”\n\nBut Rubio also found Tillerson’s answers to other questions “troubling.” Tillerson, for example, did not condemn Russia’s violations of the Minsk II agreement, Rubio said, and he refused to say that Russian President Vladimir Putin had committed war crimes.",
  "“After long and careful consideration, I believe Mr. Tillerson’s demonstrated business orientation and his responses to questions during the confirmation hearing could compromise his ability as Secretary of State to forcefully promote the values and ideals that have defined our country and our leading role in the world for more than 200 years.",
  "In his evaluation of Tillerson, Rubio said he focused on whether Tillerson would, as secretary of state, “make the defense of liberty, democracy and human rights a priority.” Rubio said he was “encouraged” by a number of answers Tillerson provided throughout the confirmation process.",

  "Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, announced Monday that he would vote against him.",
  "I will therefore not be supporting his nomination with my vote in Committee or on the Senate floor,” he said in a statement.",
  "I believe the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet.",
