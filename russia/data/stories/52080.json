  "SPICER: It is interesting, for what it's worth, just -- there's a story that came out in Buzzfeed that notes that the DNC is on the record saying that the FBI has never actually contacted them to validate claims by CrowdStrike, which is the third-party tech security firm, and never actually requested the hacked servers.",

  "And he's going to continue to fight for that and make sure that companies don't get a tax benefit, frankly, to go off overseas that denies -- that hurts American workers, and then be able to sell back and profit.",
  "I will tell you that the way that Mr. Trump looks at this is that if American companies stay in the United States and continue to hire American workers to grow our manufacturing base, then there is no tariff.",
