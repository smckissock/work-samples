  "This week alone, the New York Times reported that Kushner’s family business got big loans from two US financial institutions shortly after he met with their executives in the White House, and the Washington Post reported that foreign officials have discussed using his business entanglements to manipulate him, and NBC News reported Mueller is asking whether the Kushner business influenced Trump’s foreign policy.",
  "Though company spokespeople insist things are rosy, one “person familiar with the company’s finances” told the Bloomberg duo that the tower was “the Jenga puzzle piece that could set the [Kushner] empire teetering.”\n\nThe Kushners came up with an ambitious and enormously expensive redevelopment plan to turn things around by knocking down the tower and building a more modern one in its place.",
  "4) Jared is mentioned in Michael Flynn’s plea agreement: At another point in the transition, Kushner instructed Flynn to call several foreign government officials, including Ambassador Kislyak, to ask them to try to block a pending United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel’s settlement policies.",
  "... And he’s frozen on 666 [Fifth Avenue], when it goes under next year, the whole thing’s cross-collateralized ... he’s wiped, he’s gone, he’s done, it’s over ... Toast.”\n\nBut Kushner Companies sent a statement to the Real Deal in January that reads: “The Office of Special Counsel has not contacted us.",
  "Additionally, and probably not coincidentally, more and more questions have been raised about Kushner’s efforts in recent years to drum up investments in his family’s real estate projects — and whether those efforts inappropriately overlapped with his work in the Trump transition or White House.",
  "So, per the Bloomberg report, since 2015, they’ve approached a Saudi billionaire, a Qatari business executive, the richest man in France, a South Korean government-controlled sovereign wealth fund, and the Chinese insurance company Anbang — all without success, despite Jared’s best efforts.",
  "5) Jared filed laughably incomplete disclosure forms of his foreign contacts: Since the election, Kushner has come under scrutiny for initially leaving these contacts he’d had with Russians, and contacts he’d had with other foreigners during the campaign, off his security clearance form.",
  "Everything has been handled in a normal, professional and commercial manner.”\n\nThe FBI hasn’t given Jared a top-secret clearance, and we don’t know why\n\nAs if all this weren’t enough, in recent weeks, the long-simmering problem of Jared’s security clearance has finally boiled over.",
  "Well, in a 2009 interview with Gabe Sherman of New York magazine, Jared stood squarely behind his father — defending Charles’s vicious actions in a revealing comment that prized family loyalty and business success above such petty matters as ethics and following the law.",
  "Kushner has risen to the White House — and brought conflicts of interest with him\n\nWhen Trump decided to name Kushner to a top White House job last year, Jared followed his father-in-law’s lead by doing the bare minimum to disentangle himself from his business interests.",
  "3) Jared met with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker during the transition: On December 1, 2016, Kushner and National Security Adviser-designate Michael Flynn met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at Trump Tower — a meeting they didn’t disclose for months.",
  "Back in 2006, Kushner Companies agreed to pay $1.8 billion for the building, setting a new record for the highest price for a single real estate asset ever paid in the United States, and financing it almost entirely through debt near the peak of the housing bubble.",
  "Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators are reportedly interested in the senior White House adviser for a plethora of reasons — including, but not limited to, the central topic of whether the Trump team worked with Russia to interfere with the 2016 campaign.",
  "There’s also:\n\nKushner is also under scrutiny in the Russia probe\n\nThe family business dealings aren’t the end of Jared’s woes: In special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election, Kushner’s name just keeps coming up.",
  "Believing his relatives were behind all this, Charles did a truly remarkable thing in response: He arranged to pay a prostitute to seduce his sister Esther’s husband, had the ensuing sexual encounter taped and photographed, and sent the tape and photos to Esther.",
  "And a recent Washington Post report revealed that Kushner had caused consternation by contacting foreign officials and not informing the National Security Council — and that foreign officials had discussed trying to gain influence over him through his business.",
  "1) Jared attended the June Trump Tower meeting: Along with his brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort, Kushner attended an infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer and four other individuals with Russian ties on June 9, 2016.",
  "An excellent report from Bloomberg’s David Kocieniewski and Caleb Melby dives deep into what’s happened since: The Kushners had to sell off pieces of the building and have continued to lose money on the 50.5 percent of its office space they still own.",
  "(New appointees often do their work with an interim clearance for a time while the FBI checks into their background — but this generally doesn’t take 13 months, especially if an appointee holds a role as high-level and important as Kushner’s.)",
  "2) Jared oversaw the Trump campaign’s digital operation: Mueller’s team is reportedly looking into whether anyone on Trump’s digital team collaborated with Russian cyber operatives and bots who targeted voters in key areas with propaganda.",
  "Last week, CNN reported that the special counsel’s investigators were looking into Kushner’s “efforts to secure financing for his company from foreign investors during the presidential transition” — including from non-Russian investors.",
  "And after that, on December 13, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, head of Vnesheconombank (a Russian bank currently under US sanctions that has been involved in Kremlin espionage and promoting the Russian government’s interests abroad).",
  "Jared, meanwhile, became the public face of Kushner Companies, spent a reported $10 million to buy a majority stake in the New York Observer newspaper, and began dating fellow real estate scion Ivanka Trump (whom he’d marry in 2009).",
  "It all blew up in Charles’s face — the feds learned of everything, Charles was arrested, and after pleading guilty to tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering (for the tape), he was sent to jail in 2005.",
  "The Porter scandal led to increased scrutiny of the Trump White House’s handling of the clearance process (which, it seemed, top aides had previously looked the other way about in part because Jared was one person affected).",
  "It could involve his business — the New Yorker’s Adam Entous and Evan Osnos reported that US intelligence officials got information that Kushner had discussed his business interests with the Chinese ambassador in early 2017.",
  "6) Jared seemed to want Trump to fire James Comey: Top advisers in Trump’s early White House such as Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon reportedly urged the president not to take such a rash move as firing the FBI director.",
  "All participants in the meeting, including Kushner, claim that nothing of significance ended up happening in it — that not only did no dirt change hands but there wasn’t even any useful dirt on offer in the first place.",
  "At the meeting, Kushner and Kislyak “discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin,” the Washington Post reported months later.",
  "Need excuse to get out of meeting.”\n\nBut Mueller’s investigators have been digging into events surrounding the meeting, and if there is more to the story of what happened that day, Kushner may well know it.",
  "That changed when news broke last month that White House staff secretary Rob Porter had a history of spousal abuse allegations against him — and that he was also doing his job with an interim clearance.",
  "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s probe, personally informed the White House last month that “significant information” meant Kushner’s clearance couldn’t yet be approved.",
  "Since then, there have been a seemingly endless array of reports about conflicts and questionable activity from either Jared or Kushner Companies, which is privately held and has opaque finances.",
  "Around the same time, a Kushner Companies bookkeeper filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging illegal political contributions by Charles and other improper financial practices from the company.",
  "The Kushners have spent much of the past few years trying to get wealthy foreigners to finance an expensive redevelopment plan for the property — but so far, all those efforts have failed.",
  "Neither party can agree on what the meeting was about — Kushner says he took the meeting for diplomatic reasons and they discussed world affairs, but not his family’s business interests.",
  "But he did it all with a mere “interim” security clearance — because, for reasons that aren’t yet public, the FBI has been reluctant to approve him for a full “top secret” clearance.",
  "The original Kushner family scandal was lurid and ugly\n\nBorn in 1981, Jared Kushner grew up in New Jersey amid a family environment of wealth, privilege — and, eventually, scandal.",
  "The deal fell through — and, when a crisis erupted in the Gulf a few months later, Trump conspicuously and oddly contradicted his own Secretary of State to harshly condemn Qatar.",
  "Whatever’s going on, Chief of Staff John Kelly has imposed new rules that White House staffers still waiting for a full clearance could no longer handle top-secret information.",
  "The Post story on his foreign contacts and the Times story on the loans he got from companies after meeting with their executive in the White House both leaked in recent days.",
  "The Intercept reported that, in April 2017 (while Jared was in the White House), his father and Kushner Companies made a direct pitch for funds to Qatar’s minister of finance.",
  "The problem is evident: Kushner Companies needs a huge pile of money and is looking for it from foreign sources as Jared holds a foreign policy portfolio in the White House.",
  "The rabbis with the diamonds and all the shit coming out of Israel ... and all these guys coming out of Eastern Europe ... all these Russian guys ... and guys in Kazakhstan.",
  "However, Mueller’s indictment of several Russians in February did not allege that anyone in the Trump camp was knowingly involved in the Russian propaganda activity.",
  "(Jared dined with Anbang’s chair in New York eight days after the election as discussions were ongoing, while he was playing a major role in the Trump transition.)",
  "Meanwhile, and separately from Mueller’s probe, federal prosecutors and state regulators have both recently sought documents on Kushner Companies’ finances.",
  "Well, I’m doing the same.’ ”\n\nThough the scandal was embarrassing and the subject of enormous media attention, it didn’t keep either Kushner down for long.",
  "(This could conceivably be used by Mueller as leverage to try to “flip” Jared, should he know any incriminating Russian interference-related information.)",
  "Looming over so much of this is the fact that the Kushner company owes $600 million on a money-losing Manhattan tower that’s fully due in just one year.",
  "(Also, Kushner later happened to be aboard Air Force One when now-President Trump got Don Jr. to release a very misleading statement about the meeting.)",
  "For his part, Steve Bannon speculated at length to journalist Michael Wolff that Mueller could target Kushner Companies for potential money laundering.",
  "Kushner Companies needs a huge pile of money and is looking for it from foreign sources as Jared holds a foreign policy portfolio in the White House.",
  "And for now, Jared continues to hold his high-level White House job, in which he is tasked with, among other things, making peace in the Middle East.",

  "With almost too many controversies and perils to count, here, then, is a guide to the many woes of the senior White House son-in-law.",
  "For unclear reasons, the FBI has refused to grant him full “top secret” status — throwing his position in the White House into doubt.",
  "This has raised questions about whether Kushner was seeking to shield his contacts with the Russian government from US intelligence.",
  "This naturally raises questions of why he did so, and whether he feared he himself might have something to hide in the Russia probe.",
  "Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner... It’s as plain as a hair on your face...",
  "7) There could be leverage on Jared that’s unrelated to Russia: Finally, Mueller’s interest in Kushner may even go beyond Russia.",
  "Kushner says he arrived late and left early — and that he in fact emailed his assistant during it: “Can u pls call me on my cell?",
  "Charles also became the top donor to Jim McGreevey, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey who won the office in 2001.",
  "He stepped down from his official role at Kushner Companies, but he kept most of his interest in it and his real estate holdings.",
  "(For his part, Jared has said the meeting was uneventful and that the line of communication was intended to be about Syria.)",
  "They’re going to go right through that.” ...”Charlie Kushner,” said Bannon, smacking his head again in additional disbelief.",
  "But a family feud erupted over business and money, splitting Charles Kushner from his brother Murray and his sister Esther.",
  "(Though it should be noted that Bannon is hardly an unbiased source here — he despises Kushner and views him as an enemy.)",
  "At the very least, he was supportive of Comey’s firing, and by many accounts, he outright advocated for Trump to do it.",
  "(He arranged for a second prostitute to try to seduce the whistleblowing bookkeeper too, but the guy turned her down.)",
  "(After the meeting, Gorkov headed off to Japan, where he reportedly planned to meet with the visiting Vladimir Putin.)",
  "Now, a $1.2 billion mortgage — half of which the Kushners are responsible for — is coming fully due in February 2019.",
  "And he trained Jared in the family business early, helping advise the college student on buying his own real estate.",
  "Kushner has been in the White House since Trump’s first day and been privy to all sorts of top-secret information.",
  "“His siblings stole every piece of paper from his office, and they took it to the government,” Jared maintained.",
