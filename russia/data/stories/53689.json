  "The next night, June 7, after the meeting was set, Trump gave a speech celebrating primary wins in which he promised another speech the following week where he would “be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.” The dirt offered by the Russians in the June 9 meeting wasn’t considered useful by Trump Jr. and others present; the Trump speech about the Clintons was postponed.",
  "The chairman, David Pecker, is an old friend of Trump and, according to the government document (which Cohen didn’t contest) “offered to help deal with negative stories about [Trump’s] relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.” That was in August 2015.",

  "A few days later, on July 12, Trump denied having known about the meeting “until a couple of days ago.”\n\nWhen news reports emerged last month — on July 26, 2018 — that Cohen was prepared to tell investigators that Trump knew about the meeting in advance, Trump again denied that this was the case.",
  "His response was terse: “No.”\n\nAs more details emerged, including about the repayment of the money to Cohen, Trump’s attorney, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, indicated that he didn’t know when Trump knew about the payment, but that it was after the agreement was reached.",
  "We know, from documents filed by the government in relation to the hearing Tuesday in which Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, that the chairman of AMI had allegedly reached out to the Trump campaign only two months after Trump announced his candidacy.",
  "“Later on.”\n\nHe goes on to say that the payments to the women — $150,000 paid to former Playboy model Karen McDougal by the publisher of the National Enquirer and $130,000 paid by Cohen himself to adult film actress Stormy Daniels — didn’t come from campaign money.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2018\n\nUpdate: In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis made the most direct assertion to date that Trump might have known about the Trump Tower meeting in advance.",
  "If he knew about it in advance, legal experts who have spoken with The Post suggest that Trump could be considered to have been involved in a conspiracy to violate legal prohibitions against soliciting something of value from a foreign actor.",
  "The Trump Tower meeting\n\nThe first mention of a possible meeting between Trump campaign officials and a lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton provided by the Russian government came in an email to Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016.",

  "pic.twitter.com/K4npwEQaUI — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) August 22, 2018\n\nThe Daniels payment\n\nAs with the Trump Tower meeting, our understanding of how the agreement between Daniels and Cohen came about has evolved over time.",
  "Trump’s knowledge of the deals.”\n\nDuring the briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether Trump was lying in April when he denied knowing about the Daniels payment.",
  "When he knew, of course, is central to evaluating whether Cohen’s presentation of what happened is accurate and, by extension, the extent to which Trump might be implicated in having violated federal law.",
  "But Cohen, according to the government document, reached an agreement with the Trump Organization to be repaid for fronting the $130,000 payment Daniels received under the cover of false invoices.",

  "Over the next few days, Trump Jr. and his contact with a Russian musician and developer named Emin Agalarov worked to establish where and when the meeting would take place.",

  "If Trump was lying, though, and if, as Cohen attests, he knew about the payments before their occurring, he could have violated the law.",
  "There’s another situation where the same question needs to be answered: When did Trump know about the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016?",
  "It’s why knowing what Trump knew and when is so important — and why the president could have an incentive to lie about those details.",
  "“The president in this matter has done nothing wrong, and there are no charges against him.”\n\nThat’s a different issue, of course.",
  "\"at this juncture I can only say that he was present during a discussion with junior and dad\" about the Trump Tower meeting.",
