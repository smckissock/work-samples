  "Papadopoulos, a young energy consultant whose work for the Trump campaign has landed him squarely in the crosshairs of the FBI's investigation into Russia's election interference, has been on house arrest since last July at the home he owns with his mother and younger brother in Chicago.",
  "Before it was scrubbed, Mifsud's London Centre biography said he had \"lectured extensively throughout the world,\" \"worked in a number of universities,\" \"attended and chaired conferences\" and \"organized major ministerial and institutional meetings on pan-Mediterranean dialogue.\"",
  "\"The interview lasted about two hours, and they asked a lot of questions about Joseph Mifsud,\" Mangiante said, referring to the London-based professor who told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\"",
  "'I knew something was wrong from the first day I arrived'\n\nThe FBI's interest in Mangiante makes sense given the three months she spent working for Mifsud — from September through November of 2016 — at the London Centre of International Law Practice.",
  "She told ABC last month that Papadopoulos had communicated with Steve Bannon, who chaired the campaign before becoming the White House chief strategist, and Michael Flynn, a top campaign surrogate who Trump later appointed national security adviser.",
  "Screenshot/Twitter Mifsud came under renewed scrutiny last weekend, when The New York Times reported that Papadopoulos drunkenly told an Australian diplomat in May 2016— one month after meeting with Mifsud — that Russia had dirt on Clinton.",
  "He attempted for months to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, helped craft Trump's first major foreign policy speech, and gave an interview as a Trump campaign official to Russia's Interfax News Agency six weeks before Election Day.",
  "The diplomat relayed the details of his conversation with Papadopoulos to Australian government officials, who in turn relayed it to the US government shortly after news surfaced that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked.",
  "But court documents filed by Mueller's team and made public in late October show that Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal agents about the timing and nature of his conversations with Mifsud.",
  "The Trump campaign was quick to downplay Papadopoulos' role on the campaign following his guilty plea, describing him as a \"coffee boy\" who played no meaningful foreign policy role — a claim at which Mangiante bristles.",
  "Mueller is investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and had charged Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia-linked foreign nationals during the election.",
  "Mifsud has been filmed speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club, a think tank based in the Russian city of Veliky Novgorod that is close to President Vladimir Putin and hosts him every year for a keynote address.",
  "By that point, she had already begun chatting with Papadopoulos, who had messaged her on LinkedIn two months earlier after seeing that they shared a mutual professional connection — Mifsud.",
  "'It's very naïve to dismiss someone like that when you have evidence'\n\nSimona Mangiante ABC\n\nMangiante emphasized that she could not discuss the details of Papadopoulos' case.",
  "Asked why she thought Papadopoulos told the Australian diplomat about Russia's Clinton dirt, or what he may have meant by it, Mangiante said she couldn't say with certainty.",
  "Alex Wong/Getty Mangiante flew to Chicago to see Papadopoulos and was promptly served with a subpoena by a federal agent working for special counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "They traveled to Europe that summer for a whirlwind vacation and parted ways in late July, with Mangiante staying in Italy and Papadopoulos heading back to the US.",
  "By the time he emerged from his Alexandria jail cell on July 28, Papadopoulos had become a cooperating witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.",
  "But he did not tell the agents initially about Mifsud's claims that he had high-level Russian government connections and had learned of Kremlin dirt on Clinton.",
  "He also represented the campaign at a Republican National Convention event and met with Israeli leaders as a foreign policy adviser during Trump's inauguration.",
  "The special counsel's statement of offense outlined Papadopoulos' contact with a London-based \"professor\" who was later identified as Mifsud in news reports.",
  "The organization listed Mifsud as its director as recently as October, but his biography was deleted from the website following Papadopoulos' indictment.",
  "In November, Mifsud disappeared from Link Campus University (LCU) in Rome, the private university where he has worked on-and-off since the early 2000s.",
  "He even helped to organize a meeting between Trump and [Egyptian President Abdel Fattah] el-Sisi through a connection he had at the Egyptian embassy.\"",
  "Mangiante and Papadopoulos first met in person in New York in April 2017, she said, about seven months after they first started chatting on LinkedIn.",
  "\"I've seen the emails,\" Mangiante said, referring to Papadopoulos' communications during the election with high-level members of the Trump campaign.",
  "Mifsud managed the university's international partnerships, according to BuzzFeed, including one with Lomonosov Moscow State University.",
  "Papadopoulos texted Mangiante when he landed at Dulles airport in Washington, DC on July 27 — minutes before he was arrested by the FBI.",
  "A mysterious résumé\n\nPapadopoulos proposed a Trump-Putin meeting during a March 2016 meeting with campaign foreign policy advisers.",
  "Papadopoulos' inadvertent disclosure, combined with the massive data breach, is what triggered the FBI's Trump-Russia probe.",
  "He told the FBI in his January interview that Mifsud was \"a nothing\" and \"just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something.\"",
  "When her contract was up in September 2016 with the European Parliament in Brussels, Mangiante wanted to move to London.",
  "Scouring LinkedIn, she noticed that Mifsud's organization was looking to hire people with experience working for the EU.",
  "The school also removed the biography for Nagi Idris, the director of the London Centre of International Law Practice.",
  "Mueller confirmed that the FBI uses drones for domestic surveillance during a hearing on FBI oversight in 2013.",
  "\"We'll have an engagement party in the US this month, and we were hoping to get married this summer in Italy.\"",
  "\"It's very naive to dismiss somebody like that, as a 'coffee boy,' when you have evidence,\" Mangiante said.",
  "\"George is very calm,\" the 29-year-old Italian lawyer said in an interview with Business Insider this week.",
  "Papadopoulos proposed at the end of September, about a year after he sent her that first LinkedIn message.",
  "Courtesy Simona Mangiante\n\nSimona Mangiante says her fiancé, George Papadopoulos, is staying positive.",
  "Papadopoulos's cousin wrote to her on Facebook in the interim, explaining that he had been arrested.",
  "Mangiante reiterated that she and Papadopoulos had nothing to hide and were looking to the future.",
  "Mangiante said she first met Mifsud when she started her job at the European Parliament in 2009.",
  "He struck her as a lobbyist who worked \"to connect people from different governments,\" she said.",
  "\"It was shocking to me that they wanted me as a witness, but I have nothing to hide,\" she added.",
  "\"When he came to deliver my subpoena, my first reaction was to contact the Italian embassy.\"",
  "\"He had finished his work for the campaign and I had left my job at the European Parliament.",
  "The embassy told her that they could find an American lawyer to represent her in Chicago.",
  "Mangiante said she did not hear from him again until five days later, on August 1.",
  "I had worked in real diplomatic environments and this didn't feel that way at all.",
  "Mifsud also wrote three pro-Russia articles that are featured on Valdai's website.",
  "Mangiante said she was introduced to Idris on her first day of work at the Centre.",
  "\"I knew something was wrong from the first day I arrived there,\" Mangiante said.",
  "Papadopoulos represented the campaign at numerous points during the election.",
  "But the rate would be about $800 per hour — money she said she didn't have.",
  "\"We've created such a strong bond in such a short time,\" Mangiante said.",
  "Mangiante said Papadopoulos asked her at the time, referring to Mifsud.",
  "\"We had traveled to Mykonos, to Athens, and to Capri,\" Mangiante said.",
  "\"Not even George really knew anything about him,\" Mangiante said.",
  "\"It was traumatic, and completely unexpected,\" Mangiante said.",
  "He also worked for the government of Malta, where he is from.",
  "LCU has since removed Mifsud's biography from their website.",
  "Right now, for example, they're busy planning their wedding.",
  "I never even had clarity about who [Mifsud] actually was.\"",
  "\"So I went to the US, and everything changed completely.\"",
  "\"I didn't know what was going on,\" Mangiante said.",
  "\"They're just undermining all of George's efforts.",
  "Mangiante left the organization in November 2016.",
  "\"And I think they were happy with the interview.\"",
  "\"There are moments, of course, when we get down.",
  "They just have to wait for his sentencing first.",
  "So she went into the interview without one.",
  "\"It was something, just, unreal,\" she said.",
  "Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to the charge.",
  "\"But they clearly had had many drinks.\"",
  "There are a lot of restrictions.\"",
  "We spent every second together.\"",
  "Beyond that, not much is known.",
  "\"It all felt very artificial.",
  "\"I was not there,\" she said.",
  "\"How do you know him?\"",
  "\"What does he do?\""
