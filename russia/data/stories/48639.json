  "Frustration is brewing at top levels inside Facebook over what has become a pattern during the controversies that have bedeviled the company recently: The public silence of co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "No matter who's speaking out, it's difficult to distill the conversation to soundbites, blog posts or after-the-fact Facebook Lives starring Zuckerberg that take place once a problem has become a crisis.",
  "\"Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue,\" the statement said.",
  "\"The thing that sets Facebook apart [from other tech companies,]\" said a source at the company, is that \"Mark and Sheryl [Sandberg] are brands themselves ... they're pretty widely recognized.",
  "But the public rarely gets insight into the behind-the-scenes conversations at Facebook, even when the decisions made during them could impact a significant portion of the population.",

  "We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\"",
  "But in what's turned out to be one of the hardest years in the company's history, Zuckerberg has remained notably out of the public fray.",
  "According to insiders, Zuckerberg is well respected within the company, and genuinely passionate about making the world a better place.",
  "That's why there's a desire internally to have a public discussion around the challenges that come along with solving those problems.",
  "But the difference is the level of name recognition that Zuckerberg and his COO, Sheryl Sandberg, have in the outside world.",
  "There are of course other people at Facebook who can speak publicly, and at other tech companies that's often what happens.",
  "If there's a problem at Microsoft, another Facebook source noted, people aren't calling for CEO Satya Nadella to speak out.",
  "\"The consensus is that we should be more open more quickly and that Mark needs to be the face on very difficult topics.\"",
  "Facebook now has 2 billion users, unprecedented reach, and a CEO whose name is recognized all over the world.",
  "\"There is a sense that Mark doesn't get his hands dirty until problems are way too far down the road.\"",

  "After this story was initially published, a Facebook spokesperson provided a statement to CNN.",

  "Related: Facebook is facing an existential crisis\n\n\"It's his company.",
  "The types of problems Facebook has to solve don't have easy answers.",
  "\"We want to tell the public more...tell the hard story more.",
  "\"The entire company is outraged we were deceived.",
  "And this is a moment of crisis for Facebook.",
  "The first top-level executive echoed that.",
  "\"Every answer has tradeoffs.\""
