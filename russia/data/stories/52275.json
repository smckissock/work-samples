  "American companies under similar attack — from banks to hotels to carmakers and airlines — see data-sharing as an immensely important way Washington could be helping fortify the nation's’ cyberdefenses.",
  "The government agrees, in principle: The Department of Homeland Security has even set up a data-swapping mechanism that gives hundreds of private companies access to the government’s digital findings.",
  "And this year alone, the entire world was gripped by two unprecedented malware attacks that seized tens of thousands of computers at international companies, universities and government agencies.",
  "Under the law, DHS set up its new information-sharing portal; it now connects with more than 100 outside entities, some with thousands of members, in a constant two-way exchange of threat data.",
