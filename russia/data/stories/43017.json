  "Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent nearly 10 hours testifying before Congress this week, answering questions about how Facebook mishandled user data during the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",
  "According to Chris Hadnagy, a body language expert and the author of \"Unmasking the Social Engineer,\" Zuckerberg didn't show any signs of sadness in either his facial expressions or his body language.",
  "For instance, Hadnagy pointed out that he seemed anxious, with a slight frown, while Senator Feinstein was asking him why Facebook didn't ban Cambridge Analytica in 2015 on Day 1 of the testimony.",
  "Screenshot/C-SPAN\n\nOn Day 2 of the testimony, Hadnagy noted that Zuckerberg showed contempt when asked whether Facebook had an ethical obligation to notify millions of users of the data breach.",
  "Hadnagy has worked with Paul Ekman, a psychologist known for his research on \"microexpressions,\" or the subtle movement of facial muscles that communicate different emotions.",
  "Hadnagy said Zuckerberg's stoicism, his stick-to-the-facts approach, and his relative lack of emotion would be more appropriate if he were trying to win an argument.",
  "But given that Zuckerberg was testifying about a mistake Facebook may have made, it would have made more sense for him to show some remorse, Hadnagy said.",
  "At certain points during the testimony, Zuckerberg looked angry or anxious â€” emotions that are to be expected in such a stressful circumstance.",
  "Screenshot/C-SPAN\n\nAnd he looked relaxed, his jaw loosened, while addressing Feinstein: \"That's a great question.",
  "\"It feels like his answers were scripted as opposed to coming from a place of emotion,\" Hadnagy said.",
  "Instead, Hadnagy said, Zuckerberg looked \"stoic,\" \"controlled,\" and relatively emotionless.",
  "But he missed a prime opportunity to win back listeners and earn their forgiveness.",
  "Screenshot/C-SPAN\n\nMostly though, he looked stoic and relatively emotionless.",
  "That's because sadness typically evokes observers' sympathy and empathy.",
  "Cambridge Analytica wasn't using our services in 2015, as we can tell.\"",
  "\"They let us co-feel emotion,\" Hadnagy added.",
  "Zuckerberg, pictured, didn't look sad at all.",
  "His jaw is tight and his lips are pursed.",
  "Yet he never displayed any sadness."
