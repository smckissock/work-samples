  "The Rostec director did not say exactly when the delivery is due to take place, but earlier on Monday a colleague of Chemezov's who is also attending the Dubai Airshow told the BBC Russian Service on the condition of anonymity that the Russian side could start delivery within six months of the contract being signed.",
  "In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to suspend the ban on trading military technology with Iran under the U.N. sanctions, several months before the heaviest of sanctions were suspended in June following Tehran's decision to give international inspectors access to its nuclear program.",
  "Russia's delivery of the S-300 to Iran was initially agreed upon in 2007, but so far it has not gone ahead because the United Nations Security Council in 2010 voted to introduce tougher trade sanctions due to Tehran's refusal to curb its nuclear program.",
  "According to the BBC, the S-300 is a highly capable, long-range surface-to-air missile complex, with fully mobile units that are capable of targeting aircraft and can engage ballistic missiles.",
  "Iran filed a case in international court against Russia for not meeting its end of the deal, but Chemezov added that the case would be dropped once Russia began fulfilling the new agreement.",
  "Russia and Iran have agreed to terms for the delivery of the Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile system, the director of Russia's state defence contractor said on Monday.",
  "It was first deployed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and it is now marketed to militaries with custom upgrades on the dated model, depending on the details of the purchase.",
  "Sergey Chemezov, director of Rostec, confirmed the deal at the Dubai Airshow, according to state news agency RIA Novosti.",
  "It is not known what, if any, modifications have been made to the units to be sold to Tehran."
