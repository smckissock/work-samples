  "And how about a Senate report showing that the Trump administration has had to deal -- since he took office, the president --with 125 deep state leaks in 126 days, which, by the way, are all likely felonies and happened at a rate which is seven times greater than the previous two administrations.",
  "Now, this DNC operative, who according to Politico used to work at the Clinton White House, well, spearheaded this entire effort, including by meeting with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to go after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
  "I think in the grand scheme of the hysteria that has been talked about over the last eight, nine, 10 months with Russia, things are probably different than they were 13 months ago when there were a couple people talking about it and they launched this notion, it's just a little bit different.",
  "And then you raise the issue which I've been concerned about for a long time, and that was the whole issue of State Department funding going over to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars to a group that's running political campaigns against the Prime Minister in the state of Israel.",
  "Then there's James Comey, a report from The Hill saying that four of Comey's seven memos contained classified information and that the considers the memos to be government property, meaning that Comey may have committed two felonies, broken the law, removing those files from the FBI.",
  "I think the reason we fought so hard during this campaign, whether it was my father and the work that he put into it, whether it was the rest of our family and the efforts that we put into it -- and you know those efforts well -- it's because we'd do anything for this country.",
  "The crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.",

  "Here's a guy that leaks information, think about this, he leaks information based on conversations he had with the president of the United States, leaks them to go to a reporter through a friend of his at Columbia Law School for the sole purpose of doing what?",
  "You have been caught time and time again spreading fake news stories -- you'll be critical of all my interviews -- and you carry out your personal attacks against the president, against his family and anybody that dares to be associated with the president.",
  "Rather than report this overture by the Russian government to provide damaging information to intervene in the presidential election in a way to help his father, neither the president's son nor the campaign reported this information to the FBI.",
  "So I don't even think my sirens, you know, went up or the antennas went up at this time because of it because it wasn't the issue that it's been made out to be over the last, you know, nine months, ten months since it really became a thing.",

  "HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity\" as we continue our final moments with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAt the beginning, look, this is an opinion show but I wanted to ask every question I could think of regarding this issue.",
  "All right, so earlier today after The New York Times started reporting on the content of email exchanges prior to this meeting at Trump Tower, Donald Trump Jr., released what he says is the entire email chain.",
  "Then you go to what James Comey said when he saw the evident, that it was extreme carelessness, which, by the way, is the definition of gross negligence which is what the criminal statute has for mishandling.",
  "And instead what we've got now is Donald Trump Jr. comes forward, releases all the emails, the emails chains, and the media is in a frenzy because he released the emails, unlike the opposition, who did not.",
  "I didn't know these guys well enough to understand that if this talent manager from Miss Universe, you know, had this kind of thing -- so I wanted to hear him out and play it out and see what happens.",
  "And it was such a nothing, I literally wouldn't have remembered the meeting, especially when you think about it in the grand scheme...\n\nHANNITY: Were you annoyed when you walked out of the meeting?",
  "There was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen, and you know, in the end, there was probably some bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about.",
  "Now, the legal team also says that this Russian lawyer is connected to Fusion GPS, which is the opposition research firm that produced the discredited Christopher Steele dossier on Donald Trump.",
  "And it's worth noting, by the way, that President Trump's legal team pointed out that they think the whole meeting could have been a setup that was made to look like potential Russia collusion.",
  "And by the way, since you are so interested in prosecuting people and accusing them of crimes, well, let's talk about real crimes that have been committed that you in the media so often ignore.",

  "HANNITY: Well, and he did say -- at the end of your statement today, you did point out, as Goldstone said today, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I've ever heard.",
  "I don't know what there there is, and wouldn't every campaign, if they were told there's information, op research, isn't that what Hillary's campaign, the DNC did with Ukraine?",
  "Earlier a group of Republicans called on the majority leader to shorten or cancel the August recess to work on health care, tax reform, and the rest of their campaign promises.",
  "HANNITY: What about what the Democrats are all saying -- between the media insanity and Democrats this proves collusion and oh, my gosh, again, I will ask you as an attorney.",
  "For example, do you believe or have any doubt that Hillary Clinton committed crimes, mishandling and destroying classified, top secret special access program information?",
  "Why do you think there's this reaction that is almost like there are so many groups so opposing your father, I've never seen it in all the years I've covered politics.",
  "We now know that the response that the president's son gave to the Russians was that he would love it if they would provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.",

  "JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, first, here's the first thing I'll say, and my friend, Governor Mike Huckabee said something very similar.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Now, NBC is also quoting the Russian lawyer as saying, quote, \"I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton.",
  "One of the things you said tonight maybe not be so Trump-ian I guess in a sense, although I do think your father and you are a lot alike, you said in retrospect.",
  "Did you ever think maybe this might not be ...\n\nTRUMP JR.: Listen, I think -- like I said, in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.",
  "It was this, you know, Hey, some DNC donors may have done something and Russia and they didn't pay taxes -- I was, like, What does this have to do with anything?",
  "Was it just the pageant you met them at and the Doral concert...\n\nTRUMP JR.: That they had the pageant and they're successful real estate developers over there.",
  "They had something, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I had been hearing about but were probably underreported for years, not just during the campaign.",
  "But look, I think at the end of the day, when you look at all of the evidence, there is one thing that becomes clear, and that is no illegality in that meeting.",
  "I'd met Emin one or twice and you know, maintained a casual relationship there, talked about some potential deals, and then (ph) to that (ph) the extent of it.",
  "The media that's watching this now never told the American people about the Ukrainian story except for \"Politico\" to their credit, and a few others, not many.",
  "HANNITY: Let me go back to what Tim Kaine said -- well, if it is what you said, you're especially -- you know, we would want it released later in the summer.",
  "Or how about the WikiLeaks email that shows a Clinton a campaign ad talking about how a Chinese ambassador wanted to have a private off-the- record meeting?",
  "This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information, but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump, helped along by Aras and Emin.",
  "So you spent a lot of time talking about, and you actually said at one point that, Hey, if it turns out to say what you say it is...\n\nTRUMP JR.: Of course.",
  "You know, especially in light of everything that was out there, I was, like, This isn't ...\n\nHANNITY: Did you ever have any contact with this woman again?",
  "It just was sort of nonsensical, inane and garbled, and then quickly went on to, you know, a story about Russian adoption and how we could possibly help.",
  "TRUMP JR.: It -- it -- listen, like I said...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP JR.: ... pretty really apparent that this was not what we were in there talking about.",
  "And when we come back, we'll ask him about the Trump family, how they feel about the daily attacks against their father and everybody else by the media.",

  "At the time, I'm sitting there, Indiana had just probably happened, you know, I'm worried about hearing a contested convention, contested convention.",
  "And I know (ph) hypotheticals -- maybe you've thought about it since and since this has now become Russia, collusion, Russia collusion and et cetera.",
  "And I think the mainstream media has probably done themselves a pretty big disservice by going so far, by going so extreme, by being so sensational.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: All right, he gets the last word all week, conservative Twitter and social media sensation Terrence Williams.",

  "If there was something that came from it that was shady, if it was a danger to national security, I would obviously bring it right to someone.",
  "Did that...\n\nTRUMP JR.: Well, again, I think I gave them a little bit of time as a courtesy, so I probably heard whatever I heard in the room.",
  "You know, this is 13 months ago, before I think the rest of the world was talking about that, trying to build up this narrative about Russia.",

  "I first wanted to just have a phone call, but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet.",

  "When we come back we'll ge a legal perspective, Jay Sekulow with reaction to our exclusive interview with Donald Trump Jr. as we continue.",
  "But they have completely ignored an example of actual election interference, and I would argue probably because it involves a Democrat.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Conservative social media Twitter sensation Terrence Williams, he gives us a brand-new video.",
  "And this Trump colluding with Russia, it is all a dream, it is all a fairy tale, it is fake news, it is part of y'all denial stage.",
  "Is anybody saying, by the way, why did the DNC have their operatives meeting with the Ukrainians and actually getting information?",
  "So of course that's getting completely overshadowed, was barely reported by I think it was \"Politico\" that did the report on that.",
  "And then the president fights back a little and you in the mainstream media, are you proud of how NBC News handles things, or CNN?",
  "But I didn't know who I was meeting beforehand, never heard of the person, never got the information until they were in the room.",
  "When you read the parts about the Russian government, or Russia supporting your father, did that put off any sirens in your head?",
  "We tune in obviously, we were probably junkies before and now it's a lot harder to not take it personally, and you try to do it.",

  "And the question you people in the media need to start asking yourselves is, why don't you tell the American people every story?",

  "I also talked about a lot of other issues, the V-15 group that Obama's operatives and taxpayer dollars went to defeat Bibi.",
  "It shows you that in the heat of a political campaign groups come forward with opposition research and meetings take place.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP JR.: In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.",

  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nHANNITY: I've been told that before, but they're highly rated opening monologues...\n\nTRUMP JR.: I like it.",
  "This is pre, for example, WikiLeaks and the DNC emails...\n\nTRUMP JR.: Well, honestly, this is pre, like, Russia fever.",
  "I mean, I was probably pressing because the pretext of the meeting was, Hey, I have information about your opponent.",
  "HANNITY: Was anybody else at any point in the campaign said, Oh, I got information about Hillary, that you remember?",
  "So the media could talk about it, but show me the criminal statute that is actually met with that kind of situation.",

  "TRUMP JR.: Listen, I'd been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time.",
