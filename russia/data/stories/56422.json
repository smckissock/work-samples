  "The goal of the FARA was to minimize foreign intervention in U.S. elections by establishing a series of limitations on foreign nationals.”\n\nAlex Wong/Getty\n\nFARA also required agents of foreign principals to register with the federal government presumably, as the indictment says, so “the people of the United States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons attempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law.” (It should also be noted that the defendants are charged with several counts of fraud and identity theft).",
  "The Federal Election Commission concisely explains regulation 110.20 : “The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits any foreign national from contributing, donating or spending funds in connection with any federal, state, or local election in the United States, either directly or indirectly.”\n\nThe Commission notes that this ban “was first enacted in 1966 as part of the amendments to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), an “internal security” statute.",
  "The defendants tried to create “political intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements.”\n\nOverall the Russians hoped “to sow discord in the U.S. political system.”\n\nAs it happens, all this activity may be illegal because the Russian government supported these activities.",

  "To put it mildly, this distinction between officialdom and voters is contrary to the foundations of freedom of speech.",
  "Two of the charges - buying political advertisements and mandatory disclosure - bear on free speech.",
  "They have the ability to sort out the false from the true if they know who is behind the arguments.",
  "If voters lack this basic capacity of citizenship, why protect speech through the First Amendment?",
  "That outcome could easily be worse than whatever threat the Russians pose to American democracy.",
