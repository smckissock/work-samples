  "The difference is that while its peers were content to monetize users strictly through advertising and viewed the private data of their users as their existential lifeblood to be protected at absolutely all costs, Facebook viewed its users as digital lab rats to be monetized not just through advertising, but through creating an entire data ecosystem around which companies across the world could form businesses around harvesting and make use of its user data.",
  "To the elite technologists perched comfortably in their ivory towers, the grand utopian vision of “fixing” the rest of the world by using technology to force everyone on the planet to conform to Silicon Valley’s ideals may seem like the path to perfection, but in reality it is merely a colonial dystopia that necessarily leads to all of the uncomfortable and destructive forces that have come to confront the company’s ambitions.",
  "When it was launched earlier this year, the initiative noted that while it had expended immense effort and pulled together far-ranging teams of researchers to consider all of the incredible research that could be conducted without the knowledge and potentially against the will of Facebook’s two billion users, when it came to the ethics of that research, every single last question about ethics was “to be determined” later on.",
  "In the end, it seems for all the company’s talk about “putting privacy first” and restoring some level of control to its users, its statements were all just empty words as it moves aggressively to knock down the final protective barriers that offered the last shreds of privacy to its users and makes the entirety of its two billion users’ most private and intimate data available to the world’s academics to mine.",
  "The only hope we have left is for governments to intervene and force Facebook to scale back its ambitions of turning us all into digital lab rats, transition it from a dictatorship into a democracy and force it to turn its promises into reality through greater transparency and a shift from treating \"privacy\" as an empty marketing word into a guiding principle that governs everything it does.",
  "Facebook and its Silicon Valley brethren have been showing us creepily personalized advertisements for years and while those ads and the vast data repositories behind them have garnered headlines periodically, it was Facebook’s willing role as a data broker and its unwillingness to tackle misuse of its platform that led it to become the public face of surveillance society gone wrong.",
  "Similarly, the contours of what constituted \"acceptable speech\" was left to the governments of the world to determine for their respective societies, ensuring that in countries with free speech their rich systems of checks and balances and appeals processes meant that all voices could be heard, not just those that brought in the greatest monetary profits.",
  "While other major web companies provide productivity and analytics capabilities to political campaigns, it was Facebook that permitted Obama’s campaign to hoover up the private information of an entire fraction of the United States’ electorate without their knowledge or consent and saw absolutely nothing wrong with that mass harvesting.",
  "Unsurprisingly, Facebook declined to comment on any of the questions, including those related to how it intended to prevent malicious state actors from exploiting the new program to achieve results similar to the 2016 election interference, but with vastly greater effect through active manipulation of Facebook's algorithms themselves.",
  "Rather than redouble its efforts to protect its users from unauthorized misuse of their data, Facebook has gone entirely in the other direction, declaring open season on its two billion users, making their most intimate and private communications and behaviors available to academics across the world to mine and manipulate.",
  "The company’s supporters rushed to its defense, mounting impassioned proclamations that Mark Zuckerberg alone is best suited to lead a quarter of the world’s population and that only he could possibly wield the responsibility for governing what amounts to a global digital dictatorship of two billion people.",
  "Instead of demanding that the entire planet conform its ideas, beliefs and speech to the ideals of a single white western male of privileged upbringing, the web allowed us to celebrate our differences and bring us together to the degree we were comfortable, letting us retain that which was important to us.",
  "To Facebook, its vast archives of private intimate user data was not merely for it to monetize into advertisements, it was a rich treasure trove of incalculable monetary value that could be used to forge an entire ecosystem of companies with Facebook at the center of the new centralized web.",
  "Unlike Estonia’s data model which enshrines informed consent and user control over their data as absolute guarantees, Facebook’s new academic research program violates the most central ethical tenant that previously governed modern acceptable human subjects research: informed consent.",
  "As the company prepares the hire up to an additional 20,000 content moderators this year, the company’s newfound interest in moderation staffing raises the question of why Facebook didn’t hire all of these additional moderators years ago before the threat of government intervention.",
  "Peeling back the hype and hyperbole, the existential question to Facebook’s future isn’t whether Mark Zuckerberg is the right iron-fisted dictator to rule this digital dictatorship, but rather whether we should have such a centralized unaccountable dictatorship at all.",
  "One might assume that a company in the midst of a privacy firestorm and which has announced that it is “putting privacy first” would move aggressively to restrict access to private intimate user data, not expand the number of people who can mass access it.",
  "After years of protesting that it could do no more to combat hate speech in Germany, changes in the legal landscape caused the company to act almost overnight, rapidly increasing its moderation staff and adding a wealth of new tools and features.",
  "The question isn't whether Zuckerberg is the right ruler of the Facebook world, but rather whether the company's model of seeing its users as both advertising revenue and marketable data streams is where we want our world to head.",
  "Every one of the troubles confronting Facebook at the moment, from privacy to misinformation campaigns, terrorism recruiting to revenge porn, hate speech to acceptable conduct clashes are all a byproduct of its centralized design.",
  "This decentralized web allowed the world’s cultures to retain what makes them unique while at the same time connecting them and permitting the free flow of ideas with local control over the borders of those informational flows.",
  "In essence, if you are a Facebook user your data will be mined by academics across the world whether you like it or not and no matter how strongly you protest and you have absolutely no right or ability of any kind to opt-out.",
  "In light of Facebook’s claimed new privacy-centric focus, last week I asked the company the same research ethics questions that I asked Social Science One this past April that had resulted only in “to be determined” responses.",
  "Unsurprisingly, when asked whether the company would commit to allowing users to opt out of having their data used for research, including by the new Social Science One initiative, the company once again declined to comment.",
  "The web was built upon a decentralized design that at its core accepted that we are all different across the world and that the web should embrace those differences and leave moderation and enforcement at the local level.",
  "Given the initiative’s single-minded focus on research outcomes, while ethical considerations are left to the future, this raises the question of how the new initiative fits with Facebook’s new “privacy first” vision.",
  "As the technology press and pundits digested this week’s precipitous collapse of Facebook’s stock price, headlines have largely linked the collapse to Facebook’s privacy and safety woes coming home to roost.",
  "Does this portend the end of social media or rather the final closing chapter in our quaint flirtation with the dream that the online world might bring with it democracy, privacy and a more informed public?",
  "The increasing impact of the profit versus privacy battle at the center of the Cambridge Analytica story and the growing inability of Facebook to control its platform and protect it from harmful misuse.",
  "Terrorism, hate speech and other illegal conduct was delegated by the web to the court systems of the world that have the power to punish such speech, not merely delete it in whack-a-mole fashion.",
  "Even Twitter sells access only to its public user data, going out of its way to emphasize that private user communications like direct messages are never made available to others for data mining.",
  "In light of the company’s new focus on “putting privacy first” this raises the question of whether it will finally restore to users some degree of control over how their private data is used.",
  "Yet, it is important to recognize that it is not those troubles themselves, but rather the impact of those woes on profit that were what so concerned investors and triggered the sell off.",
  "Indeed, nearly every major announcement Facebook has made relating to privacy, security or content moderation has come after government scrutiny and threats of enhanced regulation.",
  "It was Facebook again that permitted a single academic to hoover up its data and the only thing it saw wrong with the situation is that he shared the data with a third party.",
  "Unsurprisingly, the company declined to comment, as it has to past questions about why it hasn’t taken moderation more seriously until faced with legal obligations to do so.",
  "In contrast, the majority of the issues facing Facebook today stem from its centralized approach to building a single governance structure that subjugates the entire planet.",
  "Perhaps the greatest reason is the increasing scrutiny of government regulators and the enactment and threat of enactment of new legislation that forced the company to act.",
  "In the past, the company has steadfastly declined to comment on whether it would allow its two billion users to request that their private data not be used for research.",
  "While other web companies hold vastly richer and more intimate data than Facebook, they use that data strictly to show us ads, never allowing others to make use of it.",
  "One of the biggest tech stories of the past week was the abrupt implosion of Facebook’s stock price after it warned investors of slowing growth and profit margins.",
  "After all, most of the world has moved beyond absolute dictatorships in which one individual wields absolute and total control with accountability to none.",
  "Such statements ignore the most central and existential question of all – why on earth should that much power be centralized under one single person?",
  "In short, the world no longer cares about declining privacy or increasing misuse so long as those issues don’t affect Silicon Valley's profitability.",
  "Why would Facebook embark upon a mission to, as its CFO put it last week, “pu[t] privacy first” if prioritizing privacy risked impacting its profits?",
  "Government regulation seems to be the one constant in forcing social media companies to take issues from data misuse to content moderation seriously.",
  "Users will have no right to know what research projects are using their personal private information and have no ability to opt-out of that use.",
  "Most importantly, control was delegated to the local level, with no single individual able to control what the entire planet could see or say.",
  "Apart from its centralized nature, why does Facebook seem to be bearing the brunt of the contemporary conversation around privacy and misuse?",
  "Had the Trump campaign itself performed the data harvesting, Facebook noted that there would have been absolutely nothing wrong at all.",
  "It was the idea that granting more privacy and taking more control over data use might impede profits.",
  "After all, its advertising supported model is what powers much of Silicon Valley’s web companies.",
  "Yet, that is precisely what the company has done through its new academic research initiative.",

  "In other words, that privacy and profit might be mutually exclusive.",
  "At the center of its pessimistic outlook?"
