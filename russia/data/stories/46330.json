  "“If you’re setting the consequences of someone’s behaviors and you tie those consequences to learning machines so that the consequences shift according to individual markers, you really do have exquisite control over shaping that individual’s behavior–over how he spends his time.”\n\nFogg, the behavior scientist who helped pioneer the study of computer-based persuasive technology in the mid-’90s, warned in his 1998 Stanford doctoral thesis about potential ethical problems arising from this work.",
  "What’s good for corporate profits is not necessarily what’s good for human health or society, Brown points out, adding, “And that’s where this conversation has to start.”\n\nBoundless Mind’s business model is to develop new versions of the same persuasive tools, combined with machine learning, that big tech firms already use–and then to sell them to nonprofits and companies promoting education, health or social welfare.",
  "In order for the therapy to work, explained AppliedVR co-founder Matthew Stoudt, patients must ultimately find the interface addictive, at least on some level, so that “they want to keep coming back.” Boundless Mind’s technology will help AppliedVR learn from patients’ past behavior in order to personalize the interface, making it uniquely rewarding for each user.",
  "Boundless Mind, founded in 2015, has 10 employees and operates out of a one-car garage near Venice Beach Scott Witter for TIME\n\nThis business model has driven an explosion of interest in what’s known as persuasive technology, a relatively new field of research that studies how computers can be used to control human thoughts and actions.",
  "Last year, the American Psychological Association found that 65% of us believe that periodically unplugging would improve our mental health, and a 2017 University of Texas study found that the mere presence of our smartphones, face down on the desk in front of us, undercuts our ability to perform basic cognitive tasks.",
  "Participants, who pay up to $1,700 for the three-day conference, are given “practical steps” on how to design “habit-forming products.”\n\nThis idea–that app developers are competing with one another to create ever more addictive products–isn’t so much an embarrassing secret as a starting point, says Zichermann.",
  "Former Google employee Tristan Harris and early Facebook investor Roger McNamee have accused the tech giants of deliberately creating addictive products, without regard for human or social health, and this year, two major Apple shareholders publicly called on the company to design a less-addictive iPhone.",
  "In Germany, a growing number of corporations, including Volkswagen and BMW, have begun restricting how employees can send or receive nonemergency emails after hours, and in Brooklyn, a tiny device manufacturer, Light, is promoting a new “dumb phone” that does little more than make calls.",
  "“Not just at the level of some New York Times best seller–‘Do something for 30 days, it’ll stick!’–but at a fundamental, academic level.”\n\nOne day at their office, Brown walked over to a whiteboard, drew an outline of a human brain in orange marker and turned to face Combs and me.",
  "As I was on the phone with Dyson, Facebook’s beleaguered CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, posted his first public statement since news broke that the data firm Cambridge Analytica had used millions of people’s personal Facebook data, without their permission, to aid the 2016 Trump campaign.",
  "The field, which draws on advances in neuroscience and behavioral psychology, has fueled the creation of thousands of apps, interfaces and devices that deliberately encourage certain human behaviors (keep scrolling) while discouraging others (convey thoughtful, nuanced ideas).",
  "New York University psychologist Adam Alter describes the current state of tech obsession as a “full-blown epidemic.”\n\nThe problem, critics agree, begins with Silicon Valley’s unique business model, which relies on keeping us in the thrall of our screens.",
  "But now, he notes, “we are surrounded by persuasive technologies.”\n\nEvery major consumer tech company operating today–from behemoths like Amazon to the lone programmer building the next Candy Crush–uses some form of persuasive technology.",
  "In San Francisco, “technology mindfulness” conferences, like Wisdom 2.0, have sprung up alongside tech-free private schools, tech-free meet-ups, and apps like Moment and Onward, which are designed to help people curb their phone use.",
  "When the brain gets some sort of external cue, like the ding of a Facebook notification, that often precedes a reward, the basal ganglia receive a burst of dopamine, a powerful neurotransmitter linked to the anticipation of pleasure.",
  "When two people send and receive Snaps with each other for days on end, both receive emoji flames next to their names, alongside a number, which ticks up every 24 hours, indicating how long the two have maintained their connection.",
  "Scientists don’t yet know how using smartphones for hours every day affects our brains Gijsbert van der Wal\n\nBoundless Mind, founded in 2015 as Dopamine Labs, has raised $1.5 million and boasts just 10 employees and 14 customers.",
  "“Otherwise, it’s just trapped inside Facebook, and only they get to use it.” As virtual reality becomes more ubiquitous, persuasive technologies will become increasingly precise, personalized and effective, Brown and Combs say.",
  "He signs his emails with emojis–a bear, a red heart, a sun–describes himself on the company’s website as an “escaped circus bear” and favors collared shirts unbuttoned to the sternum, revealing a tan wilderness of chest hair.",
  "If you’re trying to get someone to establish a new behavior–“to really glue it in tight”–computer engineers can draw on different kinds of positive feedback, like social approval or a sense of progress, to build on that loop.",

  "It ensures that users always see a partial image of what comes next, which tantalizes our curiosity and deprives us of any natural stopping point, while simultaneously offering an endless well of new content.",
  "On the morning I visited, in March, it was populated by a dozen screens–phones, tablets, monitors–and half as many 20-something engineers, all of whom were male and bearded, and one of whom wore a cowboy hat.",
  "They then tweaked the interface to reflect those findings, making it alternately more frustrating–so that users would pay to skip a level–or rewarding, doling out freebies to users in danger of giving up.",
  "And unlike older media, which were essentially passive, our smartphones actively surveil us; they track our steps, log our GPS locations, note nearby devices and file away our clicks, likes and comments.",
  "Why not harness those same, powerful persuasive technologies that Big Tech has in its arsenal but, instead of deploying them to maximize eyeball time, use them to promote a healthy, democratic society?",
  "They posted six questions on a blog–including “Are the actions that drive value for the publisher the same actions that drive value for the user?”–in part, they said, to keep themselves accountable.",

  "Their friendship was born over beers and a mutual disappointment in what are known as behavior-change apps–tools designed to help people commit to certain actions, like dieting or quitting smoking.",
  "But they don’t solve the basic problem–that tech firms, both big and small, now wield extraordinary control over what billions of us see and hear, how we communicate and ultimately how we behave.",
  "Brown and Combs refer to this as “bottomless bowl” design, a reference to a 2005 Cornell University study that found that participants ate 73% more soup when their bowls secretly self-refilled.",
  "“No piece of technology, once adopted, ever gets put back in the box.” Instead, he and Combs propose a different tactic, born of the relentless optimism of Silicon Valley: fight fire with fire.",
  "“Your kid’s brain is being engineered to get him to stay on his phone.”\n\nIn the past year, Silicon Valley insiders have raised the alarm about the real-world impact of all this persuasive tech.",
  "While the company is still small–it has a valuation of just about $5 million–Dyson and the other investors are willing to leave cash on the table if it means “doing the right thing,” she said.",
  "Advertisers, studio producers, magicians and salesmen, to name just a few who have traditionally made their living through persuasion, have long relied on vulnerabilities in the human psyche.",
  "It’s our habits and addictions.”\n\nEvery day, we check our phones an average of 47 times–every 19 minutes of our waking lives–and spend roughly five hours total peering at their silvery glow.",
  "No matter how long you scroll down on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, and no matter how many hours you spend watching YouTube or Netflix, there is always more content cued up to auto-play.",

  "By 2016, users were spending an average of 50 minutes per day, a staggering portion of the average person’s leisure time, on three of its platforms: Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.",
  "The longer we are glued to an app–a value nicknamed eyeball time–the more money its creators make by selling our attention and access to our personal data to advertisers and others.",
  "Product designers then use that data, alongside machine-learning tools, to study how we react to certain interfaces, rewards and inputs, and to identify patterns in our behaviors.",
  "“We spend many hours engaged with them, but all the analysis of us happens behind closed doors.”\n\nBrown and Combs hope that Boundless Mind provides something of a counterbalance.",
  "As cloud computing has gotten cheaper and machine-learning tools have gotten easier to use, even small tech companies can now analyze their users’ behavior at a granular level.",
  "Last year, they turned down a client from a horse-betting website, a decision that Esther Dyson, a New York–based venture capitalist who funds Boundless Mind, applauded.",
  "Combs and Brown call it engineering “surprise and delight.”\n\nMost of the alluring apps and websites in wide use today were engineered to exploit this habit-forming loop.",
  "Combs, who takes a backseat to Brown as the company’s de facto spokesperson, tends to answer questions with numbers and data, his hands twitching toward a tablet nearby.",

  "Snapchat, for example, which relies heavily on the trigger-action-reward triumvirate, also uses a powerful trick to get users to open the app daily.",
  "That allows them to identify not only which factors affect engagement by a typical user but also which factors most affect each user personally.",

  "With each interaction, users have left digital traces of themselves, which together create detailed portraits of who they are, as individuals.",
  "'” On an earnings call in April last year, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told investors that his company’s main competition was customers’ sleep.",
  "It should be no secret, for example, that casinos, which have no clocks or outside windows, are designed to eliminate external stopping cues.",

  "Fogg, a Stanford University behavior scientist who was one of the first academics to seriously study how computers influence human behavior.",
  "The brain, he explained, sounding like the graduate teaching assistant he once was, has two basic neural pathways for controlling behavior.",
  "But over the years, many outsiders have come to regard his research as something of an instruction manual for how to create addictive apps.",
  "But she highlighted a number of recent tweaks to the company’s carefully tuned interface, which have had a profound effect on our behavior.",
  "But viewed another way, it’s about the intentional, aggressive cultivation and harvesting of that data through persuasive technology.",
  "By developing persuasive-technology tools “and then releasing them to everybody,” Brown says, they want to level the playing field.",
  "“Why can’t we engineer your brain to be who you want to be?”\n\nThe founders of Boundless Mind are in some ways a study in opposites.",

  "A Facebook spokesperson did not respond to questions from TIME about the use of persuasive technology on the platform.",
  "(The firm was said initially to have lifted 50 million profiles; Facebook has since revised the number to 87 million.)",
  "“They need to resist the temptation to use their technology for the wrong purposes.”\n\nThat’s easier said than done.",
  "That’s largely because those vast databases of user behavior owned by big tech firms like Facebook are proprietary.",

  "“We already know how to engineer your brain to be a good little social-media user,” he says.",
  "The tech startup is run out of a one-car garage a few blocks from California’s Venice Beach.",
  "Their objection is to how it is being used primarily by tech giants to boost eyeball time.",
  "While many see that imminent future as something of a dystopia, they see it as promising.",
  "That allows them to predict, fairly precisely, Brown says, how we’ll react in the future.",
  "Facebook sells that microtargeted access to advertisers, political campaigns and others.",
  "When it comes to Facebook’s impact on our lives, those tweaks may be a good thing.",
