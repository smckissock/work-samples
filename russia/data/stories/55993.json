  "“What’s happening is a disgrace and at some point – I wanted to stay out, but at some point, if it doesn’t straighten out properly, I will get involved and I’ll get in there if I have to.”\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Beast published Thursday, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani revealed he is putting together a “counter-report,” about Mueller’s illegitimacy as special counsel “There is no [secret] grand jury material here… It’ll be our report, put out on… personal stationery, and it would be in response to their report… We may have to use it in court, or [send to] Congress,” he told the news outlet.",
  "“[P]ut more precisely, the only thing illegal about that meeting was how the woman got in the country, how she got a visa from the Obama State Department, and why she was meeting with an official from Fusion GPS before and after the Trump Tower meeting.”\n\nMic’s Eric Lutz raised the possibility that Mueller could drop a bombshell on Friday or up until September 7, citing the Justice Department’s unofficial policy of taking action within 60 days of an election.",
  "Tomorrow is the last business day of the pre-Labor Day to Election Day window.”\n\nTodd, seemingly unable to help himself from further hyping the bombshell, concluded the panel discussion, asking, “Not to be totally cliché, but 5 o’clock tomorrow is a big deadline, isn’t it?”\n\nKyle Griffin, a producer for MSNBC’s Last Word, amplified Todd’s warning, tweeting an article about the NBC host’s remarks to his nearly 470,000 followers.",
  "I am being targeted not because I committed a crime, but because the ‘deep state’ liberals want to silence me and pressure me to testify against my good friend President Donald J. Trump.”\n\nRoger Stone's latest pitch to his email list of supporters boils down to this: Donate right now because, literally, I am the next guy to get indicted.",
  "“Those were the two topics that were mentioned to me by lawyers close to this investigation when they talked about what might happen today.”\n\nIn a recent email sent to supporters, Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump ally, warned the special counsel will indict him next.",
  "Further, a whopping 80 percent of Republicans polled concur with President Donald Trump that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.”\n\nThe poll, commissioned by Public Policy Polling between August 27-28, 2018, possesses a margin of error of +/- 4.1%.",
  "“The plea deal was handled by the DC US Attorney’s Office and the Justice Department’s National Security Division, not Mueller’s team, which is about to take former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to trial on a similar charge,” reported CNN.",

  "pic.twitter.com/sWAx2BQtSJ — Marshall Cohen (@MarshallCohen) August 26, 2018\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last week, Stone also predicted Mueller may soon indict Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, for a process crime.",
  "“[A]nalysts have suggested he may follow the 60-day rule to avoid the appearance of political bias, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused him of in his relentless broadsides against the Russia probe,” wrote Lutz.",
  "“The criminal charging document does not name Manafort or any of his colleagues in the US and Ukraine, though Patten may be connected to those efforts.”\n\nAs one can tell, Patten’s indictment is far from a bombshell.",

  "“Our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job, doing it right, and doing it now because people are angry,” the president said before a packed house of cheering attendees.",
  "“In my opinion, absolutely nothing in this would prohibit or constrain Mueller from charging Roger Stone or anyone else connected to the Trump campaign in the next six weeks,” he said.",
  "According to various mainstream media figures this week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was all but certain to drop a bombshell Friday that would shake Washington, D.C., to its core.",
  "Patten is said to have been paid over $1 million for lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party referred to as the “Opposition Bloc,” between 2014-2017.",
  "Meanwhile, a new poll reported by Axios shows two-thirds of Republicans and one-third of independents believe it’s time for the Mueller probe to come to an end.",
  "“Not a single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him, wouldn’t say that he would have ended this investigation if there was no collusion.",
  "Axios national political reporter Jonathan Swan was “right in his question that there is speculation both about Roger Stone and Wikileaks,” Allen said.",
  "He would have already ended this investigation.”\n\n“We can’t tell that, though, until he tells us,” GOP ad-maker Brad Todd replied.",
