  "(CNN) Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker warned Monday there will be \"a lot happening\" in Congress on Saudi Arabia, including a vote as soon as this week calling for an end to US involvement in Yemen, as he renewed demands for CIA Director Gina Haspel to brief senators this week about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.",
  "Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring at the end of his term in January, suggested that the planned Wednesday briefing from Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alone would not be sufficient in answering the growing number of questions about Khashoggi's death.",
  "And Corker said he was looking at making \"some enhancements\" to a request for the Trump administration to investigate whether bin Salman committed human rights violations and should be slapped with sanctions under the federal Magnitsky Act.",
  "Corker also said that there could be action in his committee as soon as Wednesday on Saudi Arabia, though senators are still discussing what legislative proposals could come up during that meeting.",
  "Moreover, Corker said that they may look at \"additional legislation\" targeting the crown prince, potentially even by attaching spending legislation Congress must clear by December 7.",
  "Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent; Mike Lee, a Utah Republican; and Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat -- to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.",
  "Questions still remain over how strongly Congress should respond in attempting to punish the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over the murder.",
  "That measure was tabled, 55-44, earlier this year, but its chances of passing are stronger now in light of the Khashoggi murder.",
  "At the same time, Corker said that he expected the Senate to vote this week on a privileged resolution -- authored by Sens.",
