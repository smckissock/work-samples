  "Stephanie Keith/Reuters\n\nMichael Cohen, one of President Donald Trump's top lawyers reportedly organized a Delaware-based limited-liability company to transfer a $130,000 payment to the adult-film star \"Stormy Daniels,\" who claimed that she had a sexual encounter with Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.",
  "To get that payment to a lawyer representing the porn actor, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, Cohen created the company, Essential Consultants LLC, on October 17, 2016 and used a bank account attached to the company to transfer the money.",
  "The alleged encounter between Daniels and Trump happened at a July 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, according to an earlier report from the Journal.",
  "Delaware is a favored venue for limited-liability company transactions because it does not require that people connected to the entities be publicly identified.",
  "In Touch published its story in 2011, allegedly before a nondisclosure agreement between Clifford and Trump went into effect.",
  "The payment was delivered in October 2016, just before Trump won the US election in a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton.",
  "The Journal reported that Cohen also attached pseudonyms to Clifford in reference to the transaction.",
  "Clifford has talked about her alleged encounter before, with In Touch Magazine and others.",
  "She also talked to a Fox News reporter about her encounter with Trump.",
  "The network reportedly shelved the story before the 2016 election.",
  "Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump's attorneys.",
  "Cohen denies this, according to the newspaper.",
  "Fox News denies that claim."
