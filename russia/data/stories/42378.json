  "Rather, it appears that Aleksandr Kogan, who wore dual hats as a psychology researcher with Cambridge University and as an entrepreneur, collected the data through a third-party app on the Facebook platform, using Facebook’s API under the auspices of being an academic.",

  "Facebook’s announcement came the day before two explosive reports in the Guardian and the New York Times showed that Facebook had had knowledge of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called “unauthorized” use of user data for years and yet had done nothing in response.",
  "However, Facebook has stated that Cambridge Analytica’s access of Facebook user data was “unauthorized.” This is likely because admitting that it allowed Cambridge Analytica to access the data could also open Facebook to liability.",
  "LOIC VENANCE/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, a controversial research and data analysis firm, due to unauthorized access and use of Facebook’s user data.",
  "In response to this scandal, policymakers, including U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, are now calling for investigations into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.",
  "However, blaming Facebook and other tech companies for privacy harms is not effective if the government doesn’t create consistent, actionable standards—both rights and regulations for companies.",
  "By claiming that Cambridge Analytica’s data use was both not a breach and yet also unauthorized, Facebook is making a shrewd move that may help the company avoid or ameliorate some liability.",
  "It could be forced to pay fines, and the company would have to follow certain obligations, including notifying users and providing remedies that could include identity protection services.",
  "Lawmakers have long been pressuring tech companies to do more to solve a wide variety of problems, including harassment, privacy violations, media manipulation, and election interference.",
  "Another way Facebook could have prevented this scandal is giving users more information on how third-party apps use their data and offering more choices to users on how to manage it.",
  "Even more controversially, Cambridge Analytica has been, at times, linked to the Trump presidential campaign and to foreign interests, potentially in violation of U.S. election laws.",
  "Facebook’s statement also arrived on the same day as a new lawsuit filed in the U.K. from a professor alleging harms from Cambridge Analytica using his Facebook data to profile him.",
  "But if the public really cares about preventing this kind of privacy violation, we need to change our social understanding of privacy and how data should be collected and used.",
  "In various statements by Facebook and its executives, the company has claimed that there was no “data breach” involved, but that user data was used in an unauthorized manner.",
  "The Federal Trade Commission would also likely enforce a fine or other legal consequences on Facebook, as it regularly does for organizations that suffer data breaches.",
  "Some, including Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, are even calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress.",
  "This distinction matters because lawmakers will likely be looking for someone to blame for whatever privacy harms were caused by Cambridge Analytica’s data profiling.",
  "Ultimately, responsibility should fall on the shoulders of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, the U.S. government, and even ourselves as consumers.",
  "(Reporters from the Guardian note that both they and the New York Times had been in contact with Facebook before the articles were published.)",
  "Tech companies like Facebook also have to navigate a confusing array of different, often conflicting privacy laws from different countries.",
  "You can blame Cambridge Analytica for using your data, or Facebook for collecting your data, or the government for not regulating either.",
  "If Cambridge Analytica was not authorized to use Facebook’s data, the blame would likely fall solely or mostly on Cambridge Analytica.",
  "If Facebook authorized Cambridge Analytica’s use of data, that would mean at least some of the blame would be allocated to Facebook.",
  "Admitting there was a data breach would effectively be the equivalent of admitting that Facebook was at least somewhat at fault.",
  "These pressures have intensified in the wake of the 2016 election, as exemplified by the tense Senate tech hearings last fall.",
  "In response to Facebook’s statements, Cambridge Analytica has claimed that it only accessed and used data in authorized ways.",
  "The site’s features would also be less personalized to users, which would likely make their experiences less engaging.",
  "Facebook’s core defense rests on the fact that Facebook did not directly transfer user data to Cambridge Analytica.",
  "In return, we reap the benefits of many new technologies, including technologies that rely on use of personal data.",
  "The story is still developing, and it’s not yet clear who should be held responsible for any harms to consumers.",
  "One could also argue that consumers simply don’t care that much about privacy and don’t care to learn more.",
  "Facebook’s Friday announcement appears to be an attempt to get ahead of the news that broke on Saturday.",
  "Otherwise, we should stop being surprised when our most personal information is inevitably misused.",
  "But who is at fault for what Facebook claims is an “unauthorized” use of Facebook user data?",
  "If there was no breach, it would seem to follow that data was accessed with permission.",
  "However, it’s likely that even Facebook would admit that it is somewhat at fault here.",
  "A picture taken on Dec. 28, 2016, in Vertou, western France, shows logos of Facebook.",
  "State laws on cybersecurity and data breaches would apply to Facebook in that case.",
  "We have created the privacy environment that allows for these violations to happen.",
  "Users should be able to understand where their data goes and who has access to it.",
  "Without user data, advertisers would be less inclined to advertise on Facebook.",
  "Is Facebook or Cambridge Analytica (or perhaps, another party) responsible?",
  "This question is more complicated than it might appear at first glance.",
  "Governments could also do more to stop this kind of privacy violation.",
  "Ultimately, some responsibility should also fall to us, as consumers.",
