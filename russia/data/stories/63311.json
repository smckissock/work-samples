  "He told Fox News he has nothing to hide and wants to cooperate with the U.S. government, adding that he has hidden two gigabytes of data that is “too hot” and “it is a matter of national security.”\n\nIn early April, at the time of Lazar’s extradition from a Romanian prison where he already was serving a seven-year sentence for cyber-crimes, a former senior FBI official said the timing was striking.",
  "Lazar spoke extensively about Blumenthal’s account, noting his emails were “interesting” and had information about “the Middle East and what they were doing there.”\n\nAfter first writing to the accused hacker on April 19, Fox News accepted two collect calls from him, over a seven-day period, before meeting with him in person at the jail.",
  "While Lazar's claims cannot be independently verified, three computer security specialists, including two former senior intelligence officials, said the process described is plausible and the Clinton server, now in FBI custody, may have an electronic record that would confirm or disprove Guccifer’s claims.",
  "He also warned: \"Unfortunately, in this community, a lot people make up stories and it's hard to tell what's really true until you get into the forensics information and get hard facts.”\n\nFor Lazar, a plea agreement where he cooperates in exchange for a reduced sentence would be advantageous.",
  "It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims.”\n\nThe former secretary of state’s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the “Top Secret” level.",
  "Former State Department IT staffer Bryan Pagliano, who installed and maintained the server, has been granted immunity by the Department of Justice and is cooperating with the FBI in its ongoing criminal investigation into Clinton’s use of the private server.",
  "If you don‘t have them all on, or the right one in the right locations, you won’t see what you are looking for.”\n\nGourley said the logs may not tell the whole story and the hard drives, three years after the fact, may not have a lot of related data left.",
  "“Because of the proximity to Sidney Blumenthal and the activity involving Hillary’s emails, [the timing] seems to be something beyond curious,” said Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division from 2012-2014.",
  "He has pleaded not guilty to a nine-count federal indictment for his alleged hacking crimes in the U.S. Victims are not named in the indictment but reportedly include Colin Powell, a member of the Bush family and others including Blumenthal.",

  "EXCLUSIVE: The infamous Romanian hacker known as “Guccifer,” speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily – and repeatedly – breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal email server in early 2013.",

  "The 44-year-old Lazar said he first compromised Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal's AOL account, in March 2013, and used that as a stepping stone to the Clinton server.",
  "\"For me, it was easy ... easy for me, for everybody,\" Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker \"Guccifer,\" told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.",
  "An intelligence source told Fox News last month that Lazar also could help the FBI make the case that Clinton’s email server may have been compromised by a third party.",
  "“For example, when Sidney Blumenthal got an email, I checked the email pattern from Hillary Clinton, from Colin Powell from anyone else to find out the originating IP.",
  "The federal indictment Lazar faces in the U.S. for cyber-crimes specifically alleges he used \"a proxy server located in Russia\" for the Blumenthal compromise.",
  "On whether the Clinton security logs would show a compromise, Wright made the comparison to a bank heist: \"Let’s say only one camera was on in the bank.",
  "For me, it was not like the Hillary Clinton server, it was like an email server she and others were using with political voting stuff,\" Guccifer said.",
  "Asked what he would say to those skeptical of his claims, Lazar cited “the evidence you can find in the Guccifer archives as far as I can remember.\"",
  "Lazar identified programs like netscan, Netmap, Wireshark and Angry IP, though it was not possible to confirm independently which, if any, he used.",

  "As recently as this week, Clinton said neither she nor her aides had been contacted by the FBI about the criminal investigation.",
  "He said he accessed Clinton’s server “like twice,” though he described the contents as “not interest[ing]” to him at the time.",
  "In describing the process, Lazar said he did extensive research on the web and then guessed Blumenthal’s security question.",
  "Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright observed, \"The Blumenthal account gave [Lazar] a road map to get to the Clinton server.",
  "Lazar emphasized that he used readily available web programs to see if the server was “alive” and which ports were open.",

  "\"As far as I remember, yes, there were … up to 10, like, IPs from other parts of the world,” he said.",
  "Each Internet Protocol (IP) address has a unique numeric code, like a phone number or home address.",

  "Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar’s claims.",
