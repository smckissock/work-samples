  "In addition: “A Canadian Parliamentary Committee has recommended extending privacy law to political parties and the US is considering introducing its first comprehensive data protection law.”",
  "While Denham welcomes voluntary initiatives by the social media platforms, she said a self-regulatory approach “will not guarantee consistency, rigour or shore up public confidence”.",
  "Trust and confidence in the integrity of our democratic processes risks being disrupted because the average person has little idea of what is going on behind the scenes.",
