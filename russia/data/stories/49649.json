  "Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?",
  "If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place.",
  "Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.",
  "Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.",
  "Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.",
  "But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.",
  "And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.",
  "Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company.",
  "In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted.",
  "The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted.",
  "Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference?",
  "In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet.",
  "That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution.",
  "This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.",
  "What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data?",
  "With whom else might it have shared it?",
  "Should we all just leave Facebook?",
  "This wasn’t informed consent."
