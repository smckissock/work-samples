  "That is a lot to cram into nine minutes of late night television, and it’s a tribute to Meyers that he makes it through so much news and necessary context while still finding time to make a joke about the president hiring lawyers named “Harder” and “Stonerock” to sue an adult actress.",
  "But it doesn’t seem like the pace of the news is likely to slow down soon, so sooner or later, the show will have to either narrow its focus or hire the Micro Machine man.",
  "Back in the pre-Trump era, the show’s “A Closer Look” segments were often reserved for a John-Oliver-style piece on a single topic (hence the title, presumably).",
  "But they’ve long since been broadened into “Weekend Update” type overviews in an attempt to keep up with the manic pace of our national implosion.",
  "On Mondays, Meyers has three days of new developments to cram in, and the result is as much fun as watching Lucy and Ethel at the candy factory.",
  "• McCabe’s claim that he has memos about his meetings with Trump and Trump’s reaction.",
  "• Trump’s incentives and possible consequences if he fires Robert Mueller.",
  "Monday episodes of Late Night with Seth Meyers are a special treat.",
  "• Trump’s inconsistency about how well he knows Putin.",
  "• Trump’s Twitter tirade against Robert Mueller.",
  "• Facebook suspending Cambridge Analytica.",
  "• Trump’s tweets about Andrew McCabe.",
  "• Trump firing James Comey.",
  "• Trump firing McCabe."
