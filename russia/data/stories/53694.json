  "Late May and early June 2016, near the end of the 2016 Republican primaries, was an intensely busy time for Don, Jr. During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front runner Hillary Clinton in her dealings with Russia.",
  "Let’s demonstrate by using an example that’s probably familiar to most readers: the movie “Ocean’s Eleven.” Here is how the lead character in that movie might describe its central heist at a similar level of detail:\n\nThe Danny Ocean equivalent:\n\n“I made a brief stop at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip.",
  "Ocean and nine friends did indeed plan an interesting night out in Las Vegas.”\n\nFriday, later in the day\n\nThe attorney then called NBC News with an update: There was a third person not from the Trump campaign in the room as well; that’s the person referred to above.",
  "(Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nAs we learn more details about the June 9, 2016, meeting involving Donald Trump’s son, son-in-law, campaign chairman and a Russian lawyer, it’s worth revisiting how Donald Trump Jr.’s depiction of what happened at that meeting has evolved.",
  "We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.",
  "Further, at no time was there ever any understanding or commitment that he, or anyone else, would find the information, whatever it turned out to be, to be reliable, credible or of interest, or would even survive due diligence.",
  "We had a meeting in June 2016.” “After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton.",
  "But I left the casino with no more money than when I entered.”\n\nMonday, July 10\n\nThe Times reports that emails exist in which Trump Jr. is told that the intelligence is part of a Russian effort to help his father.",
  "He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question.”\n\nWhat’s new in this statement: Trump Jr. did meet with another person linked to Russia.",
  "That’s all I know about the subject.”\n\nFriday, July 14\n\nNBC News reports that there was another person in the meeting with Trump Jr., Manafort, Kushner, Goldstone and the Russian attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya.",
  "I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.”\n\nAll of this was apparently true — it just left out a lot, as we later learned.",
  "Trump Jr.’s comment:\n\n“I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.",
  "“I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office.",
  "And, yes, I knew Bruiser, the bouncer at the Bellagio, but there was nothing fake about when he punched me in the eye.”\n\nTuesday evening\n\nTrump Jr. appears on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show.",
  "My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events.”\n\nWhat’s new in this statement: Trump Jr. admits that the focus of the meeting was not adoption, but information about Clinton.",
  "Trump Jr.’s comment:\n\n“To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016.",
  "I did so.”\n\nSunday, July 9\n\nThe Times reports that the meeting was predicated not on adoption but on the promise of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.",
  "The Danny Ocean equivalent:\n\n“Just to lay it all out there: Along with a small group of known criminals, I did help build a replica of the vault at the Bellagio.",
  "… I was basically sitting there listening as a courtesy to my acquaintance who had set up the meeting and, in his own words, you can hear what he said about it.",
  "Those emails are from Rob Goldstone, publicist for a Russian musician named Emin Agalarov, with whom Trump has worked on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.",
  "Don Jr.’s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew.",
  "Trump’s response to the Russian offer: “If it’s what you say I love it.”\n\nThe emails also hint at a possible phone call between Trump Jr. and Agalarov.",
  "It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.",
  "The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the 2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow.",
  "I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet.",
  "The Danny Ocean equivalent:\n\n“I did see my friend Rusty Ryan while I was in Las Vegas, as well as some other old acquaintances of mine.",
  "If we do, we will work with any committee or office to convey what he knows.”\n\nWhat’s new in this statement: The emails are confirmed.",
  "And I was actually agitated by it.’”\n\nWhat’s new in this statement: Trump Jr. says he wanted to have a phone call, but didn’t.",
  "Saturday, July 8\n\nThe New York Times reports that Trump Jr. met with a Russian attorney with apparent ties to the Kremlin.",
  "They were at the casino at the same time that I was and, I believe, misrepresented their identities to casino employees.",

  "And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.",
  "His ex-wife knew nothing about it.”\n\nTuesday, July 11\n\nTrump Jr. releases copies of the email to preempt a Times story.",
  "\n\nDonald Trump Jr. watches his father leave the stage on the night of the Iowa caucuses in Des Moines, Feb. 1, 2016.",
  "Also in the meeting were Paul Manafort (the campaign chairman) and Jared Kushner (President Trump’s son-in-law).",
  "She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act.",
  "This model was used to film a few brief videos and for The Amazing Yen to practice some acrobatic techniques.",
  "As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was ‘the most inane nonsense l ever heard.",
  "The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research.",
  "I responded accordingly, and I think if there was something interesting there, I think it’s pretty common.",
  "That person was Rinat Akhmetshin, a lobbyist and possible intelligence agent in the former Soviet Union.",
  "I have been representing people in investigatory matters for almost 30 years, and I see nothing here.",

  "Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.",
  "The Danny Ocean equivalent:\n\n“If the power goes out in a city, how is that my fault?",
  "To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.",
  "… As I recall, it was all basically this email coordination [and not a phone call].",
  "That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind.",
  "He apologized to me walking out of the meeting basically for wasting my time.",
  "The lawyer now says that Goldstone was not the person with the information.",
  "I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance.",
