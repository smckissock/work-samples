  "racked by crises and too preoccupied to care about Ukraine is chipping away at this plurality,\" the group remarks, \"as seen by the growing popularity of the 'Eurorealism' trope (as in, 'Let's be realistic, our prospects are not good').\"",

  "When the revolt against Yanukovych erupted, Ischenko says, some activists went to Kyiv while others congregated on Odessa's Primorsky Boulevard, near the monument to Duke Emmanuel Armand de Richelieu, one of the city's founders.",
  "ECFR notes, however, that if Ukraine wants to get into the good graces of the E.U., the country \"will need to get serious about tackling corruption and advertise some big reform success stories in the coming year.\"",
  "ECFR adds, \"This may not be the top item on Trump's agenda, but European public opinion cares more about whether Ukraine is worth saving; and Kyiv needs to do much more to make a convincing case in this respect.\"",
  "Foremost in the minds of many revolutionaries who sought to topple the unpopular government of Viktor Yanukovych was the overarching need to bring Ukraine into line with supposedly western standards of modernity.",
  "Kyiv has also undertaken measures to ensure greater transparency in media, and not surprisingly reforms have revealed that media ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few fabulously wealthy oligarchs.",
