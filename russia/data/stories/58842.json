  "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST: Well, if the memo measures up to the adjectives of these Republican House members are making, it's shocking, it's a bombshell, it suggests that the entire investigation was bogus from the start, that apparently this fake dossier that the Democrats paid for, they took that to the FISA court and the FISA court executed warrants which then allowed them to survey members of the Trump campaign.",
  "JARRETT: Oh, he already does, because he's looking at theft of government documents and potentially leaking and conveying to himself classified information, as well as obstruction of justice if for political reasons and it appears that this is the case, the FBI and Comey and others cleared Hillary Clinton, notwithstanding --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Why wouldn't that be on destruction of justice?",
  "And when the American people see how this began, when the American people see how different people interacted with one another, how organizations were infected and infiltrated and subjected to tremendous biased of individuals and how that really played out, I think that every American will understand how absolutely ludicrous it is that we continue to allow the Mueller probe to go forward.",
  "Why don't they want the American people to know the truth about what was going on with the government, how that impacted the president, his transition, his campaign and it just seems interesting to me that Democrats don't want us to know what the entire basis was in the first place for the Mueller probe.",
  "But as Matt Gaetz said, and Sara say, this is something that needs to be out -- so this should never happen in a country as great as the United States of America and we need every single American, take a look at this and see what exactly their government did, their law enforcement division did.",
  "HANNITY: In this case, we've got literally the powerful tools of intelligence, weaponized and FISA warrants weaponized against one candidate, an opposition candidate with lies from the other candidate that she paid for and then it goes further -- to get the warrant and then beyond that.",
  "LAHREN: I think when young people are going out and getting first jobs if they do move out of their parent's basement and actually want to get a job, they will be happy when they can keep more of what they earn instead of seconding it to Washington, D.C. To their favorite politician.",
  "Now we know from what we have been hearing from the sources, from the congressional members who have seen this memo that the collusion appears to be between certain members of the FBI and the DOJ and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and that the foundation of this was all based on lies.",
  "REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: Yes, you are describing the very elements of a palace coup, and after Jim and Mark Meadows and many others of us reviews intelligence information today, it is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a foundation of corruption.",
  "The FBI and the Department of Justice trying to do something so under handed, illegal and nefarious and abusing their power to try to alter the election and then there after continue on with fictitious collusion investigation into Donald Trump to try to remove him from office.",
  "It is absolutely essential that we understand what was happening and this was a duly elected president of the United States of America, and if people within our own government were trying to usurp that and change the trajectory, then the American people need to know.",
  "And I will tell you this, because I have been going out -- have you been sending me out to west Hollywood and other areas in California which we think would be so liberal what I'm really finding out Sean is there are some people that support this President.",
  "Now, at the end of all of this, we're going to learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel, Robert Mueller and his band of Democratic witch-hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately.",
  "What we're talking about tonight is the systematic abuse of power, the weaponizing of those powerful tools of intelligence, and the shredding of our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights that protect all of us against unlawful search and seizure.",
  "That is why majority leader Mitch McConnell just said a few moments ago, this should be an easy vote for both sides to support the house version that basically keeps the government only for about a month while they negotiate on a bigger deal.",

  "She said it would bring, quote, Armageddon and as you heard the President note a moment ago there just the opposite is happening with companies like Apple stepping up with major investment in jobs and wages after that tax cut passed, Sean.",
  "The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine and that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people.",
  "You know, Sean, when you been on this show each and every night making claims about the bias and the corruption and the deep state, people have accused you and your guests of being tin foil hat folks, lone voices in the wilderness.",
  "But the tax cuts are the most significant tax cut, most significant reform in American history with tremendous tax relief for working families, for small businesses, for big businesses that produce jobs, for just about everybody.",
  "So, all the lefts, I would want you to put on your thinking caps and imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, what would you be seeing if these were about President Obama, given evidence this flimsy, this lame, this weak.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Meanwhile tonight Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein is trying to pin the blame for potential shut down on Republicans flat out charging in her words people will die if the government shuts down.",
  "Not only do I want to know what Rosenstein who was actually the Department of Justice was withholding that information for a long period of time, you know, and then finally gave it up to the House Intelligence Committee.",
  "GAETZ: Well, Sean, we can't get into the specific information, but I can tell you I am as certain as ever that the claims we have been making are accurate claims that there is intelligence information that backs it up.",
  "What we're talking about tonight is an abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we use to spy on people, except those tools were used against an opposition candidate, and a president-elect, and his entire team.",
  "HANNITY: So the President comes out with this fake news media award last night, but then you are watching the media and they are trashing his doctor, the guy that is also a doctor for Barack Obama and George W. Bush.",
  "You know what we really should do in the spirit of caring and the spirit of sharing we should have that same doctor examine folks like Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, because they need all the help they can get.",
  "And tonight, we can confirm that the Trump-hating, Clinton-loving, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, they are at the nexus of everything and there is so much more information coming.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: All right the video of the day took place on the Columbia River in Oregon where a GO-Pro camera captured a dramatic potentially deadly scene, you have to see this to believe it.",
  "Remember Strzok, he wrote his mistress, Page, \"I want to believe the path that you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there is no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk.",
  "And now, it is transparent to all of us what Strzok was saying to page when they spoke about the insurance policy with Andy -- we believe Andrew McCabe in that text message, needing that insurance policy.",
  "I opened up that folder and I looked down the Justice Department official slid that folder over to me on the table and look down and see they gave Cheryl Mills immunity during the Clinton investigation?",
  "Now, we need to know what all of these top Obama administration officials knew and when they found out, and exactly how they were involved in spying on an opposition campaign and an incoming president.",
  "It sounds like they are fixing and rigging here a general election or to overturn an election, and, you know, I mean, whatever word you want to describe that -- fixing, rigging, a coup, I don't know.",
  "That allowed Clinton to stay in the race and at the same time, Strzok his mistress, Lisa Page, deputy FBI Director McCabe seemed to be on a mission, an insurance policy mission to destroy Trump.",
  "Because it sounds like a few people decided they wanted to fix not only -- they fixed it not only so Hillary would get in trouble on the email server scandal, we know felonies were committed.",
  "Around the exact same time that Strzok and Page are talking about their insurance policy, well, the Obama administration officials are going to the FISA court to get a warrant on Carter Page.",
  "That's why we are calling on every bit of that information we got to see today to be made public for you to see, for journalists to the see, most importantly for the American people to see.",
  "I compared it to -- I remember the day I walked in two years ago on the Benghazi committee walked in and saw the immunity agreements that were given to people in the Clinton investigation.",
  "Applications for unemployment, are at 45 year low, black unemployment the lowest ever reported, female unemployment the lowest in 17 years, Hispanic unemployment the lowest ever recorded.",
  "Feinstein earlier tonight told CNN quote people die, accidents happen, because it will be hard to predict what impact there will be when, quote, necessary functions cease.",
  "But after you read it and you see, and if they're playing partisan politics, you can see why they didn't want us to see that and why though won't want the American people.",
  "Can you imagine if Obama had spent 10 months investigating collusion which nobody can define, which apparently people like Trey Gowdy has not yet been able to define yet?",
  "Here with legal reaction to tonight's breaking news of this rampant, apparent FISA surveillance abuse and the targeting of then candidate and then President-elect Trump.",
  "My opinion, all the noise we hear won't matter when people are back to work out of poverty, off of food stamps and the country now prospering and we are safe and secure.",
  "They want to drag this out through the midterm elections to try to embarrass this president and distract from the critical work we have to do to save this great country.",
  "HANNITY: I know from my sources, Sara, that they are saying this should result in the immediate firing of Lisa Page, of Peter Strzok, of Bruce Ohr, also Andrew McCabe.",
  "Americans do anything, build anything, and create anything as long as we have pride in our country, confidence in our values, and respect for our great American flag.",
  "Demanding that codifying DACA, basically giving legal status to the children of illegal immigrants be included or else they will vote no to keep the government open.",
  "I think we should share the doctor's expertise with those individuals, because in the spirit of mental health awareness they need far more help than this President.",
  "HANNITY: -- and then a cover-up and the burglary was designed to try to get information on opposing presidential candidate so can you help win the election, right?",
  "More importantly when I sat through the security briefing, 642,000 Texans were victims of crimes by illegal immigrants in the seven and a half year period of time.",
  "This critical intelligence information will vindicate the claims that have been made by so many and it is absolutely essential that we share it with all Americans.",
  "Now, Fusion GPS, they never even verified what was in that dossier, never tried, because they trusted Christopher Steele who they hired, who put it all together.",
  "TARLOV: You know Republicans get --\n\nHANNITY: Hang on, and all those people who get their free vacation we will end up paying them back pay, like we always do.",
  "But I would like to know how Sidney Blumenthal plays into all of this because I think that's going to be a very telling revelation when all of this comes out.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Here with reaction is the co-host of \"The Five\" and the host of \"Watters World,\" it's his world we live in it, how do you do it.",
  "Thank goodness for what Devin Nunes and his committee are doing and the push they did on the Justice Department to get these documents in the first place.",
  "Then Peter Strzok and James Comey -- well, they fixed the investigation into her emails by exonerating her before even investigating that particular case.",
  "The house just voted moments ago to keep the government open with the provision that extends a popular children's health insurance program for six years.",
  "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I can certainly say that my reporting coincides with what Congressman Gaetz and Congressman Jordan are saying.",
  "Some of the very people we have been talking about will be exposed and the key reason that all Americans need to see this memo is that it names names.",
  "The media, the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, the whole lot of them going crazy, because this President is winning just like he told us he was going to do.",
  "HANNITY: Is it a fair statement that we've been -- the onion we have been unpeeling, we have been over the target the whole time, Congressman Gaetz?",
  "And you and I would not be having this conversation and Trump would not have been spending 10 months of his administration fending this stuff off.",
  "Out on the road charging that Democrats want the government to shut down in order to divert attention from an economy that he says is taking off.",
  "HANNITY: Also today in Pennsylvania the President reminded the country that his position on securing the southern border was not changed one bit.",
  "But, remember, Republicans have a majority in both the house and senate so they have a responsibility to try and get this through both chambers.",
  "And it was all done by just a few people who think and thought they knew better than you about who should be the president of the United States.",
  "CARTER: Well, apparently, when this document goes public, which I believe it will, I do believe it will be the unraveling of the Mueller probe.",
  "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: A lot of people are in legal jeopardy right now for their jobs, for crimes that may have been committed.",
  "Classified DOJ documents that members of Congress are now reviewing it shows widespread and extensive FISA abuses against the Trump campaign.",
  "REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Sean, what I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was.",
  "TARLOV: Why are their Texas GOP representatives that say that they don't want the border wall and it's not the most effective way to do it?",
  "Democrats have been consistent on this Hillary and Dianne Feinstein all spoken out for border security it's part of the gang of eight bill.",
  "HANNITY: Do you have -- can you give us any information, not giving us any details, Congressman Jordan but -- about Comey, about Mueller?",
  "HANNITY: Children in their 20's and 30's but also they want chain migration to continue and they want their families to be able to come.",
  "And it also became clear to me why Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham felt it so important to refer this matter for criminal prosecution.",
  "HANNITY: Without giving any details, do you conclude that Mueller, the whole issue of Trump-Russia collusion never should have come up.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(SCREAMING)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Unbelievable, thank god nobody was seriously injured during that collision.",
  "TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, because the Democrats and liberal mainstream media, they're shaking in their boots right now.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: America is back and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.",

  "If the majority of the committee votes to release these documents, the executive branch gets a certain amount of time to review them.",
  "HANNITY: So, the most important thing tonight more than anything is let's get this in the hands of the American people, Larry Elder.",
  "What we read today though was a memo that compiled information that they got that they presented to members of Congress to look at.",
  "More interesting is that these dire prediction of people dying was actually made already by Nancy Pelosi before the tax cut votes.",
  "Every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information.",
  "At that point the Obama administration, they should have known that the dossier was totally false, full of salacious Russian lies.",
  "Now, sources are telling us tonight that the first time they tried to get the FISA warrant against Carter Page was in the summer.",
  "Now, as we have talked throughout the week, even a quote, unquote, shut down of the government does not mean a complete shutdown.",
  "JARRETT: And it was probably used in advance of the election so it would be leaked and harm Donald Trump so that he wouldn't win.",
  "And it's clear they were using the powerful tools of intelligence and a FISA warrant to have a backup plan in case Hillary lost.",
  "And it's also reform, but I usually just say tax cuts because that is what people -- they don't want to hear about the reform.",
  "Now, you can forget about the reporting about George Papadopoulos running his mouth at a nightclub to an Australian diplomat.",
  "Did he -- because we now know the dossier, the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier, that was used for the FISA warrant.",

  "TARLOV: Majority of Americans, Republican and Democrats, independence as well don't see these dreamers as illegal aliens.",
  "At the last minute at the House, they finally got literally within an hour, their subpoena requests approved by the DOJ.",
  "These are people --\n\nHANNITY: Then you have the surveillance of an opposition party candidate and then president-elect.",
  "We look to top officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI to not only uphold the law, but to ensure democracy.",
  "And, listen, when they are sending the text messages about an insurance policy, they are also going to the FISA court.",
  "Then the second time they tried to get it in the early fall, they used the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier.",
  "HANNITY: This is an island show right now, but I've got to believe that the media can't ignore this for much longer.",
  "It's an attempt to completely underline electoral democracy and simultaneously obstruct justice, subverting justice.",
  "TARLOV: As General Kelly said last night with Bret Baier, when President Trump made that promise, he was uninformed.",
  "And as you know, in fact in an interview with you, I said the wall, you don't need a wall where you have a mountain.",
  "WATTERS: So people aren't crossing right now, because the border patrol catches a thousand people crossing each day.",

  "TARLOV: Don't call him that and I don't like this turban Durbin or Dickey Durbin or whatever people are saying.",

  "Today, we are calling on all Americans to be able to see this material so they can see what really took place.",
  "This dossier was designed to manipulate, lie to and use Russian lies paid for by Hillary to rig that election.",
  "At the end of the day come up to mid- terms and re-election time that is what's going to matter is the result.",
  "After did you go read this material --\n\nHANNITY: Well, we can eliminate this quickly it wasn't Jeff Sessions.",
  "So, tonight, sources who were familiar with this classified information, only Congress can see it right now.",
  "And, by the way, the meaning by behind this particular text message is now tonight coming into clear focus.",
  "HANNITY: This now put -- you know, I couldn't understand for the longest time, I know the media is corrupt.",
  "HANNITY: And then you have this whole other group of people that want an insurance policy in case he wins.",
  "What were these really egregious actions that took place that only this memorandum and report can tell us?",
  "HANNITY: Well, it sounds to me like a lot of people, Congressman Gaetz, need to be fired and investigated.",

  "But, first, based on today's events, I have a message tonight for the special counsel Robert Mueller.",
  "And from what I have been told, senior government officials may be removed from office, may be fired.",
  "Any lawyer is going to tell you that that four-way hearsay, that's never going to hold up in court.",

  "And everything that we have learned so far about Strzok and Page is now beginning to make sense.",
  "We know they paid Fusion GPS, what, 12 billion plus dollars to put this phony dossier together.",
  "This is an abuse of surveillance and intelligence to win an election, a massive abuse of power.",
  "It's not smart politics and hard men and working people of this country aren't going to buy it.",
  "We have numbers to prove it that was the President's speech from earlier today in Pennsylvania.",
  "I think they will start to see it and this President will make a whole lot more sense to them.",
  "WATTERS: Jessica, the point is walls work you don't want it, because you guys need new voters.",
  "ELDER: And, Sean, I think it's instructive that the vote to release this was down party lines.",
  "So, it's either Rosenstein or I believe one other person has the ability to --\n\nJORDAN: Right.",
