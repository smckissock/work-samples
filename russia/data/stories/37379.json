  "“I moved down to Miami fairly early, but more developers are now making the move to South Florida because of the amount of opportunities available there.”\n\nProperty Markets Group, a developer with JDS Development Group of the Walker Tower, which broke a record for downtown Manhattan when it sold a penthouse this year for more than $50 million, was also an early champion of Miami real estate.",
  "It was just too good an opportunity to pass up.”\n\nPrices at the Ritz-Carlton range from $2 million to $40 million, or roughly $1,300 to $1,400 a square foot on average, said Ophir Sternberg, a founding partner of Lionheart Capital, the property’s developer.",
  "“It is very different than what my prior perception of it was going back 10 or 15 years.”\n\nEvan Speiser, a 30-year-old vice president at the Speiser Organization, agreed.",
  "Mr. Speiser, whose firm is a family-run business that specializes in real estate development, acquisition and management, currently rents a loft on the Lower East Side.",
  "Despite the price tag and its location, the penthouse already has a full-price offer from a South American buyer, although no contract has been signed.",
  "“About 20 percent of our buyers are domestic, and of those, at least 90 percent are from New York,” said Kevin Maloney, the company’s chief executive.",
  "Like many companies, Mr. Sternberg’s firm was based in New York City for 16 years before he moved its operations to Miami some four years ago.",
  "“They say, ‘Let’s move to Miami because it is less expensive,’ but as New Yorkers come down and buy, the prices have been going up.”",
  "If sold at that price, it would be a record for the downtown Miami neighborhood, which is on Biscayne Bay and not on the ocean.",
  "The company has been aggressively pricing its Miami projects and is offering a free Tesla Model S to its penthouse buyers.",
  "Rather than buy in New York, he decided to purchase a four-bedroom apartment at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach.",
  "It has several projects underway, including Echo Brickell, also with JDS Development, and Muse Sunny Isles.",
  "“The Miami market is in the middle of popping, rather than New York, where it has popped already.",
  "Its latest listing is a 10,500-foot penthouse at Echo Brickell for $37 million.",
  "Miami has also become a mecca for foodies and a darling of the art crowd.",
  "“I thought there was a lot more upside in Miami than New York,” he said."
