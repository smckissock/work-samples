  "On Feb. 26, Manafort sent the person a series of messages through an encrypted application, including a link to a Business Insider story with the headline: \"Former European leaders struggle to explain themselves after Mueller claims Paul Manafort paid them to lobby for Ukraine.\"",
  "In the latest court documents, prosecutors say that while he was under house arrest, Manafort and his associate attempted to get two witnesses to lie about the nature of lobbying and public relations work they carried out at Manafort's direction on behalf of Ukraine.",
  "Prosecutors say Manafort directed the group's work and secretly funneled more than $2 million to it to take positions favorable to Ukraine including by lobbying in the U.S. without disclosing that they were being paid to favorably represent the country.",
  "WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort made several attempts to tamper with witnesses in his ongoing criminal case, prosecutors said Monday as they asked a federal judge to consider jailing him while he awaits trial.",
  "But prosecutors say they were principals in a public relations firm that worked with Manafort in organizing a group of former European officials, known as the Hapsburg group, who promoted Ukrainian interests in Europe as well as the U.S.",
  "The allegations of attempted witness tampering relate to Manafort's criminal case in Washington where he faces charges of money-laundering conspiracy, false statements and acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests.",
  "According to the court filing, Manafort began messaging and calling one of the witnesses in February shortly the unsealing of the indictment that included the allegations of unregistered lobbying related to the Hapsburg group.",
  "In a court filing , prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller wrote that Manafort and one of his associates \"repeatedly\" contacted two witnesses in an effort to influence their testimony.",
  "The day after Gates' plea, Manafort messaged and called one of the witnesses and continued reaching out over the next several days, according to a sworn affidavit filed by an FBI agent in the case.",
  "Kilimnik, who has denied having connections to Russian intelligence agencies, was also involved in the ghostwritten op-ed matter, which prosecutors also connect to Person A in the latest filing.",
  "The charges — they involve tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts — do not relate to his work on the Trump campaign or involve allegations of Russian election interference.",
  "The group's work factors into an indictment against Manafort that accuses him of acting as an unregistered foreign agent by lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of Ukrainian interests.",
  "Late last year, federal agents discovered that Manafort was attempting to ghostwrite an opinion piece in Ukraine even though he was under a gag order in the case.",
  "The court documents do not name Manafort's associate, but they refer to him as \"Person A\" and note the pseudonym is consistent with previous filings in the case.",
  "In earlier filings, Person A has referred to Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort associate who prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence.",
  "The contacts occurred earlier this year, shortly after a grand jury returned a new indictment against Manafort and while he was confined to his home.",
  "Around that same time, Manafort's co-defendant and longtime business associate, Rick Gates, pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.",
  "The individual immediately ended the call \"because he was concerned about the outreach,\" according to the affidavit.",
  "Reached Monday evening, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said his client and his attorneys were reviewing the filing.",
  "The filing marks the second time that Mueller's team has accused Manafort of violating a judge's order in the case.",
  "In one call, the agent wrote, Manafort said he wanted to give the witness a \"heads-up about Hapsburg.\"",
  "Several members of the Hapsburg group have previously denied the allegations.",
  "He also faces bank fraud and tax evasion charges in Virginia.",
  "Manafort has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.",
  "The two witnesses were also not named in court filings.",
  "I have made clear that they worked in Europe.\"",
  "Another message said, \"We should talk."
