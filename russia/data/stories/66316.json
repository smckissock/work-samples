  "Kevin Downing, Manafort's main defense lawyer, argued to US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, DC that Rosenstein's order appointing Mueller, which authorizes him to investigate Russia's interference in the election and \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,\" does not cover Manafort's consulting work in Ukraine.",
  "Yanukovych, a strongman and a prominent figure in the Party of Regions, was ousted from the presidency in 2014 amid widespread protests against his Russia-friendly positions and his decision to back out of a deal that would have promoted closer ties between Ukraine and the West, and distanced it from Russia.",
  "Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nMueller's office said in an April 2 court filing that any investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia \"would naturally cover ties that a former Trump campaign manager had to Russian-associated political operatives, Russian-backed politicians, and Russian oligarchs.\"",

  "Michael Dreeben, a seasoned prosecutor working on Mueller's team, pushed back and said they were justified in probing Manafort because of his status as Trump's campaign chairman and his \"long-standing ties to Russia-backed politicians.\"",
  "Last year, The Washington Post reported that Manafort emailed the former Russian military intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik, beginning in April 2016, offering to give Deripaska \"private briefings\" about the Trump campaign.",
