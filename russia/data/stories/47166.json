  "Central parts of the law for individuals include a requirement that sites such as Facebook explain what data they are collecting in clear, non-lawyer terms, the right to erase one's data and \"purpose limitation\" that restricts data from being used for anything other than what it was originally collected for, such as location data on Google Maps being used only to help someone get from A to B."
