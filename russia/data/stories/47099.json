  "Sniping between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook was one of the sideshows of Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony earlier this month about the Cambridge Analytica data scandals: Cook said publicly that Facebook’s entire business model is based on a “violation of privacy,” prompting Zuckerberg to respond that at least Facebook doesn’t make its money catering to “rich people” — a not-so-subtle shot at Apple products like the $1,000-plus iPhone X.",
  "\"It’s an effort by the broader technology community to avoid guilt by association with the Facebook business model, which is somewhat unique to Facebook, and often inconsistent with the values of the broader technology ecosystem,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a longtime Republican lobbyist who held a top technology policy post in George W.

  "Lawmakers from both parties raised the specter of regulation during the two days of hearings with Zuckerberg, an indication that the tech-bashing rhetoric of the past year could lead to more government oversight of the internet.",
  "While the industry may broadly share liberal-leaning stances on issues like immigration reform and climate change, its varying business models mean that companies' competitive and regulatory interests are not always so aligned.",
  "But no House members or senators asked him about Cook’s remarks, and instead Zuckerberg used the hearings to express contrition for the leaking of data on 87 million Facebook users to the Trump-linked firm Cambridge Analytica.",

  "\"You have near-term concern about brands and people managing them in different ways,\" the industry lobbyist said, \"but should the industry stay unified or not is the question.\"",
