  "\"My assumption throughout the last 26 years I've been going there has always been that any Russian person might share information with the Russian government ... as I have similarly done with the CIA, the FBI and other government agencies in the past.\"",
  "As CNN first reported, Carter Page's speech critical of US policy against Russia in July 2016 at a prominent Moscow university drew the attention of the FBI and raised concerns he had been compromised by Russian intelligence, according to US officials.",
  "\"For your information, I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Cafe, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year.\"",
  "\"Physically and technically, frankly speaking, I don't think he had any time for that, he was with the school pretty much during most of the day, both days, and the remaining half of the day that he was in Moscow,\" Klimentov said.",

  "Page is one of several Trump advisers US and European intelligence found to be in contact with Russian officials and other Russians known to Western intelligence during the campaign, according to multiple US officials.",
  "How Page's name became associated with the campaign is a reflection of how minimal the Trump operation was last year, as establishment national security figures avoided an association with the insurgent operation.",
  "Part of the problem for investigators has been that they lost their opportunity to conduct the investigation in secret after several leaks last year revealed FBI was looking at people close to the Trump campaign.",
  "But a former Obama administration official briefed on Russia's meddling in the election says Russians who work at prominent think tanks, universities and businesses often play an informal intelligence role.",

  "On the sidelines of a convention-related event, Page and other Trump advisers, including JD Gordon and Jeff Sessions, met with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.",
  "\"It was partially supported by the fact that The Washington Post, the newspaper, back in the spring of 2016, cited Carter as one of Mr. Trump's foreign policy advisors.\"",
  "As Trump prepared to meet with The Washington Post editorial page in March 2016, the campaign was under pressure to name national security advisers.",
  "\"It's quite possible that Trump's advisor is a pragmatist and a realist,\" Reshetnikov said, according to a translation of his comments in Russian.",

  "They also feared that Russian operatives maintained contact with him both in the United States and Russia, US officials say.",
  "Page disputes the idea he has ever collected intelligence for the Russians, saying he helped the US intelligence community.",
  "The official also says the places he listed as visiting are public spaces visited by millions of people a year.",
  "The intelligence led to an investigation into the coordination of Trump's campaign associates and the Russians.",
