[
  "(CNN) President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen filed for a restraining order late Thursday against Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, to prevent him from speaking to the press about the adult film star's lawsuit.",
  "Avenatti's \"publicity tour,\" the filing said, is \"likely to result in Mr. Cohen being deprived of his right to a fair trial, and threatens to turn what should be a solemn federal court proceeding into a media circus.\"",
  "Daniels is suing the two men, as well as Essential Consultants, Cohen's shell company, to try to nullify the 2016 hush agreement that sought to prevent her from speaking out about her alleged affair with Trump.",
  "Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 days before the 2016 election, as part of a hush agreement to prevent the porn star from publicly discussing her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
  "\"Avenatti's actions are mainly driven by his seemingly unquenchable thirst for publicity,\" the filing said, alleging that Avenatti \"routinely denigrates\" Cohen.",
  "In recent weeks, Trump also acknowledged that he personally reimbursed Cohen for that payment.",
  "Avenatti is representing her in the case.",
