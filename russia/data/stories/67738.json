  "But meeting with somebody who was offered and advertised as an agent of the Russian government, wouldn't that have been something that if you were advising the campaign, you would say, \"Russia is an enemy of the United States.",
  "CBS News\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What would be the best thing as far as the for the president's- As the president's lawyer, what would be the best thing that his son could do in terms of answering questions about this meeting?",
  "And then he went on and explained what happened at the meeting, discussed the - the nature of the meeting, that it was not based on- it was supposed to be about opposition research and ended up not being on that.",
  "President Trump's troubles grew last week with the release of emails showing Donald Trump Jr. arranging a meeting with a Russian lawyer in 2016 in hopes of collecting damaging information about Hillary Clinton.",
  "The individual -the individuals that were involved in the meeting ended up going right down to Washington to still lobby on the Magnitsky Act and that whole issue of Russian sanctions.",
  "So when you say, \"Other meetings that took place,\" I'm sure they had conversations during the course of a campaign about meetings that were relevant to some kind of determination.",
  "But on - on this question of what, what people were thinking about the Russians in the summer of 2016, I mean, you wrote a book called The Unholy Alliance about the Russians.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Would it- And so would it help the president's case if he testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee and others who's asked for him to testify?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, look I think- I think Don Jr., you know, addressed that, saying if he was looking at it, he would look at it differently now or handle it differently.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Do you- The AP is reporting that the lobbyist who was in the meeting said that the president's son was given a portfolio of information.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Is it possible as the president's lawyer to say the president knows of no other meetings with his campaign staff and Russians?",
  "Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump's legal team and chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, joined \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.",
  "He said he has- had no meetings, was aware of no meetings with Russians, was not aware of this one until really right before it all broke.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: And nothing from any of the Senate investigative committees that would suggest the president is under investigation?",
  "You had the situation with the Ukrainians doing the same thing with the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.",
  "Are you confident that the president knows everything about all the meetings his son may or may not have had with any Russians?",
  "And he also said he didn't know-- the individual that was there, the Russian American said he-- I read that same AP report.",
  "This is a - the previous nominee of the Republican Party said the Russians were America's number one geopolitical foe.",
  "What follows is a transcript of the interview with Sekulow, which aired Sunday, July 16, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\"",
  "As far as other meetings go, look, the president has said that he was not aware of it, wasn't involved in it.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Yeah the president told me- I'm not going- Obviously the president has been very clear on that.",
  "Back in June of 2016, leaving aside, there was no question of collusion at that time in the public record.",
  "Nothing's changed since James Comey said three times to the president that he was under investigation.",
  "The president's engagement on this was that he was not aware and did not participate in any of this.",
  "So it may well could - So if there was anything, it could have been about the Magnitsky Act.",
  "I'm not going to get into particulars of what that testimony would - would be involved.",
  "And he's addressed it publicly, about his concerns with Russian engagement generally.",
  "That's a conversation that would take place between Donald Trump Jr. and his lawyer.",
  "The president was not aware about this meeting, did not participate in this meeting.",
  "He discussed Trump Jr.'s meeting, and whether or not the president was aware of it.",
  "So shouldn't that have raised red flags just from a national security standpoint?",
  "As somebody who knows something about national security, you've written about it.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. answered questions and said he would continue to if needed to.",
  "And the president was not made aware of this nor participated in this meeting.",
  "So, again, it was kind of- the meeting was under a false pretense in a sense.",
  "If he had to do it all over again, there are things he would do differently.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: But he--\n\nJAY SEKULOW: So I want to be really clear on that.",
  "But, again, in the heat of the campaign, it's easy to be-- I'm the lawyer.",
  "Look, he released all of the emails, including the entire chain of emails.",
  "Mr. Sekulow, I want to start with this meeting with the president's son.",
  "And he's also chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice.",
  "When we last talked, you said the president is not under investigation.",
  "The president went to Vladimir Putin at the G-20 and talked about this.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, we've had no notification from the special counsel.",
  "Joining us now is Jay Sekulow, who is on the president's legal team.",
  "Not every- Most meetings were never discussed with the president.",
  "I don't know what information was allegedly left, if - if any.",
  "I mean, opposition research in campaigns happens all the time.",
  "When - Donald Trump Jr. did it when he went on Sean Hannity.",
  "And in fact there's been no information to the contrary.",
  "And he said he doesn't know if there was anything in it.",
  "And so it's not like this is the same as the Ukrainians.",
  "And I don't like to look at hindsight on how you do it.",
  "Donald Trump Jr. himself said he would do the meeting.",
  "But, again, the conversation was on the Magnitsky Act.",
  "But I have no knowledge of what that would have been.",
  "So, again, I don't look at any of this in a vacuum.",
  "It's not as if the president's not addressing this.",
  "So I understand exactly the question you're asking.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\"",
  "But the discussion was about the Magnitsky Act.",
  "And I appreciate you letting me just say that.",
  "Jay Sekulow, thanks so much for being with us.",
  "I mean, that's - that's normally how these go.",
  "We've had nothing to the contrary since then.",
  "And I don't even know if anything was left.",
  "The president said he didn't know about it.",
  "And there's been no indication otherwise.",
  "He said he's willing to talk about it.",
  "I'm, I'm - I wasn't their lawyer then.",
  "And how do you know it to be the case?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, I think he did it.",
  "And that's what the president said.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well that, well, look.",
  "It was in the middle of a campaign.",
  "And he asked Putin about it twice.",
  "And, again, I'm not their lawyer.",
  "So the president was campaigning.",
  "I didn't represent the campaign.",
  "Do you know anything about that?",
  "So he's been very clear on that.",
  "Nothing to the president at all.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you.",
  "Vladimir Putin is on the cover.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, I know this.",
  "His staff was having meetings.",
  "I was not the campaign lawyer.",
  "And I think he was very clear.",
  "So that's how you look at it.",
  "I deal with the legal issues.",
  "He was helping the campaign.",
  "I'm not the campaign lawyer.",
  "You look at it at the time.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: Absolutely.",
  "I need to be clear on this.",
  "I represent the president.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON: All right.",
  "Don't take this meeting\"?",
  "JAY SEKULOW: No, I don't.",
  "He's willing to testify.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Well, look.",
  "Is that still your case?",
  "And we'll be right back.",
  "JAY SEKULOW: Correct.",
  "But this one was not.",
  "I'm not his lawyer.",
  "So that was a lot.",
  "He's not a lawyer.",
  "Thanks.",
  "Look."
