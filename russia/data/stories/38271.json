  "Further, if Caldbeck’s behavior at Lightspeed had been made public, instead of him raising his own fund and harassing more women, he might have had to retreat for awhile, say, in a low profile job, doing boring work, making far less money, going to counseling, and in the best case, rehabbing his image, learning, becoming a better person, and if he’s lucky, raising a fund later.",
  "When applied to reference checking, the essence of it is that if you withhold material evidence of unacceptable behavior when giving a reference (such as a history of workplace violence, or sexual harassment), and the person repeats that behavior at the new workplace, you may be sued either by the new employer or by the damaged individual, or both.",
  "On Lightspeed’s role in this:\n\nFrank writes: While the libel/defamation laws today really prevent you from saying almost anything bad about a former employee (unless they are convicted of a crime), a simple “no comment”, sends a strong message to any would-be limited partner.",
  "Today we’re starting with reader comments on the past few weeks of news about sexual harassment in Silicon Valley…\n\nOn sexual harassment in venture capital:\n\nA writes: Have you noticed how many women came out to accuse names NOT mentioned in the press?",
  "But I don’t think they should not be allowed to get jobs where they are in positions of prominence and power in an industry, and able to use that power to sexually harass and get away with it, as a GP at a venture firm is.",
  "If the provider of a reference divulges such information, they likely will prevent that person from getting a job, and may be sued by him or her for doing so (usually for defamation, to which truth is a complete shield).",
  "He calls that CEO (Shane Mac)’s request that a female be put in charge of managing the portfolio “moronic.” Two other portfolio companies have asked for conversations about returning capital, he notes.",
  "On Binary Capital portfolio companies returning capital:\n\nColin clarifies: To return money, generally the company and a majority of the investors (by capital amount) will have to agree.",
  "***\n\nTHE LATEST development at Binary Capital is an unapologetic email from Justin Caldbeck’s partners Jonathan Teo to his portfolio companies and limited partners, obtained by Axios.",
  "These are the first cracks in the sanctimonious system that marginalizes women and people of color and a cascading list of gender, ethnic, age, social, and geographic groups.",
  "(And no, “rot in hell” probably isn’t a viable option for solving the biological problem of having to feed oneself, though I’m not disagreeing with the sentiment!)",
  "What’s likely to happen is some heads will roll, tokens will be offered, and the arrogance will continue under a slightly more diverse, more civilized branding.",
  "Hopefully, with this scandal, the root cause, which is arrogance based on privilege and often undeserved success and power, will finally get some attention.",
  "Not all investors have to accept, but you can force out smaller holdouts by converting to common stock, a squeeze-out merger, and other corporate methods.",
  "Teo also says that only one Binary portfolio company has asked to return capital to the firm (that would be Assist, as previously reported in Term Sheet).",
  "… My job is not to make you all feel good … So forgive me if I have not prioritized pandering to the people that feel entitled to be coddled.",
  "It is not fair that someone like Caldbeck could do what he did at Lightspeed and then get to keep his position in the industry at Binary.",
  "It creates the impression that those guys were the only jerks, that this issue is not symptomatic because it is limited to those guys.",
  "This is a small community, everybody knows somebody and there are other ways to send the message to stop these guys in their tracks.",
  "Occasionally investors will negotiate class-by-class vetoes, requiring a majority of Series Seed, majority of Series A, etc.",
  "I wonder if it’s media’s job to make this issue reach wider: that effort would add momentum to the fix that’s deeply needed.",
  "Is this entire mess fixing anything at all because most women out there stay silent like they were before?",
  "It ends with collapse, like what we saw with Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns on Wall Street 10 years ago.",
  "This is why people giving references often omit such things and hope that the behavior won’t be repeated.",
  "A sample passage from the email to portfolio companies:\n\nFor now, trust that I want to do what’s right.",
  "The real problem is he will just continue this kind of behavior until he is (hopefully) unemployable.",
  "[The men accused of sexual harassment] are very different guys, but what they all share is arrogance.",
  "Jon writes: Lightspeed has some legal vulnerability under the concept of negligent referral.",
  "Many people are qualified to be venture investors but very few are so lucky to become GPs.",
  "Lots of feedback over the last few weeks of newsletters, so this will be a two-parter.",
  "So long as you have that threshold, you can return the capital and redeem the shares.",
  "This is a legal approach which is used relatively rarely, but it’s well-recognized.",
  "Chris writes: Great to see some of the ugly truth about Silicon Valley coming out.",
  "This story, like the organizational implosion at Uber, is hugely consequential.",
  "He notes that Binary’s limited partners have not yet accepted his resignation.",
  "Anything is ok if you think you are so awesome and rules don’t apply to you.",
  "I believe sexual harassment, not just against women by the way, is rampant.",
  "David writes: Don’t apologize for being stuck on the Caldbeck situation.",
  "It’s just that too often it’s the other way around — there’s no justice.",
  "In it, he blames the “corrupted” media for his resignation offer.",
  "From the entrepreneurs to the LPs to the public to the reporters.",
  "I think he should have to change careers or at least industries.",
  "But do we expect these people not to emerge with new jobs later?",
  "Arrogance makes people think harassment and even assault is ok.",
  "Only when they lose their power do people ever learn anything.",
  "Do you have some alternative for what they’re supposed to do?",
  "From my point of view, all of this starts with arrogance.",
  "I don’t think they should never be allowed to get jobs.",
  "I’m not saying there is no redemption for these people.",
  "This is a really tricky problem in reference checking.",
  "But a culture of arrogance doesn’t end with scandal.",
  "So are others who act in a manner similar to him.",
  "It is angry and, in parts, barely coherent.",
  "Parker writes: Caldbeck is clearly a pig.",
  "My response: That’s a great question.",
  "No disagreement with you whatsoever.",
  "I mean, they’ve got to eat, right?",
  "It makes people think fraud is ok.",
  "Don’t apologize; keep reporting.",
  "It is important.",
  "Call me cynical.",
  "But I doubt it.",
  "Good morning.",
  "?",
