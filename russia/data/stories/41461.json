  "In an interview with The Washington Post Thursday , the President's attorney Rudy Giuliani alluded to the sticking point with the questions, saying, \"There are some that create more issues for us legally than others.\"",

  "The source would not say if the concerns have been conveyed to Mueller's team.",
