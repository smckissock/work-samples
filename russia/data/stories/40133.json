  "“The only way you’re going to do it is climb.”\n\nIn 2015, though, Washingtonians got another way to look in on the private lives of eagles: the D.C. Eagle Cam, installed above a nest at the National Arboretum by the American Eagle Foundation.",
  "After graduating from George Mason University with a degree in biology, he banded birds in Virginia as a volunteer for the Fish and Wildlife Service and offered his time to falcon recovery at the Peregrine Fund at Cornell University.",
  "Despite their power and strength, eagles possess a capacity for great gentleness, which Koppie has been able to observe as he has lazed around in nests for hours, waiting for teams on the ground to finish work on eaglets.",
  "“They’re holding a fish, and they’re tearing it and getting the tiniest little piece, and this huge beak reaches down with the tiniest pink flesh on the end, to just barely touch this baby’s beak,” he said.",
  "It was a tender, caring family: devoted parents bringing food to their babies, perching together as if enjoying the view, and sibling eaglets having little spats just like any brothers and sisters.",
  "\n\nWildlife biologist Craig Koppie, who helped save the bald eagle from extinction, has been climbing trees to look into eagles’ nests and those of other raptors since he was a teenager in Virginia.",
  "“The strength is one thing, but the tenderness — it’s night and day when you get to see that up close.”\n\nWhen he’s sitting in a nest, Koppie can see the layers of sticks added over the years.",
  "Koppie made sure that the Eagle Cam hewed to the guidelines of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and he offered tree-climbing assistance when the cameras and wires were put in place.",
  "It’s not easy to climb a tree that big, but “if you’re really going to learn about raptors, you have to be able to get up into the trees and look at the life that occurs there,” Koppie says.",
  "To have it happen and to be part of that, I have fulfilled something in my life.”\n\nKoppie now mostly rescues orphaned chicks or consults for groups that want to install eagle cameras.",
  "Before putting up the camera, the foundation and its partners had to check in with Koppie, a wildlife biologist who has worked for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service for 33 years.",
  "(Wayne Gorrow/ )\n\nWhen he drops a startled orphan chick, like the one found in Maryland, into a new nest, the adult eagles always become willing foster parents, he says.",
  "Then “she lowers herself down, and uses the shoulders of her wings to gather them, and they’re under a blanket for the night.”\n\n“It’s absolutely beautiful,” he says.",
  "He can hear them, too: the muffled flapping of their massive wings, which can open to a span of seven feet, and a low guttural honking from the baby chicks.",
  "(Bryan Watts/ )\n\nEagles have been a symbol of strength and ferocity long before they became our national bird — as far back as the days of the Roman Empire.",
  "By that time, there were only 80 nesting pairs in the Chesapeake Bay, compared with the estimated 6,000 that had thrived there in the 18th century.",
  "Over the next several decades, the bald eagle came back and was removed from the federal list of threatened and endangered species in August 2007.",
  "Around 1,600 nesting pairs live around the bay, and there are 143,000 individual eagles in the country, according to Fish and Wildlife data.",
  "(Kennon Smith / )\n\nBald eagles build their nests, which can be six feet across and four feet deep, 85 to 115 feet off the ground.",
  "The eagle parents can use their huge talons to kill, but they can also rip a fish into miniscule morsels to feed to their young.",
  "“I’ve watched the mother use her talons to hold the straw or grass that they brought up and tuck it around” the chicks, he says.",
  "Last year, he treated a baby with a cold in a falcon’s nest on the 33rd floor of the Transamerica building in Baltimore.",
  "He recently responded to a call in Maryland, where an orphaned eaglet was caught in a soccer net at a middle school.",
  "Eagles were dying out due to loss of habitat, hunting and the pesticide DDT, which affected the birds’ fertility.",
  "The birds build them 85 to 115 feet off the ground, in huge trees with trunks up to eight feet in diameter.",
  "This gradation is a physical record of the eagles’ family life, and of how long they’ve been together.",
  "The ones from the previous year will be weathered and a lighter brown than the sticks from this year.",
  "There are currently three nests here in Washington, including the pair the D.C. Eagle Cam spotlights.",
  "Koppie was 16 when he climbed into his first nest, a red-tailed hawk’s 70 feet up in a Virginia pine.",
  "In 1977, the National Wildlife Federation contacted him to help save the bald eagle from extinction.",
  "Nationally, there were fewer than 500 nesting pairs, according to Fish and Wildlife Service data.",
  "He traveled to 10 nests in four years to adopt babies from eagles that had more than two chicks.",
  "“Here I am, here I come,” he says in low, soothing tones, to let the birds know that he’s close.",
  "Koppie with an adult female bald eagle at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Maryland.",
  "Koppie with a wintering golden eagle at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Maryland.",
  "(Teena Gorrow)\n\nCraig Koppie starts talking when he’s 10 feet below a bald eagle nest.",
  "In the 1980s, Koppie helped relocate chicks from Canada to populate the United States.",
  "He had no equipment, just adolescent spunk and a budding naturalist’s curiosity.",
  "Koppie says that eagles generally bring dry grass to the nest to help soften it.",
  "Koppie remembers pulling infertile eggs out of nests near the bay in the 1970s.",
  "This is a version of the eagle that Koppie has known for most of his career.",
  "What viewers saw when the D.C. Eagle Cam went live was a little different.",
  "Koppie now sees things he never would have thought possible in the 1970s.",
  "Eagles mate for life and will use the same nest for rearing each season.",
  "There are four nests in the Chesapeake Bay area with four babies each.",
  "“I’ve had a front-row seat to the recovery of a species,” Koppie says.",
  "If a pair did manage to reproduce, there would be only one offspring.",
  "Eagle nests are huge — as much as six feet across and four feet deep.",
  "And to any parent, that rearing can seem oddly familiar.",
  "“And they weren’t just a regular species.",
  "They were my passion.",
  "And he was hooked."
