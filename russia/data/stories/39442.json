  "The interview took place Wednesday and likely centered around two pivotal events in which Sater was a participant: the Trump Organization's effort to secure a Trump Tower deal in Moscow at the height of the 2016 US election, and Trump transition officials' proposal for a controversial Ukraine-Russia \"peace plan\" that appeared to favor Moscow.",
  "In addition to Sater, Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen was also instrumental in both events, and Sater's testimony will likely help investigators get a clearer picture of the episodes and whether other higher-ranking members of the Trump administration or Trump Organization played a role.",
  "According to BuzzFeed, Senate investigators recently asked the US Treasury Department for financial information related to Sater and his real-estate company, Bayrock Group, which did business with the Trump Organization in the early 2000s and currently has its offices at Trump Tower in New York.",

  "The Times reported that Cohen, Sater, and the Ukrainian politician Andrey Artemenko were the key figures involved in pushing for the proposal, which was delivered to then national security adviser Michael Flynn last year.",
  "Cohen then shifted his story again, saying he met with Artemenko for less than 10 minutes in New York to discuss a proposal Artemenko said \"was acknowledged by Russian authorities that would create world peace.\"",
  "While Cohen and Sater are both longtime associates of Trump, Artemenko is said to have met with the Trump campaign before the election and has signaled opposition to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.",
  "But Cohen was advocating the project as late as January 2016, when he contacted Dmitry Peskov, a top aide to Putin, and asked for his help in pushing the Trump Tower Moscow deal through.",

  "Reuters/Jorge Silva\n\nSater later walked back his comments in an interview with BuzzFeed, telling the outlet he had exaggerated his relationship with Putin in order to secure the deal.",
  "The plan Artemenko, Sater, and Cohen pushed would have the US lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for Moscow's withdrawing its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.",
  "\"And the local developer there would have gotten financing from VTB and/or another Russian bank, but VTB at that point was the go-to bank for real-estate development.\"",
  "He also told Talking Points Memo last August that his \"last Moscow deal\" for the Trump Organization \"was in October of 2015\" but that it did not end up going through.",
  "Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters\n\nCohen attracted significant scrutiny when he offered evolving explanations of his involvement in the conception and delivery of the plan.",

  "Poroshenko, who assumed the presidency in 2014 after the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych, has demonstrated more affinity than his predecessor toward the West.",

  "Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal.",
  "Help world peace and make a lot of money, I would say that's a great lifetime goal for us to go after.\"",
  "\"Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\" Sater wrote, according to The Times.",
  "It would also allow Russia to maintain control over the territory of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.",
  "\"Lets make this happen and build a Trump Moscow,\" Sater wrote in a note attached to the letter.",
  "\"Mr. Sater has long served as a high-level intelligence asset for various government agencies.",
  "He added that the meeting lasted less than 15 minutes and that he left with the plan in hand.",
  "Sater's revelation to Hayes was likely a key component of lawmakers' questions on Wednesday.",
  "That should be Putins message as well, and we will help him agree on that message.",
  "He told Business Insider in February 2017 that he did not know what the plan was.",
  "Sater added: \"I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.\"",
  "\"We were still working on it, doing something with it, November-December.\"",
  "\"Mr. Sater told the Times that Mr. Cohen had told him the same thing.\"",
