  "“We need to do something right now because when the regime changes, we won’t be able to do anything without this experience,” she told USA TODAY in written comments.",
  "“If there is going to be overt rigging on the day, it will most likely be to inflate the turnout to a respectable figure, not to change the results,” Galeotti said.",
  "Although some leaders and members of these parties occasionally speak out against the Kremlin, they have consistently voted to pass laws the Kremlin wanted passed.",
