  "But if the comediennes got caught up in a content-constricting algorithm, they got caught up in it for a reason: They’ve pushed conspiracy theories from Uranium One to Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) supposed secret “gay lifestyle,” and during the campaign they stumped for Trump in an interview with a neo-Nazi Holocaust denier who insists that “Jews Did 9/11.”\n\nPerhaps this messy history doesn’t mean Diamond and Silk deserve for Facebook to restrict their posts’ reach or prevent them from alerting their followers to new videos.",
  "Diamond and Silk, according to sisters Lynette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, are not only “Vloggers, Public Figures & Speakers” as well as “Internet, Radio & TV Personality,” but also “President Donald J Trump’s Most Outspoken & Loyal Supporters.” In other words, Diamond and Silk post videos proclaiming Trump’s virtues in bombastic style — sometimes in rap form.",
  "But that means inviting government to involve itself more actively in Internet affairs, and the involvement could stretch beyond rules that protect consumers from privacy violations: While Republicans are usually wary of interfering in an industry’s affairs, many appear willing to break the rule to thwart what they see as an anti-right cabal in Silicon Valley.",
  "It’s a test case for a quandary that Facebook has been muddling through since last summer, when the world and Web exploded with revelations that Russia had harnessed the platform’s reach to sow discord with destructive propaganda — and when, about the same time, Charlottesville also exploded with white-nationalist vitriol.",

  "(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nEditorial Writer\n\nThe extended inquisition of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill this week has revealed that many confused members of Congress had one overarching question: What exactly is this Internet thing, anyway?",
  "“Facebook routinely suppressed conservative stories from the trending news … initially shut down the ‘Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day’ page … and most recently blocked Trump supporters Diamond and Silk’s page, with 1.2 million Facebook followers,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)",
  "To the 87 million Facebook users affected by the Cambridge Analytica breach (and the millions more who’ve had their data scraped by some other less-than-savory actor), the Diamond and Silk affair may seem beside the point.",
  "Now, the focus has shifted to security, and discussion of any regulation to come has centered on users’ ability to control the information they allow Facebook to access in exchange for its free services.",
  "Before we were asking the company to keep our data safe from advertisers, we were asking it to keep our democracy safe from foreign interference, and our online communities safe from abuse.",
  "To “a great many Americans,” Cruz said, that appears to be “a pervasive pattern of political bias.”\n\n“I’d like to show you right now a little picture here,” said Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.",
  "They went viral in 2016 as black women in support of the then-candidate, and they went viral again last week when they accused Zuckerberg and his company of censoring them.",

  "At the same time, we were asking it to stay neutral — an almost impossible task.",
  "But one senator and a surprising number of representatives seemed to disagree.",
