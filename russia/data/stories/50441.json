  "My concern is how is it that we can have a nation that is built on the love of immigrants on the engagement of people coming from the other places in the world bringing their skills and talents, and then you have Donald Trump who would speak against the U.S. Constitution while saying that he would like to take the oath of office where he has to uphold the Constitution against the...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLEMON: But you heard -- you heard he's had his defenders coming on here certainly as he had his detractors, but he said people who defended him, you heard people in the crowd cheering him.",

  "This man has talked about whether or not or saying that he could not say definitively whether he would support Japanese interment, and it is 2015, a month away from 2016, this is the man who is talking about banning Muslims where all of the GOP maybe except for Crystal is speaking out against it, because it is terrible, not only for their autopsy plan which, John, at this point is very vet...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWRIGHT: All the GOP, and all of New Hampshire?",
  "Either of the violent kind or by the way, a kind that the Muslim brotherhood called civilization Jihad, sort of stealthy kind of Jihad rather than the people who are just seeking to come here for a better life or economic opportunity or...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n[22:10:12] LEMON: It sounds -- it sounds like a defector agreement with...\n\n\n\nGAFFNEY: ... something we have -- we have to get sorted.",
  "And I think that this is really, when you take a look at the circumstances that we have right now, we have 525 people killed in five separate incidents by ISIS, it's clearly not contained, and they...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLEMON: But when you look at this, you said that you are surprised, Mr. Clovis, if you will pardon me, you said you're surprised by this.",
  "I think that what we are really looking for here is to have some confidence given to the American people that the United States government has a good idea of who is coming into this country, and why they're coming into this country, and how long they're going to stay in this country, and for what purpose are they coming into this country.",
  "LEMON: I think, gentlemen, both of you, it's interesting that the feedback that you get immediately that, you know, this is a democratic ploy, oh, my gosh, this is liberal, he is getting more criticism of the republicans actually than he is getting from democrats with the idea that this is some sort of liberal agenda is just preposterous.",
  "The broad picture here is that Muslim Americans, the polling data and their opinions about the American politics, their own faith and the integration of themselves into the body politic into the United States is overwhelmingly encouraging, particularly when you contrast that to Muslim populations in Europe or in the Middle East.",
  "CLOVIS: Well, I think let's characterize it properly, Don, I think what he was -- he made a few, if you listen to quote exactly, it was a temporary situation, I think that the implication of what he said is that if he were enforcing our immigration laws appropriately at this point in time, we might have a better handle on this.",
  "What I want to make clear about what's just been said is, this is a moment where we should be hoping Muslims who are not part of the problem, and Muslims who do not embrace Sharia, who do not embrace the Jihad that it commands, who do not want to impose it on the rest of us, and empower them and not organizations like CAIR.",
  "CLOVIS: Well, I would like to is to take a look at really a screening process that we enforce the laws that we have, and right now because of the circumstances in San Bernardino and the other four attacks that ISIS has had around the world, the fact that they are out there, and we have people coming into the country.",
  "It is very much needed at the moment, because we seem to be pursuing if there is a strategy to it at all, one hoping that through increasing weakness we will somehow ameliorate our situation, vis-a- vis among others, not exclusively, but among others Jihadists who seek explicitly our destruction.",
  "So, we pretended it we were doing it based on nationality, but if you go into the congressional debates, you see Senator Bilbo and others, talking about how we have to keep the Jews out, because they will come into this country and change this country and turn it into a terrible, terrible place.",
  "BRINKLEY: Well, I was just going to say, I mean, I heard Donald Trump starting to equate his comments about Muslims to FDR and the Japanese internment camps, somehow equating San Bernardino with the two kind of loose cannons with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and killing 2,400 Americans.",
  "You talked about CNN standards, the fact that you have those guys on and you don't identify them as Muslim brotherhood, when we know that the mission, the stated mission of the Muslim brotherhood in America is to destroy Western civilization from within is a real disservice to your viewers.",
  "The fact is the media, Don, tonight, you have spent your entire show talking about Donald Trump, his double-digit lead in New Hampshire and his plan to shut down the borders -- shutdown America to Muslims who want to immigrate, and we were not...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLEMON: Quickly, Crystal.",

  "Let's find out where these people are, who they are, where they're coming from, and let's find some way just to be able to able to enforce the laws that exist out there... (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLEMON: And you said find out who these people are, you're not talking about all Muslims, right?",
  "What exactly one does, and for how long one does it in order to try to ascertain when more people who are coming from the nations notably those that have a tradition of Islamic supremacist and in some cases Jihad seeking to impose what doctrine they call Sharia on the rest of us.",
  "LEMON: When we're talking about -- when we're talking about the poll, the poll that Donald Trump cited when he...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n[22:15:00] GAFFNEY: I had nothing to do with him citing that poll, I'm delighted that he pointed out the facts that we determine in that poll.",
  "And still ahead tonight, I'm going to ask the leading imam, if a leading imam, if he fears that Trump's comments will lead to a backlash against Muslims in the United States, and it's Trump's call to block Muslim immigration, is it even legal, is there a precedent for it.",
  "The circumstances on the ground are driving this, the issue is that we have uncertainty in this country, the government is not enforcing the immigration laws that we have, we'd like to find out if we can hit that reset button that Hillary Clinton talks so much about.",
  "But when you have something that reads, so we can back up, it starts with Donald J -- Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States until our country, our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.",
  "And so, the republicans are sort in a conundrum, but if there is been a bright shining star in the last 24 hours of the story, it's that the GOP are most of the other candidates, maybe Ted Cruz is in the middle, but all of them have denounced Donald Trump for this.",
  "WRIGHT: So, I think the question is that Donald Trump is raising, are you more afraid of shutting the borders to Muslims who want to emigrate in or who offended, I should say rather, or you're more offended by more Americans getting killed and slaughtered by ISIS.",
  "And Alan just mentioned Thomas Jefferson, and you know, one of the most moving documents I've ever seen is after the Louisiana Purchase, a nun in New Orleans wrote to Mr. Jefferson and basically said \"I speak French and I'm Catholic, will America welcome me?\"",
  "So, Trump's, there is a plenty of bigotry and xenophobia and anti- immigration sentiments, it's a strain but it's the dark strain of America...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nDERSHOWITZ: And let's remember...\n\n\n\nBRINKLEY: ... and that's what Donald Trump is tapping into.",
  "This particular guest on your show has called David Petraeus, the general who rescue the Iraq war, a man who submitted to Sharia law, because he said that the burning of the Quran is going to make it more difficult for us to conduct national security policy.",
  "If you go back to 1968, George Wallace running for president, and was, you know, he won a lot of the south, he won the southern states, at one point he had 50 percent of white males wanting you, Don Lemon, not to have rights, not to have the right to vote.",
  "O'DONNELL: And actually, I'm beginning to believe that Donald Trump isn't really a republican, he may even be a democratic plant because we were talking about the president and his speech on Sunday night all day on Monday until Trump made his comments.",

  "We have 38 countries that people show up with a passport and they don't have to have a visa, they come into this country, they don't have -- they come in on that, and what -- and what do we have right now today in illegal immigration?",
  "And in the climate of fear, of intolerance, and I am going to be honest, if we take this approach of accepting this kind of intolerance, we will be no better than ISIS and the others who are intolerant of other faiths and other ideas.",
  "So, Douglas Brinkley, we can argue about what the Constitution says, but isn't religious freedom and the idea that we treat people as individuals and not members of a suspect group woven into the fabric of our nation at this point.",
  "Let me ask you this, because some people are saying because we do have laws on the books now that say, you know, certain people, if you -- if you are a threat to the United States, that you may not be able to enter this country.",
  "And frankly, while we were at war then with Japan and we did, the lowest ebb of FDR's entire, largely wonderful presidency was doing those Japanese internment camps, but it was against the Japanese at war time, not Buddhist.",
  "And by the way, I couldn't help but notice in a previous program just before you came on, Don, and I'm not sure you had a chance to see it, but someone come on there and talk about the fact that the visa program is working.",
  "CLOVIS: I think that she came over here on a fiance visa, gave a false address, and it says -- and one of the reports that we had on earlier said that lying is the reason to be denied entry into the United States.",
  "The Supreme Court has held consistently for more than a century that constitutional protections that normally benefit Americans do not apply when Congress decides who to admit and who to exclude as immigrants.\"",
  "We don't want it, because you are terrorist, and every one of you are terrorist, and I don't care what you say or think, and you can smile at me, you can say whatever you want, but every Muslim is a terrorist.",
  "I think that probably as much as I need to say about that, if that's -- if that's the best they can do journalistically, then probably, you know, that's probably their own areas that they have to worry about.",
  "MICHAEL WEISS, THE DAILY BEAST SENIOR EDITOR: Well, Mr. Gaffney's organization put out this poll Donald Trump cited as a legitimization of his claim that we should essentially shutdown all Muslim immigration.",
  "This is a selective effort I think to minimize a problem that frankly, Americans think you are nuts, sir, not me, because the evidence that Jihad, you've written about it in connection with the Islamic state.",
  "GAFFNEY: But the point is I think virtually that every American thinks we should not be willy-nilly in importing more Jihadists...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLEMON: Are there any points where you disagree with him?",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'DONNELL: Oh, they're rejoicing over Donald Trump's comments, because we've now taken the focus off this president's failed policies in Syria and Iraq and what he is not doing to stop ISIS.",
  "I'm sorry, but what I'm hearing now is nothing short of 1930 style isolationism and xenophobia, dressed up as this grandiose policy proclamation that this is the way to solve problem America's problem.",
  "And I have come on the show, I've gone on many CNN programs and talk about the threat post based by Islamic states and Al Qaeda, and also the intractability of domestic U.S. policy from foreign policy.",
  "And instead of having that conversation, and instead of being on offense, against his Secretary of State who basically wrote these policies, we are talking about Donald Trump's comments all day long.",
  "And so, the idea that America would become a country that has a broad prohibition against all Muslims, even people who fight against ISIS would be so inconsistent with the character of this country.",
  "They found that just 1 percent of the American Muslims believe that quote \"Suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian targets are often justified to defend Islam from its enemies.\"",
