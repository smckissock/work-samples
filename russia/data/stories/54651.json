Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) August 31, 2016\n\nHillary Clinton is giving a foreign policy speech right now that sounds like it was written by Genghis Khan.",

  "— Murtaza Hussain (@MazMHussain) August 31, 2016\n\nOthers, including Vox's Matt Yglesias, pointed to the irony of Clinton of Clinton decrying cozying up to dictators given that the Clinton Foundation took millions of dollars from the governments of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.",
