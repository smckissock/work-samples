  "WASHINGTON -- The FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, because the government had reason to believe Page was acting as a Russian agent, The Washington Post reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement and other U.S. officials.",
  "Page was sharply critical of the U.S. in his remarks, saying Washington has a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”\n\nDays later, Page talked with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. at an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.",
  "He also noted that his office building in New York “is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.”\n\nPage, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker who worked out of its Moscow office for three years, now runs Global Energy Capital, a firm focused on energy sectors in emerging markets.",
  "“I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Café, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year,” Page wrote.",
  "“It will be interesting to see what comes out when the unjustified basis for those FISA requests are more fully disclosed over time,” said Page, using an acronym to refer to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
  "The Post, citing the same officials, said the government surveillance application laid out the basis for the belief that Page had knowingly engaged in intelligence activities on Russia’s behalf.",
  "Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with the Russian envoy at the same event, a conversation he failed to reveal when asked about contacts with Russians during his Senate confirmation hearings.",
  "One campaign official said Page was recruited by Sam Clovis, an Iowa Republican operative who ran the Trump campaign’s policy shop and is now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department.",
  "Page is among the Trump associates under scrutiny as the FBI and congressional committees investigate whether his presidential campaign had ties to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.",
  "“It shows how low the Clinton/Obama regime went to destroy our democracy and suppress dissidents who did not fully support their failed foreign policy,” Page said in the statement.",
  "But in a letter Page sent to the Senate Intelligence Committee last month, he cast himself as a regular presence in Trump Tower, where the campaign was headquartered.",
  "Page’s relationship with Russia began to draw scrutiny during the campaign after he visited Moscow in July 2016 for a speech at the New Economic School.",
  "Those contacts are detailed in a 2015 court filing involving a case against three men charged in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spying ring.",
  "Page was a little-known investment banker when Mr. Trump announced him as a member of his foreign policy advisory team early last year.",
  "While Page said he was traveling in a personal capacity, the school cited his role in the Trump campaign in advertising the speech.",
  "Mr. Trump’s aides insist the president has no relationship with Page and did not have any dealings with him during the campaign.",
  "Judges grant permission for surveillance if they agree there’s probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power.",
  "According to the company’s website, he has advised on transactions for Gazprom and RAO UES, a pair of Russian entities.",
  "Those who served on the campaign’s foreign policy advisory committee also said they had limited contact with Page.",
  "The Post reported that a 90-day warrant was issued for Page and has been renewed more than once by the FISA court.",
  "Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but the investigations could shadow his presidency for months or even years.",
  "The campaign began distancing itself from Page after his trip to Russia, saying he was only an informal adviser.",
  "The newspaper said the application includes contacts Page had with a Russian intelligence operative in 2013.",
  "Page issued a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, saying that he was “happy to hear” about the Post’s report.",
  "An FBI spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment from The Associated Press.",
  "According to the filing, Page provided one of the men documents about the energy industry.",
  "Though the standard sets a high bar, applications are hardly ever denied.",
  "By the fall, he appeared to have cut ties to the Republican campaign.",
  "It’s unclear how Page was connected with the Trump campaign.",
  "The FISA court and its orders are highly secretive.",
  "Page has denied having improper ties to Russia.",
  "He was not charged as part of that case."
