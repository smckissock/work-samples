  "An hour before MEPs and guests were to watch \"The Magnitsky Act â€” Behind the scenes,\" which defends the Russian government against allegations that it was behind the murder of prominent whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyers stepped in, calling the documentary \"degrading.\"",
  "\"We believe that the film by Andrei Nekrasov, based on his inventions and not on documents and facts, is degrading to the dignity of Sergei Magnitsky, degrading to the deceased, who cannot defend himself,\" Zharikova said in a statement.",
  "Nekrasov's film argues that Magnitsky, rather than revealing details of a Russian plot to steal billions of dollars from taxpayers and dying at the hands of police, as most of the world believes, was in fact a criminal himself.",
  "Pavel Karpov, one of the Russian security officers whom Magnitsky accused of embezzlement, attended the event in Brussels and criticized Browder for having the film pulled, stating: \"I guess the truth has finally come out.\"",
