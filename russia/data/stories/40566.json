  "Three revelations in the past week have raised new questions from lawmakers about the Trump team's relations with Russian leaders and broadened Congress's inquiries into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia in its effort to sway the 2016 presidential election.",
  "The disclosures of private meetings came as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking at a NATO meeting, said the U.S. will maintain its sanctions against Russia until Moscow \"reverses its actions\" in neighboring Ukraine, where it has annexed part of the country.",
  "While Page's interactions with Podobnyy are a clear example of contact with a Russian spy, Page said in a statement that he believed Podobnyy was\"a junior attach√© at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.\"",
  "A push to separate Russia from its Middle East ally might require lifting or easing sanctions against Russia, which would face strong opposition from Europe and Congress, where there is strong bipartisan support for sanctions.",

  "Page said in a statement that he gave Podobnyy \"nothing more than a few samples\" from detailed lectures he gave at New York University for a course about energy markets and politics.",
  "The significance\n\nRussian efforts to get intelligence from Page show the sensitivity of his energy-consulting work in Russia and his desirability to Russian intelligence operatives.",
  "If Trump officials knew of or sanctioned Prince's meeting, that raises new questions about Trump's agenda for Russia and about any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.",
