  "Cooper Hefner, Playboy’s chief creative officer and son of the magazine’s founder, tweeted early Wednesday that Facebook’s “content guidelines and corporate policies” continue to contradict Playboy’s “values.”\n\nFacebook, Hefner’s tweet reads, “continues to be sexually repressive.”\n\nHefner goes on to say that the “recent meddling in a free U.S. election further demonstrates another concern we have of how they handle users’ data,” adding that “more than 25 million” of those affected by the meddling “are Playboy fans.”\n\nFacebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who may appear before Congress, apologized for the scandal with ads in multiple U.S. and British newspapers Sunday, saying the social media platform doesn’t deserve to hold personal information if it can’t protect it.",
