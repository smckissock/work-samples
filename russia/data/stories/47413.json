  "Morgan Stanley (Overweight):\n\n\"The stories change is most notable as we believe the \"stories\" headwind is a combination of Facebook's decision to increase its emphasis on pushing core Facebook users to the stories format at a faster rate (which only has 150 million users, or about 10 percent penetration) and the fact that the stories format (on Instagram and Facebook core) is still monetizing at materially lower rates than News Feed.",
  "UBS (Downgrade to Neutral from Buy):\n\n\"After a pronounced selloff in response to management comments about forward growth and margin trajectory, we now see the risk/reward as balanced for Facebook going forward â€“ strong momentum in Instagram measured against regulatory attention, investments to transform/protect ecosystem, and slowing engagement/more mature ad trends at core Facebook.",
  "The two theories we could come up with as to why Facebook is guiding revenue down severely with the third quarter and fourth quarter now expected to both decelerate high single digits sequentially are: 1) they don't want to create the perception of getting rich while their product presents issues for society (but why didn't this happen on the Jan/April calls?",
  "While the outlook was a negative surprise and cautious read on core Facebook engagement growth trends and long-term infrastructure costs that will linger as overhangs, we expect some support for the stock on the view that there is upside potential vs a low bar, and that revenues could re-accelerate after a usage shift (stories, video) adjustment period.\"",
  "The company's promotion of Stories will contribute to the deceleration as well, as the ads in Stories monetize at lower rates than inventory in Feed (negatively impacting overall price per ad), and any Feed inventory used to promote Stories would obviously not be available to paying advertisers, negatively impacting impression growth.\"",
  "Goldman Sachs (Buy):\n\n\"The company guided to a high single-digit deceleration in as-reported year over year revenue growth in each of 3Q18 and 4Q18 driven by the reversal in FX, the promotion of lower monetizing experiences like Stories, and the impact of data privacy controls on monetization.",
  "Indeed, our industry conversations indicate that sponsored stories ad unit completion rates are less than 1 percent (multiples lower than News Feed) in part because users' 'tap-based' stories consumption drives ad skipping.",
  "In our opinion, the new growth drivers (Instagram, Watch, Stories, Messenger/WhatsApp, VR) frankly aren't big enough over the short/medium term to alter the decelerating growth and margin pressure profile of the P&L.\"",
  "Bank of America (Buy):\n\n\"While results disappointed, the stock fell close to 20 percent after hours during the earnings call on Facebook's forward looking outlook.",
  "Facebook shares tanked after the company's daily active users fell short of expectations and the company warned revenue growth would slow the rest of the year.",
  "Currency provided a roughly 5 percentage point tailwind in the first half of 2018, and we expect an approximate 60 basis point headwind in the second half.",
  "Barclays (Overweight):\n\n\"We haven't seen this disastrous a print since the first-quarter-2016 LinkedIn massacre that brought the entire NASDAQ down.",
  "As of Thursday morning, the social media giant's stock FB was set for its worst day ever, with shares down nearly 20 percent in premarket trading.",
  "J.P. Morgan (Overweight):\n\n\"Facebook's second-quarter results and outlook are disappointing, but 'startling' is probably a better word.",
  "), or 2) there are more serious engagement problems with core Facebook that have materialized recently that they are trying to fix.",
  "Until last night's print, Facebook shares had rallied 43 percent off the late March Cambridge Analytica-induced low in the stock.",
  "Yet, Facebook remains in the crosshairs of regulators & politicians, and data/privacy policies and products are just kicking in.\"",
  "Facebook is battling its own scale & law of large numbers, w/FXN revenue generally decelerating over the past two years.",
  "Stepping back, Facebook is now shifting from the top of the sentiment pedestal to very shaky ground.\"",
  "We also think Facebook is taking the opportunity to shift expectations to more achievable levels.",
  "Facebook's guide down speaks to the growing importance to drive stories engagement/monetization.\"",
  "Here's a wrap of all the major analyst opinions going out to Wall Street pros on Tuesday.",
  "As noted above, there are some specific challenges related to user behavior & policies.",
  "We think few, if any, anticipated this kind of reset.",
  "For comparison, the S&P 500 has risen 9 percent.",
  "The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.",
