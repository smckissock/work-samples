  "In a conference call with reporters to discuss Facebook’s recent moves, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he wasn’t sure precisely how many people were affected, but repeated that the sophistication of the scraping led the company to think that most people’s profiles might have been hoovered up.",
  "Facebook had already “rate-limited” these types of searches, preventing people from just typing hundreds of numbers into the box over and over, but “malicious actors” whom Zuckerberg did not identify were able to work around that safeguard.",
  "Users do have a privacy setting that could prevent them from being searched by phone number or email address, but few people had it switched on because most people didn’t (and never do) change the default.",
  "Specific to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook announced that they believe the data from 87 million profiles may have been exfiltrated by the company, mostly in the United States.",
  "That’s a large increase from the 50-million-profiles number that’s been at the center of the discussion, and represents a substantial chunk of Facebook’s American user base.",
  "This new round was touched off by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, acting through affiliates and researchers, built a database of tens of millions of profiles.",
  "The bottom line, Zuckerberg said, is that “if you had that setting turned on, I would assume that someone has accessed your public information in that way.”",
  "They “cycled through hundreds of thousands of IP addresses and did a relatively small number of queries for each one,” Zuckerberg said.",
  "This is the latest in a series of revelations about data leaking out of Facebook’s massive storehouses of user information."
