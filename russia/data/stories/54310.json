  "On Wednesday afternoon, the ranking members on the Senate and House Antitrust Subcommittees wrote to Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, asking for \"any information that you may have concerning payments made by AT&T that may have influenced the Administration, White House, or transition regarding the AT&T/Time Warner transaction.\"",
  "The statement began: \"In early 2017, as President Trump was taking office, we hired several consultants to help us understand how the President and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues important to the company, including regulatory reform at the FCC, corporate tax reform and antitrust enforcement.\"",
  "\"I think it ought to be a topic for the judiciary committee in connection with its continuing investigation, which I hope will review not only those payments, but also those payments that may well have been used to influence the president of the United States,\" Blumenthal said.",
  "AT&T is generally supportive of the Trump administration's moves to change net neutrality rules, though the company has publicly called on Congress to settle the internet freedom debate by passing a federal net neutrality law.",
  "The timing of the payments is noteworthy in part because AT&T had several key issues in front of the administration, including net neutrality regulations and a $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, CNN's parent company.",
  "In an initial statement on Tuesday, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants \"was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration.\"",
  "AT&T pointed out that \"companies often hire consultants for these purposes, especially at the beginning of a new Presidential Administration, and we have done so in previous Administrations, as well.",
  "The payments have the appearance of a secretive attempt to buy access to the president or perhaps even attempt to sway his opinion on the issues AT&T has pending in front of the government.",
  "He alleged that AT&T made payments totaling $200,000 -- $50,000 a month for four months -- to Essential Consultants, a shell company set up by Cohen shortly before the 2016 election.",
  "The wireless provider -- which is seeking to buy CNN's parent company Time Warner -- confirmed on Wednesday that it was contacted by Mueller's office late last year.",
  "AT&T confirms it paid Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's company\n\nIn a message to employees on Wednesday, AT&T elaborated on its initial explanation of the contract.",
  "The Senators made the comments during a Wednesday press conference about net neutrality, an issue that's been a key focus of AT&T public policy advocacy.",
  "The message also pointed out that the \"current controversy surrounding Cohen\" did not erupt until January 2018, one month after the AT&T contract ended.",
  "But a source with knowledge of the matter said it was logical to seek \"insights\" about the new administration from one of Trump's longtime confidants.",
  "But the judge on the case blocked discovery on communications between the White House and the Justice Department and AT&T dropped that defense.",
  "Cohen used Essential Consultants to pay Daniels $130,000 to keep her from speaking publicly about an alleged affair with Trump years prior.",
  "According to a source with knowledge of the matter, the contract with Cohen's firm started shortly after inauguration day in January.",
  "Two key senators, Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey, say they want the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate the payments.",
  "CNN reported on Wednesday that Cohen aggressively pitched himself to companies as a unique source of access to the president.",
  "The payments are now under scrutiny because Cohen -- often described as Trump's \"fixer\" -- is under federal investigation.",
  "During the transition, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Cohen both visited Trump Tower on the morning of January 12, 2017.",
  "Since then, we have received no additional questions from the Special Counsel's office and consider the matter closed.\"",
  "\"We cooperated fully, providing all information requested in November and December of 2017,\" AT&T said in a statement.",
  "AT&T declined to answer questions on Wednesday about how it became aware of Cohen's firm or who approved the contract.",
  "The trial recently wrapped up, and a judge is expected to issue a decision on June 12, though it could come sooner.",
  "All you had to do was watch CNN during the campaign,\" the source said, referring to Cohen's frequent appearances.",
  "Initially, AT&T sought to prove that the administration was unfairly singling the company out in the lawsuit.",
  "AT&T declined to comment on the total, but the source confirmed that the total did indeed exceed $200,000.",
  "The public is just now learning about AT&T's payments to President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen.",
  "Cohen's firm \"did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,\" AT&T said.",
  "The AT&T-Cohen arrangement was made public on Tuesday by Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti.",
  "The two men arrived eight minutes apart, according to a press pool report from that day.",
  "\"A few weeks later, our consulting contract with Cohen expired at the end of the year.",
  "But an AT&T spokesman said the two men did not meet that day, and have never met.",
  "But Cohen was paid for almost all of 2017, according to the company's timeline.",
  "\"You didn't have to hire a search firm to know who was close to the president.",
  "But special counsel Robert Mueller knew about the payments six months ago.",
  "Trump's Justice Department ultimately sued to block the deal in November.",
  "Throughout 2017, AT&T sought approval for its takeover of Time Warner.",
  "Trump's latest shot at the press corps: 'Take away credentials?'",
  "Avenatti alleged that the payments totaled $200,000.",
  "CNN's Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.",
  "Several other companies also paid Cohen's firm.",
  "The White House says Trump denies the affair.",
  "Cohen was one of those consultants.\"",
  "Democratic lawmakers disagree."
