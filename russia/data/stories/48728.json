  "Much as Facebook waited until the Cambridge Analytica scandal to conduct a review of how user data was being used and identify concerns, so too did Verizon note that it had now conducted a review of its resale of customer location data and identified “a number of internal questions about how best to protect our customers’ location data” and that it would no longer enter into resale agreements “unless and until we are comfortable that we can adequately protect our customers’ location data.”\n\nThis raises the question of why Verizon waited until now, in the aftermath of a privacy scandal to conduct such a review, instead of constantly monitoring its program and proactively identifying these issues long ago?",
  "Whether its Walgreens leveraging a provision of HIPAA to commercialize our medical data without us realizing or the almost uncountable number of brokers that buy our data from almost every company and government agency we interact with each day and reselling that data to others, a large fraction of every datapoint ever created about you by a government or private entity is likely held by the data brokerage industry today and resold every day, making money on you, without you having the legal right to even know its happening, let alone have any right to stop it.",
  "Given that Verizon's advertising program placed no restrictions on the areas that could be geofenced, allowing advertisers to target visitors to sensitive facilities like the CIA or undisclosed intelligence facilities, it would be interesting to explore whether foreign powers were purchasing the Verizon data to track visitors to known US Government intelligence facilities and then follow them throughout the country to identify all of the unknown sensitive facilities and to generate a catalog of US intelligence personnel that could be used to track them abroad.",
  "That the nation’s top cellular phone networks have been quietly reselling the real-time locations of their customers to the shadowy world of data brokers, making it possible to track anyone in the country like a police-issue GPS tracker is an unfortunately stark and dangerous reminder that the Facebook - Cambridge Analytica scandal is a relatively small drop in the ocean compared to the myriad ways our most sensitive personal data is bought and sold each day in ways that could seriously endanger our lives.",
  "The legal right to do so may have been buried in a massive contract that I had no choice but to sign to use my cellphone, but I never knowingly granted the right to the company to sell my data and certainly have never seen any prominent displays or notifications from it that clearly spelled out in plain English that it was reselling my data and giving me an opportunity to order it to stop.",
  "While Verizon’s legal agreement with its users grants it the right to resell their data without notifying them or permitting them any control over that resale, it raises the question of whether it is truly informed consent to bury a lawyerly clause deep in a lengthy legal contract that few users read and that is filled with complex legal terminology that few users can likely understand.",
  "I asked the company whether it felt that most of its users were aware of this program and that it was reselling their location data and if so, what metrics it had to support that conclusion and if not, why it felt it was acceptable to resell its customers’ data without them understanding what was happening.",
  "Whether identifying when a target is waiting at a bus stop alone or simply mapping her daily pattern of life to determine her most vulnerable moments in a typical day, location information is extremely sensitive and one of the classes of private data that most connects the digital world to our physical one.",
  "Much of the privacy conversation about Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica story has been that if the company would just make a paid version of its website, it could eliminate ads, tracking and data targeting of those customers, allowing its two billion users to “buy” their privacy.",
  "Putting this all together, it seems in our surveillance society there is no way to escape being bought and sold - if its free, you’re likely paying for it by being repackaged and resold as data, but even if you’re paying for it, you’re still probably being resold, but paying for the privilege.",
  "Real-time high-resolution location data is a particularly dangerous datapoint for companies to sell given that it can be used by bad actors for everything from stalking to committing robbery, rape and murder or by foreign actors to map out national security.",
  "Earlier today Verizon and AT&T both pledged to largely stop reselling their customer’s real-time mobile phone locations to third-party commercial data brokers, though both companies noted that they would not entirely stop selling customer location data.",
  "Most importantly, however, I asked the company whether it would place a hard legal prohibition in its contracts with all data purchasers that explicitly banned them from using user data for any purpose other than those specific narrow use cases.",
  "To get a sense on just what “beneficial services” the company planned to continue to sell its data to, I asked Verizon if it would provide a list of the applications it deemed acceptable to continue to sell user data for.",
  "As I wrote extensively during the Facebook – Cambridge Analytica scandal, the real story that we haven’t been talking about is the myriad ways in which private companies buy and sell our data every day without us knowing.",
  "In 2016 I covered how advertisers could use Verizon’s Smart Rewards and Verizon Select programs to precisely geotarget ads to Verizon’s mobile customers based on their physical movements, by tracking their cell phones.",
  "Unsurprisingly, a company spokesperson declined to comment on any of these questions, offering instead two quotes from its letter to Senator Wyden stating that customer privacy is of tantamount importance to it.",
  "The problem with this utopian vision is that, as Verizon has taught us, even if you pay for something, you may still be surveilled and your most intimate private data be resold as an additional profit maker.",
  "Given that Verizon told the Associated Press that it intended to continue selling user data to selected parties, I asked whether it would publish a list of companies it planned to continue selling data to.",
  "I also asked it whether it planned to notify customers of all of the companies their data was sold to and to allow them to see a list of what companies their data is being sold to in the future.",
  "In our modern surveillance society, just because you’re paying for something doesn’t in any way mean you’re buying your privacy and won’t be surveilled like a free ad-supported service.",
  "The company argued to the AP that it was important that it continues to sell its user data to help “beneficial services” like preventing fraud and assisting stranded motorists.",
  "As a Verizon user myself, I was certainly not aware that Verizon was reselling my data to third-party data brokers and I have never granted it informed consent to do so.",
  "More to the question, why is Verizon only now offering that in the future it will no longer enter into agreements that it feels can’t protect its users’ data?",
  "Apple went as far as to emphasize that free services make the customer into the product and implicitly, that by buying a product, you're buying your privacy.",
  "It turns out one of the datasets that were for sale to these brokers was our real-time location information, courtesy of our cellphone providers.",
  "For anyone who thought their Facebook data being resold was bad, take a refresher course on the data brokerage industry to be truly frightened.",
  "This program, however, only allowed advertisers to geotarget ads, not bulk download the real-time movements of anyone in the country.",
  "It turns out there was far more to Verizon’s commercialization of its users’ private locations than was apparent.",
  "Perhaps they could even opt out entirely?",
  "Why wasn’t that the policy to begin with?",
  "Is there anything we can do about it?"
