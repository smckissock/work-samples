  "As relations between Moscow and the West have gone from guarded cooperation to hostile defiance under Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB head, the scope of intelligence activities, and the number of Russian spies operating in Europe, has “roughly doubled,” according to the former head of a major European power’s intelligence service, who added that in such matters, “estimates are by definition difficult.” The spy chief, who was still on active duty back in 2010, said he hadn’t heard of the Frith/Cherepanov case.",
  "The founding act is available, registered on November 2, 1995, mentioning Carlos Moreno and Henry Frith, “born November 9, 1957 … of New Zealand nationality, holder of work permit X-0671724-D, valid until September 6, 1995, renewal being solicited at the Provincial Department of Labour.”\n\nA FAILED APPROACH\n\n‘Your whole life is going to be in ruins’\n\nn the early summer days of 2010, the Frith legend unraveled.",
  "They will be suspected of being a double agent in any case, their passport will be taken away, and at best they will be considered a professional failure.”\n\nSources note another factor may have played a role in the decision not to go public with the Frith case in 2010: possible embarrassment to the Spanish intelligence service CNI, which learned about the case after a tip from their British counterparts.",
  "“The Russians are engaging in massive and voracious intelligence-gathering campaigns, fueled by still-substantial budgets and a Kremlin culture that sees deceit and secret agendas even where none exist,” wrote Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security affairs in a recent report on “Putin’s Hydra” for the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
  "I don’t think the Italian government, to name one, agrees that it should be treated as such, and that is also the case of many politicians in many EU countries.”\n\nAccording to another source, a couple of cases of Russian illegals have been uncovered since Frith’s abrupt departure for Moscow nearly six years ago.",
  "They may sometimes manage their own sources and agents, but mostly they are used as messengers for the SVR because the ‘official’ spies are under a surveillance that prevents them to move around much.” Official spies work out of embassies, operating largely in the open under cover of diplomatic immunity.",
  "Six years after a group of 10 Russian “illegals” was uncovered in the United States, the decision by European security services to publicize the Frith/Cherepanov case is motivated by a desire to draw attention to what an official calls the “dramatic increase” in the Kremlin’s espionage activities here.",
  "They’re not traitors, after all.”\n\nJUST FIT IN\n\n‘Mostly they are used as messengers’\n\nspects of the Cherepanov story remain unexplained, particularly the extent of any harm he possibly did to Western security by courting government sources in countries such as Croatia, which joined NATO in 2009.",
  "Cherepanov, said a member of the intelligence service involved in the operation, had a system that allowed him to communicate directly with Moscow — through which he received instructions on when and where to meet Russian agents in a third country, usually close to Spain.",
  "It’s not clear why Frith wasn’t detained at the airport the day after the failed attempt to turn him, but a Western intelligence source points out that “the precise facts to legally charge him in court may have been lacking” at the time, absent a confession.",
  "He ran Frimor Consultores, which presented itself as a “high value, reliable consultancy and business services company” specialized in “socio-economic studies.” Frith traveled frequently for business, mostly to Central Europe, sometimes as far away as Chile.",
  "Cherepanov vanished after his emergency exfiltration, disappearing from the radars of Western intelligence services, who believe he went back to Russia by one of the pre-planned exit routes often prepared for illegals in case they need to flee in a hurry.",
  "Some of the FBI 10 such as “Donald Heathfield” and “Tracey Foley,” posing as a couple of Canadian origin with two children, had been under surveillance for many years before they were arrested under their real names of Andrei Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova.",
  "Security services don’t like to wage open war with each other, and you don’t want the Russians to retaliate by, for example, kicking out some of your own official spooks or diplomats in Moscow.”Sometimes the crash attempt at recruitment doesn’t work.",
  "It also wants to keep on top of the European Union mood on topics such as economic sanctions, the antitrust probe launched against Gazprom, or even multilateral topics such as the state of discussions about the EU-U.S. free-trade agreement (TTIP).",
  "After Cherapanov disappeared, two Russian diplomats based in Madrid, Anton Olegovich Simbirsky, and Aleksandr Nikolayevich Samoshkin, were asked to leave Spain for their alleged involvement in running the Spanish mole, the European sources said.",
  "THE NEW SPYING GAME\n\n‘I’d say there are less than 15, more than 10’\n\ngents tasked with fighting Russian spying in Europe these days say they are concerned that the focus on anti-terrorism starves them of resources to contain the SVR’s offensive.",
  "The most spectacular post-war example was Günther Guillaume, the East German mole sent to West Germany in 1956, who rose to become the secretary of Chancellor Willy Brandt — and caused the latter’s downfall when he was finally unmasked in 1974.",
  "The real answer, of course, is that we don’t know.”\n\nBack in Madrid, the concierge at number 47 Calle Goya that used to house Frimor Consultores doesn’t remember anyone working there under that name, nor people associated with the business.",
  "The agent threatened: “The Spanish authorities are going to come, the police are going to come, there’s going to be a big scandal and your whole life is going to be in ruins.”\n\nThe next morning, Valdezate took Frith to the airport.",
  "When the case came to trial, within days of the arrests, the only thing that U.S. authorities alleged in court was that they were guilty of money laundering and of conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government.",
  "In one instance, pictures made available by a Western intelligence service purportedly show a diplomat pretend to urinate on the side of a secluded road, look around and retrieve the document from under a rock at the drop site.",
  "“You have the Commission, NATO, and Russians basically want to know what’s going on.”\n\n“A few years ago we had a NATO-Russia council that was working, and some information was freely exchanged,” noted another European diplomat.",
  "According to a European intelligence official who wasn’t involved in the Cherepanov case, even if they had stolen secrets or harmed security, “sometimes you just want to get rid of them and trade them against other assets.",
  "At that time, the EU was pushing the now-defunct Nabucco pipeline project that would have linked Turkey to Austria, which was a competitor for Russia’s gas giant Gazprom and a source of tension between the West and Moscow.",

  "A deputy head of the SVR’s “S” department that oversees deep cover operations, Poteyev, fearing that he had been uncovered by Russian counter-intelligence, had fled to the U.S. shortly before the FBI sprang into action.",
  "“Henry Frith,” these sources allege, was an alias for a Russian spy, a so-called “illegal” who lived for years under a carefully constructed “legend” — a false identity, complete with a fake history and background.",
  "The Jennings couple in the show leads a perfect Washington suburban life with their two children in the early 1980s, but are highly trained KGB operatives who run agents, kill and occasionally sleep with the enemy.",
  "“You choose the targets because they’re well integrated in the country they’ve lived in for many years.” That was the case of Frith, who had a partner, friends and a settled life which he seemed to cherish.",
  "By Pierre Briançon in Madrid | Illustrations by Luke Waller for POLITICO\n\nne June night in 2010, Henry Frith asked the son of his live-in partner for a lift to Madrid airport early the next morning.",
  "THE AMERICANS CONNECTION\n\nDeconstructing Lawrence Henry Frith\n\nuropean intelligence sources say Cherapanov was caught thanks to the same intelligence that led the FBI to the 10 illegals in the U.S.",
  "As for Moreno, he told me that his own consulting business, which he had operated independently from Frimor, started losing his public-sector customers soon after Frith/Cherepanov’s disappearance.",
  "Similarly, the European source aware of the Spanish case said that Frith had been under watch for “well over a year.” That gave time to counterespionage services to deconstruct Frith’s identity.",
  "He tried to “turn” his target and make him a double agent: “I have the opportunity here to make your life a lot, lot better.”\n\nTime and again, the other man insisted he was really Henry Frith.",

  "In June 2011, a former SVR official, Colonel Alexandr Poteyev, was found guilty of high treason and desertion by a Russian military court, and sentenced to 25 years in prison in absentia.",
  "Tracked down one recent morning at his office, he reluctantly agreed to come downstairs for a quick chat outside, near the security post of the technology company he works at in Madrid.",
  "Frith probably stayed under the radar of Spanish counterintelligence for so long because he avoided direct contact with Russian agents on Spanish soil, an intelligence source said.",
  "As he was leaving the Starbucks, Moreno, who wasn’t told “Henry” was a suspected Russian spy in his meeting with me, said he kept thinking about what happened to his former friend.",
  "Whatever that man did, Valdezate said, he wants to remember the person who had been a caring companion for his mother throughout her ordeal, and he won’t say a bad word about him.",
  "Russia, they say, is eagerly searching for information on what goes on in NATO, as it is testing the Atlantic Alliance’s will to defend newest members such as the Baltic states.",
  "The Madrid commercial registry keeps a trace of Frimor, which has been “provisionally” closed for not registering its accounts in the years following Frith’s disappearance.",
  "Even after his meeting with the Spanish security services, Valdezate said that he only accepted that Frith wasn’t coming back when he didn’t show up for Carmen’s funeral.",
  "“Have you got just a few minutes to chat with me?” the agent asked, according to a transcript of their recorded conversation provided by a European intelligence service.",
  "Frith spoke Spanish with a slight accent, which he attributed to his mixed upbringing, having been born in Ecuador to an Ecuadorian mother and a father from New Zealand.",
  "He wrote reports to Moscow on a specially-encrypted laptop, and copied them on a secure USB key that he deposited in what the services call “dead letter boxes” in Spain.",
  "Western intelligence services are also concerned that one or more “illegals” could, unbeknownst to them, build a career inside government or international institutions.",
  "I know this is a shock and I’m sorry that I have to do this on the street but it was the only way I could get to talk to you securely.”\n\nCherepanov denied everything.",
  "Like Valdezate, Moreno said he has spent the intervening years mulling what might have happened to Frith, including dark scenarios about his past and disappearance.",
  "A Russian diplomat in Madrid declined to comment for this story and the Russian government, reached through the embassy, didn’t reply to a set of emailed questions.",
  "And with the deterioration of its relations with the West, Moscow has been deprived of a trove of information it could previously obtain through regular channels.",
  "Frith even had to put his own money into the business at times, withdrawing cash from a safe he kept in a branch of Santander, the big Spanish bank, Moreno said.",
  "According to a source, Spanish authorities may have exerted discreet pressure on Moreno’s associates, unsure whether he knew what his partner did in reality.",
  "An added complication, according to the European diplomat, is that “some EU countries still have some difficulty considering that Russia is indeed a threat.",
  "When first contacted a few weeks ago by email to discuss Frith’s disappearance, he replied that he “couldn’t help” and “had nothing to say” on the matter.",
  "Showing that counterespionage services are aware of their activities, these sources say, might induce some to become double agents or give themselves up.",
  "“Our business is based on a simple structure but with the necessary background to allow us to deal with any type of plan,” the firm’s website proclaimed.",
  "The former head of a European counterintelligence service explained why counterintelligence services seldom publicize the cases of illegals they unmask.",
