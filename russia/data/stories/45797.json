  "If Westworld is a show about evolving consciousness, then our hero is probably Bernard, a man with one foot in each reality, a host who’s played his part in controlling the other hosts and is now fighting to stay on the right side of survival.",
  "As Maeve and Dolores cut a bloody swathe through the park, Bernard linked up with Charlotte (Tessa Thompson), the executive director of Westworld’s board, in her quest to extract the departed Ford’s secrets of robot consciousness.",
  "I rolled my eyes at Dolores hanging the well-dressed tourists from Westworld’s board and spitting some of the show’s iconic lines at the camera (“Doesn’t look like anything to me,” she snarked as they pleaded for mercy).",
  "That’s partly because Wright is such a magnetic actor (even when he’s playing a brain-damaged robot), and partly because Charlotte’s aims are as opaque as the white, gluey golem she has serving her in her secret lab.",
  "As the humans blubbered and begged for their lives, the bots turned them into target practice, used their corpses to set up ambushes to create more corpses, and hanged them only after the slow torment of a monologue.",
  "The other main plotline of “Journey Into Night” saw William (Ed Harris), the black-hatted human outlaw, quest through the park until he found Ford’s creepy little robot in search of an info-dump.",
  "There’s real malevolence to her, not the passive sort of cruelty that ran roughshod over Season 1, and her creepy automaton manservant was one of the few genuine jolts I got from this episode.",
  "It’s a bit of drama that won’t stay interesting for long, especially if characters like Dolores, the square-jawed Teddy (James Marsden), and Maeve are the protagonists we’re rooting for.",
  "I was slightly more appreciative of Maeve making the sniveling Lee (Simon Quarterman) strip in front of her, but in the end the visual gag is the same—the roles have been reversed.",
  "Spencer, as I welcome you to this weekly discussion, I have to ask: Do these violent delights really have any particular end in mind?",
  "For the most part, though, this felt like a regular old entry of Westworld, as much as the order of things has been totally upended.",
  "Maeve took a lighter touch, but she was still in the wrathful mode when she made Lee Sizemore strip for her schadenfreude.",
  "I think that’s left ambiguous, for now, but there were moments of nastiness that ultimately just felt too glib to me.",
  "Dolores and her newly hostile hosts staged less a revolution than an Old Testament reckoning, or ISIS assault.",
  "Spencer Kornhaber: The answer to your question is right there in the secret code you’re quoting.",
  "More questions, a tease of a new game for him to play, and a whole lot of circular language.",
  "Of the main plotlines in “Journey Into Night,” this one grabbed me the most.",
  "Which are also, this being the season premiere, violent beginnings.",
  "It’s as open-ended as that tiger that’s washed up onto the beach.",
  "The hosts are confronting humanity with their own inhumanity.",
  "These violent delights really do have have violent ends.",
  "Not just violent, either: sadistic.",
  "But I’m not sure that they are.",
  "What did he get instead?"
