  "The main feature of an economy driven by computing and networks is increasing returns to scale: powerful positive feedback loops that make it easy for any company that’s racing ahead on a given market to eventually take most of that market, in what resembles a natural monopoly.",
  "For companies, this has a transformative consequence: it is now easy to orchestrate interactions between Internet users, to collect data at a large scale, and to harness that power vested in billions of individuals using networked applications on a day-to-day basis.",
  "And so, following the model of a presidential campaign, this is what it takes for startup founders to succeed: they need to be very ambitious, to be driven by a mission, to organize a community of engaged users and to take bold risks all along the way.",
  "For instance, Uber has been an activist for convenient end-to-end transportation in cities, but they ended up alienating customers on other fronts, notably how the company treated women and how drivers were treated on the platform.",
  "There’s more and more computing power in the world, and it’s now ubiquitous, found not only in personal computers and smartphones but also pooled by large cloud computing platforms and embedded in basically every device.",
  "The idea has been floating around for quite some time that growing a startup is very similar to running for President in the U.S. Or, as the New York Times once wrote, “a presidential campaign is the ultimate startup”.",
  "Ultimately, winning the election is like discovering a business model in Steve Blank’s famous definition of a startup: the organization ceases to be a startup and it’s time to face new challenges.",
  "As we’re going through a shift from the Fordist age to the Entrepreneurial Age, today’s dominant companies are very different from the ones that dominated in the twentieth century.",
  "When a tech company inspires trust, it can collect more and more personal data from users, which lets it further refine the user experience and thus inspire even more trust.",
  "Because it’s about winning a race with only one winner, you need to approach growing your company like it’s a political campaign—and activism is your best weapon.",
  "But in the process of pursuing this mission, it became possible for organizations like Cambridge Analytica to distort public discourse and to corrupt democracy.",
  "A company can only be activist to the extent that it doesn’t alienate their users and betray the trust that is so critical for a tech company to sustain growth.",
  "Only that which generates superior increasing returns is certain to crush the competition and realize a sizable return on investment over the long term.",
  "They had to take radical measures, including replacing their CEO, to solve many problems on those fronts so as to stop losing the trust of their users.",
  "Activism is essential to initiate that virtuous circle, but if it leads into an eventual loss of trust, the virtuous can become a vicious cycle.",
  "That being said, there are limits to that approach, and those limits are brought forward by the individuals using a company’s application.",
  "Again, it’s just like in a presidential campaign: the candidates who lose the race tend to be only footnotes in history books.",

  "This activist approach to growing startups and turning them into tech companies is not only a marketing trick.",
  "In an economy driven by computing and networks, there’s no room for a Ford and a Chrysler right behind a GM.",
  "And so, despite the activism, Facebook is losing the trust of its users and it's now an endangered company.",
  "Thus activism must be considered within the broad picture of how business works in the Entrepreneurial Age.",
  "It delivers exceptional experience at scale, generating network effects and winner-takes-most outcomes.",
  "In the Entrepreneurial Age, there’s no room on a given market for two or three dominant companies.",
  "The Entrepreneurial Age is driven by two general-purpose technologies: computing and networks.",
  "But when overreaching activism harms trust, things start moving in the opposite direction.",
  "Then it strikes a chord with early adopters who like the first version of the product.",
  "Then it has to raise a lot of money in order to scale up to cover the entire nation.",
