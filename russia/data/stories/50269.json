  "Last month Vera Jourova, the European Union’s commissioner for justice and consumers, warned that it needed to amend its ‘misleading’ terms of service to make clearer how it uses personal data—or face sanctions.” Setting aside the issue of compliance costs, which might hit smaller (non-exempted) firms harder, don’t we expect most of the enforcement action to be aimed at big platforms such as Facebook and Google?",
  "As Brookman explains, in spite of the FTC’s existing authority and the 2011 consent decree, Facebook tracks what its users and non-users do on other websites and apps without their knowledge or permission; shares users’ private profile data with hardware manufacturers without any transparency; and shares personal data with third-party apps even after offering a control to turn it off.",
  "But the Justices are rebuffing Neil’s argument, saying “Well sure, even if our data is out there, we still should enjoy some semblance of autonomy, and just because data is observabledoes not mean there should be a free-for-all with no individual rights.” I think that’s absolutely right, but we need to translate those concepts to the commercial privacy space.",
  "If they wanted to make an explicit value proposition for harvesting off-Facebook data—that is, what I do on ESPN, New York Times, or Angry Bird by virtue of Facebook serving a pixel on those services—for better ad targeting, good luck with that (though again, if the choice punished users for rejecting it, you run into the competition issue).",
  "Brookman: I would posit it’s not a fair choice to say to someone, “Use Facebook or not (the only network that your family and friends all use), and accept all the opaque data practices that come with it.”\n\nBeggs: I agree mainly because the monopoly nature of Facebook breaks the simplistic efficiency argument in a number of ways.",
  "Furthermore, what people would be willing to pay to maintain their privacy and what they would have to be paid to give up their privacy generally result in very different valuations (due to the endowment effect, among other things), and it’s not clear which is the appropriate one to use in a cost-benefit analysis.",
  "Singer: This issue of the FTC’s penalty authority came up recently in a deception case involving “Made in the USA” claims, in which certain Commissioners argued that the FTC cannot seek redress unless the agency can show that the companies charged more money because of the fraud they committed.",
  "In a new paper published by the International Association of Privacy Professionals, Justin Brookman, Director of Consumer Privacy and Technology Policy for Consumers Union, argues that that the FTC’s current powers are not sufficient to keep up with a modern tech platform’s data practices.",
  "Singer: Justin’s piece also argues that FTC “needs privacy authority that extends beyond deception or murky unfairness to accord companies’ data practices with consumer preferences and reasonable expectations.” What kinds of conduct are not captured under a deception/unfairness standard?",
  "Brookman: Today, the FTC can get civil penalties in a small subset of its cases—for example, if someone violates one of their industry-specific statutes (COPPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act) or someone violates a consent order (meaning they previously got busted for violating Section 5).",
  "While mandating transparency (and actually enforcing such transparency in a practical sense) is a pretty clear win since it allows consumers to make better decisions, mandating what information can be collected is in effect telling me as a consumer what data I am allowed to sell.",
  "Yet voters’ appetite for privacy protection is strong: A recent Pew survey found that just nine percent of social media users were “very confident” that social media companies would protect their data, and two-thirds said current laws are not adequate to protect privacy.",
  "I think one central problem is that a complex system, perhaps one that is psychologically costly to navigate, can “work” for someone who is an economic robot (I’m fine with the settings, whatever), but they are absurd from the perspective of a normal sane human person.",
  "Singer: (stepping out of moderator role for the last time, promise) The Economist had a piece in April rebutting this innovation point: “Opponents of privacy legislation have long argued that the imposition of rules would keep technology companies from innovating.",
  "Brookman: I think that the notion that privacy protections will entrench Google and Facebook is belied by the fact that Google and Facebook have consistently lobbied aggressively against nearly all proposed privacy legislation in both the United States and Europe.",
  "Brookman: While I think the FTC could be more aggressive (e.g., demanding more remedies in Made in the USA cases, I think there’s more they could do with FB order), I think they’re by and large doing a good job with very limited resources and legal authority.",
  "So most companies get caught breaking Section 5 (already a relatively small chance of enforcement given relative size of agency), there’s no immediate consequence, just a possible PR hit, legal fees, and a possibility of significant consequences next time.",
  "Among other things, GDPR gives consumers the right to transfer their data to another firm; requires companies to define how they keep data secure; and lets regulators levy fines (up to four percent of worldwide annual revenues) if firms break the rules.",
  "Beggs: My impression is that people in an abstract sense don’t like feeling like they’re being watched, but I’m very curious as to whether they can (a) state their concerns more concretely, and (b) put their money where their mouths are in this context.",
  "So the order doesn’t really get to the core of Facebook’s dubious privacy behaviors—tracking what you do on other websites and apps, tracking geolocation even when you’re not using the app, and targeting you based on what you buy in the physical world.",
  "Neil, in your forthcoming privacy piece, you advocate for “case-by-case enforcement frameworks where company practices are judged based on consumer outcomes.” Why do you think ex post enforcement is superior to general rule-making authority here?",
  "A case-by-case approach allows the regulatory body to address bad actors without attempting to design practices for an entire industry, and it enables the law to evolve alongside the technology in a much more organic, common-law-like fashion.",
  "And of course, the FTC needs a ton more staff and stronger tools—penalty authority so violations aren’t consequence-free, and rulemaking to offer clarity to the marketplace about how the law applies to new technologies and business models.",
  "Singer: Justin, you argue that the FTC should be given the ability to obtain civil penalties for privacy violations (and for all violations of Section 5 for that matter), and that the penalty authority should not be subject to a cap.",
  "Brookman: Absent civil penalties, at the very least, the FTC should be demanding disgorgement of ill-gotten gains when they settle a case—that is, if the company made money ripping people off, they shouldn't be allowed to keep that!",
  "Certainly, if a company’s business model is predicated entirely on bad privacy practices, then privacy legislation will especially impact them, and will probably disadvantage them more compared to companies like Google and Facebook.",
  "The Federal Trade Commission has brought actions against both companies for privacy violations, though due to weaknesses in the law and the limitations in its own authority, its actions have not sufficiently deterred their abuses.",
  "Brookman: If someone is really fine with Google tracking them all over the web, and Google is not coercing that consent based on factors where they’re insulated from competition, then I’m fine with Google getting that consent.",
  "Pursuant to those powers, in 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) secured a 20-year consent order against Facebook, under which Facebook agreed to obtain consent from its users before sharing their data with third parties.",
  "To the extent that the GDPR didn’t actually force companies to stop collecting information and instead mainly mandated disclosure, you could proxy for consumer benefit by looking at how many people refused the GDPR agreement.",
  "Brookman: I think there’s value to what Neil says, but there's also a cost to that approach as well --- the FTC is prohibited from using another tool to more clearly delineate reliable norms regarding a certain practice.",
  "pollution) are categorized as market failures, and there is strong economic justification for using policy to force the companies that produce the externalities to internalize the costs they are imposing on their users.",
  "I’m not convinced that nudging people into protecting their privacy fits this paradigm, unless you think that their lizard brains are simply too lazy to go through the settings, which I guess could be true.",
  "Brookman: I don’t think it’s necessary to force people to articulate their concerns concretely, but I do think the money-mouth question is valid—that is, how much do they value it compared to other things.",
  "Brookman: I mean, many of the basic concepts in there are pretty standard suggestions for privacy law—more meaningful control/data minimization, better transparency, access and portability, security, etc.",
  "Companies blandly reserve the right to share data with partners, but there’s no specificity on what’s actually going on, and I suspect actual practices are much more constrained — and possibly even good!",
  "To answer those questions, we invited the Consumer Union’s Justin Brookman, Neil Chilson of the Charles Koch Institute (and former Chief Technologist at the FTC), and fellow Bytes contributor Jodi Beggs.",
  "Beggs: When companies such as Facebook breach users’ privacy without proper compensation, they are essentially imposing a negative externality on the market for...well whatever it is Facebook produces.",
  "This mechanism is problematic when it comes to companies like Facebook both because users don’t pay to use Facebook and because Facebook did not make the privacy practices transparent to the consumer.",
  "The data here are a bit mixed, as Google’s \"website reach\" (the number of websites that contain each ad vendor's trackers) is up (by 0.9 percent) but Facebook’s website reach is down (by 6.7 percent).",
  "Singer: Some very important people on Twitter, such as Open Market’s Matt Stoller, claim that the problem with the FTC isn’t lack of tools, but instead, a lack of desire to enforce the law in general.",
  "I think people have been hesitant to put rules in place for big tech companies, but that sentiment has radically shifted in the last couple of years as some of their warts have become visible to all.",
  "Chilson: Let me add another plus for case-by-case: Case-by-case is a more permissionless environment, which enables a wider range of potential innovations, including completely unforeseen approaches.",
  "Although Facebook could, in theory, face penalties of up to $40,000 per user per day for violating the FTC’s consent order, the mere threat of fines might not meaningfully deter Facebook’s behavior.",
  "I’m interested to see what an informed marketplace might look like, though with regard to services insulated from competition by network effects, market pressures aren't going to be as effective.",
  "If consumers fret about what smartphone apps may do with their data, fewer new offerings will take off—especially in artificial intelligence.” Too little regs, and innovation can start to fall.",
  "Chilson: But I’ll add that, as mentioned earlier, my browsing history is completely worthless until combined and aggregated with many others to create an ad product that can fund free services.",
  "And my argument earlier was that the info Justin seems most worried about, the tracking information that enables targeted advertising, has zero (or near zero) value to the individual consumer.",
  "And the contradiction comes, Hal, in the part where someone can’t be bothered to do something that they supposedly really care about, but I guess that can be said of other nudge contexts.",
  "Would wrapping privacy into a larger bill—say, one that empowered the FTC to police discriminatory conduct by tech platforms—enhance or detract from its likelihood of legislative success?",
  "Both companies have problematic practices that should be addressed by privacy rules, but both also have core products that can be monetized effectively without compromising user privacy.",
  "And that VC study funded by Google and Facebook that ignores the post-enactment data that shows no dip in funding and looks instead at just four months where investment also dips in US?",
  "As a trivial example, if I value my privacy at $5 and a company can make $8 of profit from my data, it’s probably going to charge me an extra $8 for the product if it can’t use my data.",
  "Beggs: “Harm” is a weird standard here, since if someone values their privacy then a breach of their privacy is by definition harm, but this isn’t really the legal definition of harm.",
  "And even if there are, why couldn’t a small firm—that isn’t already exempted from the law—outsource its compliance work to a third-party that could exploit those alleged economies?",
  "However, because those companies’ business models are also heavily reliant on the use of personal information, privacy law does impact them directly—and more than most companies.",
  "Beggs: What’s kind of interesting is that we focus on the harm to the Facebook user from collecting off-platform data, but we never talk about how, say, ESPN feels on the matter.",
  "To be clear, I’m all for like 100 blinking signs alerting users as to what data is being collected on them, but I see that as a separate issue from nudges via default settings.",
  "Chilson: If we are going to do property rights in data (and I think that metaphor has problems), I think the Coasian answer could be that the rights should be with the company.",
  "My paper lays out the many tools for privacy protection, from technology to social norms to private contract to torts to state AGs and sectoral laws enforced by other agencies.",
  "Neil Chilson: I’d note that I got ripped on Twitter for calling these things “audits.” They’re technically “assessments.”\n\nSinger: I’ve been ripped on Twitter for much less.",
  "Privacy policies should be more like SEC filings that aren’t read by everybody, but are translated to the market through the people who study those things for a living (me).",
  "Chilson: Demanding seclusion while interacting with machines on the other side of the planet is as misguided as demanding to be secluded while walking down Fifth Avenue.",
  "Brookman: That is a question we don’t know the answer to, because exercising agency over privacy (or this bundle of interests/economic goods) is extremely challenging.",
  "Indeed, there are good reasons to think that there are social problems, such as in health care, where free-rider problems mean consumers don’t contribute enough data.",
  "Opponents of GDPR-type protections warn that, due to larger firms’ ability to absorb regulatory compliance costs, GDRP will solidify the dominant platform’s position.",
  "Should I have no agency with regard to my privacy unless I can convince Neil of some objective harm?Other privacy laws aren’t predicated on this novel harms analysis.",
  "Beggs: The costs are easier to quantify in that they are largely the costs of compliance and whatever lost profits there are as a result of changing business models.",
  "Brookman: Their present self is like “I wish I understood what was going on but I don’t really have the bandwidth to deal right now.”\n\nBeggs: I’ll buy that I guess.",
  "Some grocery stores even have a direct feed of their scanner data to these companies, so I have some bad news for you about data collection in a historical context.",
  "In the Made in the USA cases, the FTC said they weren’t going to demand money unless people paid more money for products fraudulently described as Made in the USA.",
  "The FTC could theoretically try to address that under general Section 5 authority, but they haven’t tried and it’s unclear if they would be successful if they did.",
  "Brookman: First, a new law should by default limit data collection, retention, and sharing to what’s reasonably necessary for a service requested by the consumer.",
  "I heard similar arguments that adoption of Do Not Track would favor those companies; again, however, both fought hard to stop industry adherence to that standard.",
  "Beggs: (*whispers* defaults ARE nudges) In general, nudges work well for things that we know we should do but that our lizard brains really don’t feel like doing.",
  "And I shouldn't expect that Facebook and Google drones in the store will be monitoring my purchases either (even though they have the technical ability to do so).",
  "Brookman: GDPR is not predictable, but much of that goes to uncertainty about whether European data protection authorities (DPAs) will enforce as written or not!",
  "Beggs: I do think there are a decent number of apps where tracking is basically their entire business model, but it’s not the product they provide to consumers.",
  "That’s a real harm, a real challenge, and worthy of our attention, but it has almost nothing to do with the types of data that Facebook, for example, collects.",
  "Others have called for an independent tribunal to adjudicate privacy disputes between users and websites, where users would have a new private right of action.",
  "Beggs: One simple thing holding up legislation from both a practical and political perspective is that the costs seem far more quantifiable than the benefits.",
  "Beggs: I was thinking more of the hedge funds counting the cars in the mall parking lots, since neither the customer nor Bloomingdale’s is consenting to that.",
  "Chilson: As I explain in my new piece, preventing consumer injury is the proper goal of privacy legislation, and legislation should directly pursue that goal.",
  "The benefit side is far harder to quantify since it depends crucially on how much consumers enjoy having the agency and/or privacy that the GDPR affords them.",
  "Jodi Beggs: I’m all about words meaning things, but I also notice that people argue over word choice when they don’t have more substantive arguments to make.",
  "Singer: Jodi, How would an economist go about measuring the benefits and costs and GDPR with the benefit of hindsight—namely, six months of implementation?",
  "Permissioned approaches narrow innovation options, often requiring innovators to fit a new service into a pre-existing framework and established processes.",
  "And some legislation is inevitable within the next 5-10 years because “increasingly, all data collection is technologically possible” point I made earlier.",
  "Brookman: I think if you suggested to the average user that everything they did online should be observable by everyone else in the world, they might balk.",
  "But I don't think many VC's are going to buy the argument, \"Invest in this small company, don't worry, the EU Data Protection Authorities won't sue you.\"",
  "Ideally, we wouldn't have to rely on third-party statements, but not everything is testable in our labs (what happens to data in the cloud for example).",
  "Generally, in the data security area I think there is a better case for ex ante rules, because more people agree on what a good world looks like there.",
  "But that misses the point of disgorgement, which is that wrongdoers should not be able to profit from wrongdoing (whether consumers paid more or not)!",
  "And because GDPR fines are tied to a company’s revenues, European regulators in search of cash (or headlines) will likely target the larger platforms.",
  "Google’s also said from time to time that they have privacy enhancing technologies in place to ameliorate the privacy issues with certain practices.",
  "Singer: Justin, you also advocate for more detailed disclosures by online platforms, so that outsiders can meaningfully assess Facebook’s practices.",
  "Chilson: Most of the data that Justin and others seem to be concerned about is data that is jointly created by the interaction between two entities.",
  "Google uses Android devices to build out maps based on WiFi triangulation, but they claim not to be maintaining precise location history for users.",
  "Chilson: I think most of the worthwhile things that GDPR does, the U.S. approach already does, but in a different way and with a lot less baggage.",
  "The agency directly returned nearly $400 million in refunds and supported the refund of $6 billion to consumers in the year ending June 30, 2017.",
  "Another is that regimes that mandate consent benefit known and big companies because brand recognition might get a consumer over the opt in hump.",
  "Beggs: If people were so stressed about their privacy in an immediate sense, why would they then have to be nudged into protecting their privacy?",
  "Or they have a system in place to measure how effective online ads are in translating into offline purchases without tracking individual users.",
  "We’re trying to evaluate and rate products based on privacy and security, and a big piece of that work is looking at companies’ disclosures.",
  "I have no reason to think that this is automatically a desirable outcome—maybe it is, but I’d need additional information to be convinced.",
  "If I were to try to make a case for GDPR differentially affecting smaller firms, it would be because there is a fixed cost of compliance.",
  "In most policy situations we should be able to do better than bluntly banning an activity, so I’m generally skeptical of such approaches.",
  "Singer: Ok, here’s is a question for the whole panel: What parts of GDPR, if any, should be incorporated into a U.S. federal privacy law?",
  "As a result, Google and Facebook (and the vast majority of the ad tech industry) ignore users’ browser Do Not Track signals to this day.",
  "The Chat was moderated by Hal Singer, editor of Washington Bytes and Senior Fellow of the George Washington Institute of Public Policy.",
  "Brookman: But the value in preserving seclusion—the value in being left alone and hiding personal information from others—is not zero.",
  "In any event, why would a mandatory change, in say the default settings, impose greater costs on small websites than on larger sites?",
  "But I don't think they have the ability to exercise that choice today, especially with regard to services insulated from competition.",
  "Beggs: They have the ability to implicitly exercise the choice, but it’s tied to the choice of whether to use the underlying product.",
  "Chilson: Sure, there are trade offs, and again, I think ultimately it goes back to how you feel about the current state of the world.",
  "In that sense, such regulation would be telling me that I can't sell personal information in the same way that I can’t sell a kidney.",
  "Do you agree with those Commissioners that the FTC does not have the authority to issue monetary penalties for deception on its own?",
  "Brookman: As far as relative losses, yes if someone’s business is just hidden, third-party tracking, yes, it will be worse for them!",
  "Singer: In May 2018, the Europeans recently embraced a form of privacy regulation called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",
  "I say “Demanding seclusion while making a purchase in the middle of Bloomingdale’s” is a better analogy, but the point is the same.",
  "I know a lot of major publishers are certainly upset about being beholden to Facebook and Google (bwah, that’s Jason Kint’s music).",
  "Facebook is going to maximize value for its shareholders (and for its officers whose remuneration is heavily based on share price).",
  "There needs to be some sort of “reasonable person” standard for such systems similar to that in truth-in-advertising laws and such.",
  "Chilson: Justin has essentially defined the problem as “Facebook collects too much data.” Granted, Facebook collects a lot of data.",
  "* * *\n\nHal Singer: Justin, What it is about the FTC’s consent decree with Facebook that makes it “incredibly narrow” in your view?",
  "But its broadest authority rests on policing acts of deception or unfairness, a nebulous concept in all realms, including privacy.",
  "Brookman: There’s an interest or an “economic good”—that is, the value that privacy law would enable people to protect and retain.",
  "If Facebook is making it so ESPN can’t sell ESPN’s on-platform data, that’s a garbage but not a terribly sympathy-generating move.",
  "Chilson: I’d just point out that there is a legal difference between redress, which the FTC absolutely can get in deception cases.",
  "Chilson: There is a big, big difference between my rights vis-a-vis the government and my rights vis-a-vis another private party.",
  "Justin appears to think large chunks of Facebook’s business model (the parts that help it compete with Google) should be illegal.",
  "As to Stoller’s argument about under-enforcement, the U.S. has and has long had the most active privacy enforcement in the world.",
  "Indeed, according to The Economist, Facebook “had already started to feel the force of the GDPR, which went into effect in May.",
  "Singer: Neil, your future self wants to be muscular, clean-shaven, and doesn't want your tweets to be available for all to see.",
  "Singer: Well their future self cares a lot about it, but their present self says, “I can’t be bothered.” Kinda like exercising.",
  "Normally, if a consumer knew that a product had a privacy issue, it would simply lower her willingness to pay for the product.",
  "Wiretap laws aren't interpreted to assess whether I am harmed by someone reading my communications before finding a violation!",
  "Under the current regime, we have enterprise-grade communications services available to consumers for no money out of pocket.",
  "There, we “nudged” employees into socking away more for retirement by making participation in the plan the default selection.",
  "Stop the payments!” then you can try to estimate a benefit, though even then that benefit might not be the full $5 per month.",
  "Beggs: I think the point is that simply making the consumers whole once they complain doesn’t have a strong deterrent effect.",
  "If I’m then like, “Nah whatever it's fine, just let them continue,” then the disclosure hasn’t really benefited me directly.",
  "Franklin Foer has called for the creation of a new agency, the Data Protection Authority, to secure the sanctity of privacy.",
  "Then he is forced to inform me that this transfer is happening for some reason and I have the ability to stop the payments.",
  "But today, Google isn’t actually required to write any of that down, so it's hard to know what is happening under the hood.",
  "If we care about efficiency, we might ask who can extract the most value from that information and assign the rights there.",
  "Today, most privacy policies are pretty empty—they’re designed to evade liability, not provide the market with information.",
  "Seems like the threat of financial penalties plus third-party audits should do something to curb Facebook’s worst impulses.",
  "This narrowing does the greatest harm in fields where innovation would otherwise be rapid, unpredictable, and disruptive.",
  "One thing I think about a lot is whether anyone sees the GDPR notices and is like “Nope, I’m out” and stops using a site.",
  "Some reporters, like David Dayen, suggest that Senator Schumer is too close to Facebook (Schumer’s daughter works there).",
  "Also Bloomingdale’s absolutely shares retail data with IRI and other retail data providers and has for basically forever.",
  "COPPA (the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) rules are predictable though (given rulemaking and extensive FAQs).",
  "The order basically says that Facebook (1) can’t lie about privacy and (2) can’t offer privacy controls that don’t work.",
  "Beggs: I’d object to this characterization if not for the fact that Thaler is literally a member of that club nowadays.",
  "Chilson: Yeah, and I don’t understand why you want to define, in law, that the Facebook platform is what, facebook.com?",
  "Detailed legislation requires regulators to predict the future, else they risk a mismatch between the law and reality.",
  "I study privacy controls for a living and I find Facebook's privacy controls to be incredibly confusing and Byzantine.",
  "For me, I would keep Facebook's data collection by default limited to on-Facebook data—that is, what I do on Facebook.",
  "What guarantee is there that the FTC would reach into its newly designed toolkit and go after a firm such as Facebook?",
  "Is there a way to design the new rules such that enforcement levels wouldn’t change given a change in administration?",
  "Technologically, we rely more and more on third-party services and everything about it is technologically observable.",
  "Beggs: Companies collect retail data and sell it, and somehow this has never sparked outrage before as far as I know.",
  "Arguably, the fake Made in the USA manufacturers should have refunded people, or notified and made refunds available.",
  "Also, I don’t think requiring companies to ignore what they learn about how to serve their customers is a good idea.",
  "If you buy a CD or iTunes download, it’s reported to Nielsen SoundScan, etc., along with some information about you.",
  "Brookman: I mean, some of that might be captured by deception/unfairness, but a clear standard would be preferable!",
  "If this fixed cost is large enough, I guess it could push smaller but not larger firms into unprofitable territory.",
  "I agree that most normal users aren’t going to read, let alone understand, the fine print of an online disclosure.",
  "How do stringent disclosure policies “introduce meaningful accountability” for the behaviors of online platforms?",
  "(Rights don’t change the efficient outcome in many cases, as per Coase, but they determine who gets compensated.)",
  "Users don’t know how their data is going to be exploited or can’t be bothered with changing the default settings.",
  "Beggs: I don’t see how the brand argument is anything above and beyond existing network effects and such though.",
  "Chilson: The thing about information is, like many resources, it has different value depending on who holds it.",
  "Chilson: I think what’s holding it up is the extreme difference in visions for what the world should look like.",
  "Brookman: Any federal legislation is hard to pass these days, all the more so with a divided Congress in 2019.",
  "But what it the practical utility in having regulators, academics, and Consumer Reports review the fine print?",
  "Brookman: Neil’s point on permissionless-ness is right but also so vague and axiomatic as to be kinda useless.",
  "Chilson: The nudge argument relies on the assumption that consumers make the economically inefficient choice.",
  "Brookman: Ex ante rules can also provide more predictability to the marketplace, for companies and consumers.",
  "Beggs: I feel like that is still an open question from a philosophical perspective, that’s kind of the issue.",
  "Chilson: I just don’t understand walking the public streets of the Internet and demanding that no one watch.",
  "Far be it from me to tell someone they can’t share their life with the world and every #brand on the planet.",
  "Beggs: Rights have to be assigned in some way in order to bargain efficiently from a logistical perspective.",
  "Liability should require showing actual or likely consumer injury, with material deception as per se injury.",
  "Does the FTC need a new toolkit to police Facebook in particular and protect our online privacy generally?",
  "Emailing everyone privacy policies and flashing a cookie banner on every page is not Mission Accomplished.",
  "The last effort to enact privacy protection, the 2012 Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, also went nowhere.",
  "Singer: Neil, you know that case-by-case is my solution to net neutrality and the tech platform problems.",
  "The unpredictability is why companies have to spend so much on lawyers to help mitigate their legal risk.",
  "Chilson: The main reason case-by-case is good is because it mitigates the regulator’s knowledge problem.",
  "Brookman: Consumers reasonably expect that they’re sharing data with Facebook when they're on Facebook!",
  "Chilson: There are certainly some areas where Congress has determined that ex ante rules are necessary.",
  "What are the costs that have been imposed on consumers that the current approach has failed to protect?",
  "Beggs: My point is that data has been collected for forever, so, to paraphrase Legally Blonde, Why now?",
  "If liability hinges on injury, many of the other details of privacy legislation become less important.",
  "The Cambridge Analytica saga produced a drama-filled Congressional hearing but no privacy legislation.",
  "Beggs: I think the overly simplistic logic is that more established firms have higher profit margins.",
  "Singer: Hell is being trapped in a philosophical chat with this libertarian crew—and finding no exit.",
  "Chilson: To me, that complexity is why regulating the means of collecting data is often problematic.",
  "Brookman: Sure, at least from my firm’s (Consumer Reports) perspective, it’s pretty straightforward.",
  "But the substantive limits imposed by the order are flimsy, and the audit is just pro forma theater.",
  "Chilson: That insight about more data collection becoming technologically possible mirrors my paper!",
  "Consumers who recognize and respect a brand are more likely to jump through hoops to get a service.",
  "Regulators don’t need to think in abstract hypotheticals but examine the incident in front of them.",
  "Chilson: If we test by outcomes—that is, whether the consumer is harmed—that’s extremely knowable.",
  "Brookman: That’s great, though we just need to come to agreement about what the tools/rights are.",
  "They collect a ton of data, in a bunch of different ways, but we’re not really sure why and how.",
  "If this proportion is really low, then I’m not convinced that the GDPR really changes anything.",
  "Put differently, how would we know the Europeans have succeeded in solving the privacy problem?",
  "Because there is a huge body of empirical work that suggests most people don't value it much.",
  "And I think most of those are more appropriately labeled “data security” rather than privacy.",
  "Brookman: If I’m on ESPN, I don’t expect that everyone else is hanging out there watching me!",
  "Effective privacy law should not simply mandate expensive processes and compliance programs.",
  "Singer: And those things aren’t already captured by the FTC’s deception/unfairness standard?",
  "Singer: So if you reject Justin’s reasonably necessary standard, what would you use instead?",
  "It’s becoming less so, but it’s still the case that I have some degree of anonymity online.",
  "But maybe I shouldn’t expect that Bloomingdale's will share with Acxiom (the data broker).",
  "If we can’t win the technology war, we need legal tools/rights to turn off the panopticon.",
  "I have a new paper that explains what to consider when thinking about federal legislation.",
  "Facebook collects a lot of data about me when I use their service, and I’m fine with that!",
  "Brookman: As Jodi noted, a lot of the data collection that’s happening is not transparent.",
  "The FTC enforces many privacy laws, several of which provide narrow rulemaking authority.",
  "On the one hand …\n\nChilson: I think we have to unpack “privacy.” It’s too vague a term.",
