  "DICKERSON: And, Ben, it is possible that there could be both a special counsel inquiry that is legitimate and the could be these other questions that the White House has been raising this week, one of the them the fact that this dossier of information about the president, a lot of it unconfirmed, a lot of it very unconfirmed if that's a category, that it was funded in part by the DNC and the Clinton campaign.",
  "And it -- I have to say, all of this, the dossier, the uranium, the attack on Mueller seems to me to be a just absolutely frantic effort to distract attention from what we do know, which is the intel -- as David really importantly pointed out, the intelligence community concluded that Russia tried to meddle in the election, it's included that Russia tried to meddle in the election on Donald Trump's behalf.",
  "So the distribution tables are going to be a little bit of a deja vu all over again to the impact on health care and what would happen to premiums because they're going -- they very well could end up looking like wealthy people get a huge tax break and there's going to be a bunch of middle income people, depending on what they do, who could end up suffering.",
  "(HUMMING MELODY)\n\nBATISTE: So, for me, I like to keep that essence and then let my self-conscience mind go, free association with things that I'm listening to at the time, something that I may have been working on several years back will come up and there's no intention other than just to, you know, follow that stream of consciousness.",
  "When our secretary of state is sitting down with a partner that matters most, China, trying to negotiate something that would resolve and keep us from going into military conflict with North Korea, which brings in South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, and he's knee-capped by the president, it hurts our nation.",
  "The other has been the Intelligence Committee's evaluation of the extent of Russian meddling in the last election and to try to, along with the independent counsel, answer the question of whether or not there was any collusion between members of President Trump's campaign team and the Russians.",
  "And then, when we start exhibiting some of those same tendencies, it creates an air that leads again, more fully towards conflict, where what we need to be doing is supporting the efforts that Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis, who is involved in this diplomacy, are carrying out.",
  "And he's -- I think, you know, just a couple of week ago we saw Mitch McConnell visit the White House and then whether he was -- knew ahead of time that he'd be dragged into the Rose Garden but stood there as Trump went on and on and sort of parried (ph) with reporters.",
  "And we are now working on another $25 million campaign just in New Jersey for advertising to young people to talk to them about the dangers of prescription drugs and why even if it's given to you by a doctor doesn't mean it's good for you, it doesn't mean it's safe.",
  "DICKERSON: When -- one of the things the president said that -- in fact, he said it was most important part of what he was proposing, was a massive advertising campaign to get people, he said especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.",
  "Instead -- instead -- instead you face a situation where the fact is that Jeff Flake gave an interview right after he gave his speak where he said, you know, when I came here, I wanted to talk about limited government and free trade and things like that.",
  "Or, basically, you're getting rid of credits, deductions, the kind of things that have been in our code for years which makes it so complex, if you will, for people to fill out their income forms, but also things that really don't move our economy along.",
  "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS NEWS: Today on FACE THE NATION: The divisions between Republicans on the Hill and the president grow, as Washington braces for the opening of a sealed indictment stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.",
  "How much of the dossier's creation they paid for, we have less of a clear picture of, in part because of this deal that was cut on behalf of Fusion GPS with the House Intel Committee with --\n\nDICKERSON: The authors of the dossier, I should say.",
  "DOMENECH: That -- this is the problem that they run into because the -- Republican senators, many of them would like to have a different constituency than the one they actually have, but you cannot dissolve the people and elect another.",
  "And, you know, once again, it just comes down, now we're nine months into this process, since he's been president, where the president still does not talk about fundamentally how Russia has potentially affected the democracy.",
  "DICKERSON: Senator Flake would say that there is some responsibility, though, even while you're trying to get things done, to call out those things that the president does that might get in the way of you getting things done.",
  "And if the special counsel feels now, along with a grand jury, there is actions to take against some folks, that is the special counsel's job, although, again, I would caution that this leaking is absolutely against the law.",
  "They -- they are reflecting a mood among a lot of Republican senators where they feel like they would like this president to succeed on policy, but they really feel like he has put certain elements of our democracy at risk.",
  "And so take it from this song and what -- and what you see music being able to do in your work or just in general, to create those bridges, because right now we are in a place where people don't feel like there are bridges.",
  "And that, you know, some of the -- of the Republicans who support this president's agenda said that he was very well versed in the facts and the details of tax reform and other legislation that they discussed at the lunch.",
  "The letter read, Mr. Truman, as you have been directly responsible for the loss of our son's life in Korea, you might just as well keep this emblem on display in your trophy room as a memory of one of your historic deeds.",
  "And we saw it on display this week with the discussion and wobbling about 401(k) and how you adjust their taxability to make the amount of money you're taking out of the Treasury looks smaller, OK.\n\nDICKERSON: Right.",
  "When you listen to music and you hear someone's tone on the instrument or a beautiful voice or the sound of bass resonating with the sounds of the symbols and all these things coming together, it's like the universe.",
  "But the fact is that the -- the majority of Republican voters across the country do not believe that saying something like NFL players should respect the flag and stand for it is an act of grievance or resentment.",
  "And one of the reasons that Donald Trump has succeeded to the degree that did he in changing the Republican Party into one that is the party of Trump is because he just wraps his arms around all of these issues.",
  "The real problem, John, is that, unlike where New Jersey was from an infrastructure perspective back in 2012, Puerto Rico's infrastructure, because of its bankruptcy, was degraded significantly before the storm.",
  "Empathy is something that when you put it into practice, your response becomes less verbal and less physical and it becomes more emotional, because you have to sit back and reflect for a while before you act.",
  "Having his former chief of staffer call Steve Bannon a white supremacist I think was a real error, in part because actually Steve Bannon supports several of the same candidates that Mitch McConnell supports.",
  "But even more, watch what happens with tax cuts, because what you hear from senators, when you say -- and why is there silence is, but he was elected, which is a totally legitimate point and, but tax cuts.",
  "DICKERSON: Given you have given advice to the president, he has not often listened, but given -- if this comes out on Monday, what is your guidance in terms of trying to stick to those issues you want to?",
  "And I think it's important for people to remember also that when you do end up with these special counsel investigation and the first set of charges start come through, you tends to start at the bottom.",
  "It's just a blend of everything that I think, if we, at our best, the ideal of American life at its best is everything coexisting and the great compromise of every element being here and living as one.",
  "And if you look at the Congressional Budget Office analysis, if we have just four-tenths of 1 percent increase in our GDP, which is entirely realistic, it will cover the cost of the tax reform package.",
  "There's unity among some, but there's not much room for error in the -- because the simple majority in the Senate and that they were not able to clear that bar for the Affordable Care Act replacement.",
  "And so, for instance, I have heard stories we have sent more folks than any other state in America to Puerto Rico to help, 1,100 National Guardsmen and state police, all who have Sandy experience.",
  "He talked about waving certain Medicaid rules that will open up literally thousands of treatment beds to poor folks across this country who need treatment who right now can't get access it to.",
  "CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: Well, it's typical to do it that way, in my experience, and especially if you want to get certain things organized before you confront the potential defendant.",
  "We spent $25 million in the last six months on an advertising campaign in New York and Philadelphia to eliminate the stigma around treatment and to encourage people to reach out and get help.",
  "But I think what we can say pretty definitively at this point is that the Muller investigation is not winding down, which is what the White House wants to -- wants people to think right now.",
  "We, in public, don't have much restraint in a lot of the way people behave, but I think it was Thelonious Monk who, in his notes to his band, talked about, you don't have to play every note.",
  "DICKERSON: Is that the difference here, David, between tax cuts and -- and the Affordable Care Act replacement, which is basically everybody knows that regardless something has to give?",
  "I mean nothing animates this president more than lashing out about this Russia investigation and trying to throw the blame back onto his political opponents, including Hillary Clinton.",
  "DICKERSON: The president talked this morning about -- do you -- you know, during the Clinton years, the independent counsel, Ken Starr, took -- I mean the Clinton team went after him.",
  "And you have to go out and do your job honestly, forthrightly, and let the evidence lead to you conclusions, not have conclusions beforehand and look for evidence that confirm it.",
  "Senator, given that experience and the interviews and work you have done on that committee, what -- how do you process this news about sealed indictments from the special counsel?",
  "And so the idea that we may know, in fact, that there has been some activity done already, depending upon who leaked that information, that could be a criminal violation as well.",
  "So as a general matter, cutting taxes is an easier thing to do than reforming health care because it is giving things to people rather than potentially taking it away from them.",
  "Late Friday, the news broke that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to influence our elections has resulted in at least one sealed indictment.",
  "The suspense is probably only temporary, as those charges could be made public as early as tomorrow, when a judge will likely unseal the indictment in order to make arrests.",
  "And I have not hesitated to disagree with the president, whether it's with his comments after the incidents in Charlottesville or on the very important health care issues.",
  "I think that that dossier is concerning in part because the FBI was willing to engage with the creator of it and -- and potentially was on -- on path toward paying for it.",
  "We are having a very interesting hearing this week looking at the Russians' use of social media to influence the elections and sow the seeds of dissension in our country.",
  "And so what I would say the important thing about today for the American people to know is, the president is not under investigation, and no one has told him that he is.",
  "And so they're having to airlift things there, and it's delaying things significantly, while they try to rebuild these roads and get the infrastructure back up on power.",
  "And the president has not talked -- George Bush himself came out the other day with his speech talking about what a danger this is to our democracy and Russia meddling.",
  "We're at a point where there is much more that we don't know about what's going to be happening potentially on Monday with Mueller and indictments than what we do know.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJON BATISTE, BAND LEADER OF \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": This song has that thing about it that makes us have a sense of reference for it.",
  "They want people to believe that this is an investigation that has largely run its course, that there is no evidence of collusion and therefore nothing to see there.",
  "Governor, we have a lot to get to, but, as a former federal prosecutor, I want to start with this news about what Robert Mueller, the special counsel, may be up to.",
  "And everyone who listened to him this week, with the personal story that he told about his brother, understands that it's not just a policy issue for the president.",
  "But you've seen the president, you know, certainly he understands I think the stakes involved in -- if this gets stopped, the rest of his agenda is really at risk.",
  "MARCUS: There doesn't seem to be any reluctance on the part of the -- not necessarily the White House, but certainly its allies, to start going after Bob Mueller.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: I don't know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard, debases our country in the way that he does.",
  "And I'm not saying I don't have hope for our nation, but I do feel like there's something that we can learn and sooner or later who will be forced to learn it?",
  "We're also joined by \"Washington Post\" columnist and deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus and the founder and publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Ben Domenech.",
  "And we're just going to have to work even harder at Puerto Rico because of how bad a shape it was in from an infrastructure perspective before the storm hit.",
  "We recommended in our first commission report that he use either the Public Health Safety act or the Stafford Act to be able to declare a national emergency.",
  "So, but I think one of the things to be concerned about here, John, is that there are strict laws against any of this type of leaking of grand jury activity.",
  "John Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz came before Senate Intelligence Committee and said, we don't know who paid for this.",
  "So I don't think anybody should expect that if we do see indictments this week, that it will be the last or the final announcement from the special counsel.",
  "He's gone out to states where there's Democratic senators and tried to put pressure on them and talked about, you know, maybe getting some Democratic votes.",
  "I think music has the power to get people into the room together that may not come into the room with one another if it weren't for the musical experience.",
  "If those people were dying at the hands of a terrorist organization, how much money would the United States Congress be willing to spend to make it stop?",
  "Truman, whose presidential desk held a sign that read \"the buck stops here,\" kept the letter and medal close at hand for the last 19 years of his life.",
  "They may not agree with Steve Bannon when it comes to the priorities they would like to see that Senate advance, but they do agree who the problem is.",
  "But as -- as Ruth indicated, in so many different ways, this is one of those areas where everything really remains very muddy at the current stance.",
  "We have a State Department and a secretary of state whose job is to exercise full diplomacy, to keep our men and women in uniform out of harm's way.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: We must stop pretending that the politics and conduct some of in our executive branch are normal.",
  "When he died, they were found in his desk drawer, a reminder that the toughest presidential decisions last long after a president's tenure is over.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: President Trump has reflected recently on the difficulty of consoling the families of fallen service men and women.",
  "If he thinks that this doesn't line up with his priorities directly, then he may not be as strong of an advocate for it as Republicans would like.",
  "Love him or leave him was the choice for Republican lawmakers last week, as two senators questioned the president's competence and moral standing.",
  "It's the only way that we can assure the American people that they can have some trust in government and that we're working to better their lives.",
  "It's difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance.",
  "But as you mentioned, the president has lot of power in his own party because he has a relationship with those voters that you mentioned earlier.",
  "\"The Washington Post\" reported this week that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee donated, paid for part of its creation.",
  "CORKER: Look, we have got a short window of time to deliver on tax reform, something that I want to see happen on behalf of the American people.",
  "CHRISTIE: Well, I think he laid out things that are going to cost real money, John, if you listen to what he said this week at the White House.",
  "MARCUS: You know, what was remarkable about the Flake and Corker comments wasn't simply that they made it about a president of their own party.",
  "Was that two senators on their way out to retirement or was it the start of something different than just kind of criticism of this president?",
  "We've seen that again this morning talking about -- which I think we'll talk about in a minute, this dossier and the Democratic funding of it.",
  "So...\n\nDICKERSON: Let me -- before we get to tax cuts, while we're in the Russia neighborhood, in August, Congress passed sanctions on Russia.",
  "So you have a trillion dollars that we can use for dynamic scoring, in the event dynamic scoring shows that we can use that trillion dollars.",
  "And, by the way, John, when groups start rallying -- when they start rallying against things, and they succeed, everything starts unraveling.",

  "This is the one area where they will run into the spears of opposing opinion absolutely willingly because they think that it's their issue.",
  "But I have spoken to Tom Bossert, the homeland security adviser, on a number of occasions, and Governor Rossello on a number of occasions.",
  "BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, we certainly know that -- that the Clinton campaign and the DNC did pay for access to this dossier.",
  "Until these leaders start to put out more resistance toward Trump, I don't think you're going to see whole lot of other -- others follow.",
  "And all reports at that lunch, which came on the same day as this Flake speech, was that there wasn't a whole lot of sparks or fireworks.",
  "We spoke with him about his reinterpretation of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" project for \"The Atlantic's\" podcast \"Radio Atlantic.\"",
  "And then when there's space, it allows you to appreciate what you just heard and to understand it and to process it and then to respond.",
  "On the one hand you have Steve Bannon carrying the Trump torch saying we want lots of people, like President Trump, running for office.",

  "And, ultimately, that continues to get lost in this as this investigation goes forward about exactly what Russia did in this election.",
  "But what I would say is, the federal government has brought the resources to bear on Puerto Rico that is needed to be brought to bear.",
  "But it's a very important part of it, because we need people to understand that this crisis started not on a street corner somewhere.",
  "He is very methodically working through White House officials, other people who have been close to the president, doing interviews.",

  "Julie, this week you had two Republicans speak out very strongly about the president, but -- well, let me phrase it as a question.",
  "And the fact that his plan lines up at this juncture in a way that it hasn't ever before with the interests of Republican donors.",
  "And I believe, from talking to bipartisan members of Congress, that this is not something that is going to take very long at all.",
  "OFAC, the department of Treasury that deals with this, has been overwhelmed with all of the sanctions issues they have under way.",
  "You said that there some are -- quote -- \"ridiculous things\" in tax reform that don't do anything about to help economic growth.",
  "And you've seen Trump, I think, differently than on the Affordable Care Act, where he didn't really have a pro- active message.",
  "And that also potentially this dossier was used as the justification to look into other people in -- in Donald Trump's circle.",
  "DICKERSON: And the president, though, didn't say what you said in September in New Jersey when you were addressing this issue.",
  "But, really, it's different than what people think; $500 billion was just to synch up between current law and current policy.",
  "And -- but he also said, I didn't want to talk about divisive issues, like these culture war issues that we're talking about.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION and some political analysis on a very busy week in Washington.",

  "And my approach is to work with my fellow Republicans, with Democrats, with House members and also with this administration.",
  "It's only my perspective, my perspective, no, my perspective, no my -- no listening, no questions really, just constantly.",
  "And I do think that this has a lot more likelihood of getting moved forward than anything else that's come to the floor.",
  "DICKERSON: The next big issue with which you may have a disagreement or total agreement with the president is tax cuts.",
  "And then, this week, we will bring him a final report with even more recommendations on how to deal with this problem.",
  "You have this almost chorale like chant going on in the music mixed with the gospel choral style the way I'm singing.",
  "But I really think that comes from people not actually being in the same room enough to say, OK, you're just like me.",
  "And it's because they look at their own electoral prospects and Donald Trump is very popular among Republican voters.",
  "DICKERSON: Ben, as you mentioned, the president has -- they wants unity because they would like to get tax cuts past.",

  "Governor, given your experience with that hurricane, I wondered if you could reflect on the response to Puerto Rico.",
  "I think we're seeing that there is sexual harassment and even assault in virtually -- workplaces across the country.",
  "So, that's something that certainly all of us need to work on, but it's not something that I personally experienced.",

  "It's a burden he shares with all presidents who have ordered Americans into battle or who contemplate doing so.",
  "Whether you see something on the street or whether it's an event in the news, does it -- do you react in music?",
  "And I think they both believe that all the resources that need to be brought to bear are being brought to bear.",
  "JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, there's nothing like a good Washington drama to start off your week.",

  "So far, I'm encouraged by the discussions that I have had with the members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
  "You in the past have asked for -- you have been against some tax cuts because of the effect on the deficit.",
  "Again, I just don't know enough about -- I know nothing actually about what's happening on the other front.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDICKERSON: The president will need that party unity to get his tax plan through Congress.",
  "But what is actually the president doing to get in the way of the diplomacy you think should be happening?",
  "Or I heard you tell stories about your mother's smoking habit and your friend who had died from addiction.",
  "We have maybe different things going on culturally or in our upbringing, but we're all just here together.",
  "BATISTE: Well, what came out is a blend of things, which I think highly signifies the American experiment.",
  "And it looked very uncomfortable for -- for McConnell, but McConnell, there was certainly a show of unity.",
  "It's hard to even remember senators of opposite parties speaking that kind of language about a president.",
  "It's really -- I mean Steve Bannon, to his credit, has done a really excellent job with his profile here.",

  "After meeting with Senate Republicans, the president said there are far more loving him than leaving him.",
  "People are going to be coming in from all around the country to protect those pet things that they have.",
  "Now it is incumbent upon Congress to be able to appropriate money into the public health emergency fund.",
  "In Missouri, for instance, Josh Hawley, who's running for Senate, it doesn't matter who Steve Bannon is.",
  "And it's pretty hard to hate the person next to you when you're laughing and dancing next to each other.",
  "And even Corker said they hadn't really talked to each other at the lunch but there was no big outburst.",
  "And I'm sure Congress is going to approach it with that type of urgency, in concert with the president.",
  "They're going to react to this emergency like they have reacted to funding Puerto Rico, funding Texas.",
  "If you start taking things off the table on the front end, we're not going to get where we need to go.",
  "It leads us more fully towards the conflict that most of us would like to see resolved in another way.",
  "What do you think this is going to do to getting things done, say, on tax cuts and that kind of thing?",
  "What's your -- what's your sense of how this reaction to whatever news we get next week will play out?",
  "Flake essentially issued a call to arms from his colleagues and no one lined up behind to follow him.",
  "First, that they all -- they almost all of them do privately agree with that assessment more or less.",
  "If they're unable to get these tax cuts done, I think that really shatters the cohesion of the party.",
  "So it is going to be a hard, hard lift, but it is the absolute imperative for Republicans to survive.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDICKERSON: Bob Corker of Tennessee is another Republican critic leaving the Senate.",

  "PACE: Just the elevation of Steve Bannon I think is a fascinating political dynamic right now.",
  "DICKERSON: Let me ask you about, as a prosecutor, the president has said this is a witch-hunt.",

  "CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think that you're always going to be questioned as a prosecutor.",
  "DICKERSON: Let's go now to the criticisms from Senator Corker and Senator Flake this week.",
  "Senator Flake in particular said -- had message, it seemed, for his Republican colleagues.",
  "At times I think the Republican caucus wished he'd maybe talk about it in a different way.",
