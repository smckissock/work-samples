  "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (right) and Jordan's King Abdullah II (L) attend the Future Investment Initiative FII conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh on October 23, 2018 (AFP Photo/FAYEZ NURELDINE)\n\nRiyadh (AFP) - Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince appeared Tuesday at a glitzy investment forum boycotted by a host of global business leaders, as the petro-state admitted it is facing a \"crisis\" after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.",
  "But as the day progressed, the crowds thinned in the main auditorium even as Prince Mohammed sat in the front alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II and billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was detained in the hotel last year along with other elites in what authorities called a crackdown on corruption.",
  "Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman smiled and took selfies with cheering delegates during his 15-minute appearance on the opening day of the three-day Future Investment Initiative (FII), which is aiming to project the historically insular Gulf kingdom as a lucrative business destination.",
  "The conference, nicknamed \"Davos in the desert\", has been overshadowed by the outcry over the murder of Khashoggi inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on October 2, with a string of leading international investors pulling out over the case.",
  "Khan's government announced later Tuesday in a statement from Islamabad that Saudi Arabia had pledged $3 billion to Pakistan as it battles a balance of payments crisis, as well as to defer another $3 billion in payments for oil imports.",
  "- Tight security -\n\nThe Riyadh conference opened amid tight security at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Russian Direct Investment Fund chief Kirill Dmitriyev headlining.",
  "A wider Western boycott of the conference suggests rising political risks in Saudi Arabia that could hit foreign direct investment, which already plunged to a 14-year low last year, according to a UN body.",
  "They sought to rally around Prince Mohammed, the king's powerful son whose reform credentials have been tarnished by the scandal despite repeated denials he had any involvement in the killing.",
  "The comments came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded to know who gave the order for Khashoggi's killing in his country and the whereabouts of the slain journalist's corpse.",
  "- 'PR crisis' -\n\nThis year's conference contrasts with last year's inaugural FII -- a star-studded event at which Prince Mohammed was lionised as a visionary by speakers.",
  "Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser, corporate chiefs from JP Morgan, Ford and Uber, and media powerhouses like CNN and the Financial Times all scrapped plans to attend.",
  "Dozens of delegates walked a red carpet into the vast conference venue at the Ritz-Carlton, with a cathedral-like lobby, frescoed ceilings and glittering chandeliers.",
  "But Saudi organisers sought to portray it was business as usual, announcing 12 \"mega deals\" worth more than $50 billion in oil, gas, infrastructure and other sectors.",
  "A long list of investors and international policymakers have already declined to show up in Riyadh in apparent protest against the Khashoggi killing.",
  "SoftBank Group's chief executive Masayoshi Son -- who maintains close relations with the crown prince -- cancelled his speech, Bloomberg reported.",
  "After his brief appearance on the opening day, Saudi media said the crown prince would take part in a panel at the conference on Wednesday.",
  "In further efforts to diffuse the crisis, Saudi Arabia's cabinet said his killers would be held accountable \"no matter who they may be\".",
  "Falih heaped praise on the CEO of French energy giant Total, Patrick Pouyanne, for standing by Saudi Arabia in this difficult period.",
  "Ministers from Britain and France and the United States, which have huge defence deals at stake with Saudi Arabia, have stayed away.",
  "\"We see what partnership means when you have difficult times,\" Pouyanne responded as he shared the stage with Falih.",
  "Falih said the murder of Khashoggi was regrettable, adding that \"nobody in the kingdom can justify it\".",
  "And in a fresh setback, the forum's website went down on Monday after an apparent cyberattack.",
  "Organisers frequently changed the agenda of the event in a sign speakers were dropping out.",
  "But Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih acknowledged \"these are difficult days\".",
  "It was back up with reduced content as the conference progressed.",
  "\"We are going through a crisis,\" Falih said in his speech.",
  "\"This is when you really strengthen a partnership.\"",
  "There was no immediate claim of responsibility."
