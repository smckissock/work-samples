  "House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday publicly opposed the conservative-led bid to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, saying their accusations don’t rise to the necessary level of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\n“I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process,” Ryan told reporters when asked about the newly introduced articles of impeachment.",

  "The articles also assert Rosenstein has a conflict of interest for signing off on the final Page surveillance warrant and not later recusing himself or recommending a second special counsel as some Republicans have sought.",
