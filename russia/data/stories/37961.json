  "There is no certainty that Gannett will use this opportunity to table a higher offer, the people cautioned, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.",
  "Billionaire Mort Zuckerman also tried to sell The New York Daily News last year, but then scrapped the plan after bids for the newspaper came in too low.",
  "Last month, Gannett made an unsolicited takeover offer for Tribune at $12.25 per share in cash, in a deal worth roughly $815 million.",
