  "REUTERS/Larry Downing Blackwater founder Erik Prince is reportedly trying to convince the government of Afghanistan to use his private air force for close air support and intelligence collection, according to a proposal obtained by Military Times.",

  "Prince in May wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that a private contractor force under the command of a US \"viceroy\" working in Afghanistan would save money and fix what he called an \"expensive disaster.\"",
  "Erik Prince testifies before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on security contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 2, 2007.",

  "Durrant previously ran FSG's \"special aviation division,\" The Intercept reported in 2016.",
