  "(Trump Jr. was also asked about the similarity of Trump’s description of what he planned to speak about — “very, very interesting” — with Goldstone’s initial pitch to Trump Jr., which called the material “very interesting.” Trump Jr. said this was “just a coincidence” and that this was “the way my father speaks.”)\n\nWe’re asked to believe, then, that only Trump Jr. knew what had been promised by Goldstone before the June 9 meeting at Trump Tower and that the following things are unexplained coincidences:\n\nThat Trump Jr. and Agalarov left each other long voice-mail messages on June 6 and June 7 but may never have spoken.",
  "You will recall that Trump Jr. got an email from music publicist Rob Goldstone on June 3, 2016, in which he describes having been asked by his client Emin Agalarov — both a developer and a musician — to reach out about “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” being provided as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”\n\nTrump Jr. famously replied, “If it’s what you say, I love it.” That’s a big if, and Trump Jr. proposed a call with Agalarov seemingly to nail down whether the information was worth his time.",
  "“Ok” June 6, 12:40 a.m.: Goldstone emails Trump Jr. “Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary Info — you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day”\n\nGoldstone emails Trump Jr. “Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary Info — you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day” June 6, 3:03 p.m.: Trump Jr. emails Goldstone.",
  "I believe you are aware of the meeting — and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you?” In his testimony before the Senate committee, Goldstone likely spoke to Agalarov within an hour of sending his next email to Trump Jr. because “Emin was very short on patience.”\n\nGoldstone emails Trump Jr. “Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.",
  "“My cell” (the number is redacted) June 6, 3:43 p.m.: Goldstone contacts Agalarov’s band manager Pavel Klychko and then emails Trump Jr. “Ok he’s on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call”\n\nGoldstone contacts Agalarov’s band manager Pavel Klychko and then emails Trump Jr. “Ok he’s on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call” June 6, 4:04 p.m.: Agalarov calls Trump Jr.",
  "The emails Trump Jr. provided to the Senate committee include one from June 8 in which Trump Jr. tells Manafort that the “[m]eeting got moved to 4 tomorrow at my offices.”\n\nThere is no prior email provided in which he informs Manafort that the meeting was set to be at 3 p.m.\n\nOn the evening of June 7, candidate Trump gave a speech in which he teased an upcoming speech.",
  "I believe you are aware of the meeting — and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you?” In his testimony before the Senate committee, Goldstone likely spoke to Agalarov within an hour of sending his next email to Trump Jr. because “Emin was very short on patience.” June 7, 4:28 p.m.: Trump Jr. calls Paul Manafort again.",
  "Understanding that the offer at hand was dirt from the Russian government and acquiescing to it is a red flag for questions of coordination, and the newly released testimony hints that Trump Jr. spoke with Agalarov, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign adviser Jared Kushner about the matter before the meeting.",
  "Despite Trump Jr.’s vagueness about who he spoke with before the meeting, though, investigators did suss out a pattern that suggests strongly that Trump Jr. spoke with both Emin Agalarov (the Russian musician who initiated the idea of the meeting) and other campaign staffers before the meeting itself.",
  "(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nTo hear Donald Trump Jr. tell it, the enthusiasm he expressed after being offered incriminating information about Hillary Clinton in June 2016 was neither enthusiasm nor anything he remembers having shared with anyone.",
  "Thanks rob appreciate you helping set it up.”\n\nIt’s hard to read that timeline and not assume that Trump Jr. both spoke about the meeting with Manafort and Kushner and that he worked with them to finalize the time that it could happen.",
  "“I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,” Trump tells the audience after winning several primaries.",
  "That Trump referred to dirt on Clinton hours after the meeting was arranged but that the candidate may not have been aware of it, despite his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman having likely discussed it.",
  "Because it’s a period during which the understanding of the meeting was that it was meant to share negative information about candidate Donald Trump’s political opponent offered by the Russian government.",
  "Asked about the back-to-back calls with Kushner and Manafort, Trump Jr. told the committee “that was something that could happen every day on the campaign.” June 7, 5:16 p.m.: Trump Jr. emails Goldstone.",
