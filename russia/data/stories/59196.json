  "DIGENOVA: Well, as a result of the tactics authorized by Mueller and instigated by Mueller in New York, with the raid of the Cohen office, and as a result of the manner in which they raided the Paul Manafort home, it is now clear that Mueller is acting in bad faith, that he has surrounded himself with literally a bunch of legal terrorists, and that they are conducting an in terrorem grand jury.",
  "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: First of all, it is now clear that no matter what James Comey says about the president of the United States, which are disgraceful comments by a former FBI director and he has besmirched forever his term as FBI director, what we now know and have known for almost two years is James Comey is a dirty cop.",
  "Remember this whole witch hunt started when Mueller's best friend James Comey leaked his personal, potentially classified notes to his friend who was a professor at Columbia who leaked those notes to the press, all as a purpose for setting forward the wheels in motion for a special counsel, which he got another best friend Robert Mueller.",
  "This is clearly a guy that has his own self-aggrandizing, arrogant agenda who himself should be under investigation, who lied to Trump, mishandled the FISA court system, maybe even lies to the FISA court judges, we'll find out, leaked privileged government documents, failed to apply the law equally which should be everybody's concern.",
  "And based on all the text messages that so far have been exposed is a lot more coming, hopefully, one day, it's apparent that they were out to get Trump from the very beginning and they're the ones that texted about having the insurance policy in case Donald Trump actually won and called them pretty much every nasty name in the book.",
  "She pushed back on claims from Russia that the chemical weapons attack was staged by a Syrian rebel group even though Defense Secretary James Mattis who came to the White House today to brief the president on the latest military options was noncommittal on whether he can say with absolute certainty that the Assad regime is to blame.",
  "And while I agree with Alan wholeheartedly that Mr. Rosenstein cannot possibly ethically participate in this, it will make no difference to him because he now has an animus toward the president of the United States, which disqualifies him from the performance of his duties and Jeff Sessions should fire him tomorrow morning.",
  "Whether it's impromptu at tax reform conferences where he throws out the talking points and instead, talks about what people were very concerned about at that moment, which was the invasion that continues to happen on our border and pulling out all of this stuff--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGORKA: Sean, can I add one thing?",
  "In fact, what we should be doing is, and what we are doing is applying the elements of national power, diplomatic information, military, economic to enable our national security strategy which is to essentially prevent weapons of mass destruction and to have international order based on the rule of law.",
  "Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the fake and corrupt Russia investigation headed up by all Democratic loyalists, people that work for Obama, Mueller is most conflicted of all except for Rosenstein who signed the FISA and the Comey letter, and there's collusion so they go crazy.",
  "Whether they have to go and try to find a technical violation of banking laws on which they can hook pornography stars or things of that kind, and even your account which was obviously metaphorical and in part proves again, if you're determined to find crimes against anybody, you can do it.",
  "To its everlasting disgrace, today, the American Civil Liberties Union went out of its way to justify and defend the raid on the lawyer's office, never saying anything about the risks that it does to confidential communications, because most of your viewers don't know how taint teams work.",
  "Why would we ever sign off on giving away control of 20 percent of America's uranium to a hostile actor like Russia and a Russian state-owned company after the president of Uranium One pumped the Clinton Foundation with millions of dollars of cash, when we import 90 percent of our uranium?",

  "Not once -- not one smidgen of corruption and they actually towed the line despite fast and furious, IRS, Benghazi, and now they are excited, excited about lawyer-client privilege being broken for the first time in American history with regards to a presidential lawyer.",
  "When you have a former FBI director comparing a sitting president of the United States in the release of his book to mob family, mobs that are responsible for murder, extortion, money laundering, constitution drug dealing, I used the Comey model, if you will, tonight.",
  "So, Mr. Comey, you're really going to compare the sitting president of the United States to a mob boss so you can make money, people that are tied to murder, drugs, money laundering, extortion, prostitution, loan sharking and all sorts of other racketeering crimes.",
  "DERSHOWITZ: If he takes the Fifth, they can give him immunity and then they can compel him to testify and the evidence can be used against him in an impeachment proceeding because the privilege against self-incrimination doesn't apply in an impeachment proceeding.",
  "Trump taking to Twitter earlier today: 'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria get ready Russia because they'll be coming nice new and smart and you shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his own people and enjoys it.'",
  "The other key point that I'm hearing from Republicans on Capitol Hill who have been investigating the possibility of a second special counsel is that James Comey is a fine one to talk because even before this book has come out, there are some big developments.",
  "And if I were a lawyer for Donald Trump and I am not, I'm just saying what I would say about anybody, I would be making a motion in front of a judge -- first, I'd make it into the Justice Department to recuse Rosenstein, then I'd make it in front of a judge.",
  "Remember notorious gangster organized the illicit gambling, prostitution, tax evasion and, of course, was responsible for an untold number of murders, including seven people in one day which is now famously known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.",
  "Living up to its anti-Trump reputation, the liberal mainstream media they've have gone totally off the rails over the FBI's highly questionable raid on Michael Cohen, and of course, President Trump's harsh criticism of Robert Mueller witch hunt.",
  "He is destroying his reputation through the thuggish tactics which he has authorized and through the people that he has surrounded himself with Andrew Weissmann--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDERSHOWITZ: But let me remind you--\n\nHANNITY: Last word, yes, sir.",
  "Under the threat of contempt and impeachment, Rod Rosenstein finally today at the last hour cooperated with the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his request to see the original document that started this Russia investigation.",
  "The tactics that they have chosen to use against a president of the United States, against whom there is no evidence of a crime and never has been from the beginning, the use of those techniques has delegitimized this investigation.",
  "HENRY: Well, there is some shock about this, number one, because it certainly makes it seem like James Comey is much less of an honest broker than he has portrayed himself in the mainstream media when he says things like that.",
  "Why do we have to push it to this point and it is it amazing how Rosenstein, all of a sudden, starts cooperating after others are threatening him with impeachment and then threatening Christopher Wray in contempt of Congress.",
  "During Mueller's time as a federal prosecutor in Boston, four -- four men wrongfully imprisoned for decades framed by an FBI informant and notorious gangster Whitey Bulger, all while Mueller's office looked the other way.",
  "Of all the people, the former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the person responsible for taking down actual deadly criminal gangs, shouldn't James Comey know better to make an outrageous comparison like that?",
  "He directed his political action committee, remember, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars, an obscene amount of money, to the state senate campaign of Jill McCabe, the wife of, oh, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.",

  "And Jeff Sessions now has an obligation to the president of the United States to fire Rod Rosenstein after Rosenstein authorized the unconstitutional and unprofessional search of the office of Michael Cohen in New York.",
  "DIGENOVA: And by the way, if Mueller attempted to immunize him, I happen to believe that there are legal arguments that would make the president not have to comply with an order to make him testify before a grand jury.",
  "Russia has about 11 warships in the vicinity of its naval base in Syria that have been put out to sea in recent hours as Russian officials declare they are ready to engage any U.S. or ally warships that fire on Syria.",
  "General Tata, at this point, with all the bluster from Moscow, not Putin himself, when you -- when Russia starts pulling their ships out, they obviously don't want to be collateral damage here or involved in this.",
  "I recall a time before the election when the left and the leftists in the media lectured America when they were so confident that it was going to be Hillary Clinton that we had to accept the election results.",
  "And last but not least, we can go on all night, look at John Gotti, convicted of 13 murders, also involved in racketeering, tax evasion, at least illicit gambling and, of course, obstruction of justice.",
  "Also tonight, we cannot forget the U.S. preparing to respond to Syria's gas attack against innocent men women and children, the president sending a clear warning to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
  "And I would just like to say, unlike with the Democrats have been trying to do in this country for the last 16 months which is to remove a duly elected president, regime change is not our goal in Syria.",
  "The President of the United States has made clear to those around him and those who were closest to him in the White House and among his friends that he is determined to shut down this investigation.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you seen enough evidence to blame the Assad regime for this most recent chemical attack, have you seen evidence, are you confident to make that assumption?",
  "But, Joe, I want you to weigh on the taint aspect of this and more importantly, the person that has attorney-client privilege that that would be the president's right to invoke, not Michael Cohen's.",
  "Joining us now, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova, author of 'Trumped Up: How Criminalization of Political Differences Endangers Democracy', Professor Alan Dershowitz.",
  "GORKA: Now look, Sean, look, I just came back from L.A., and I'm meeting with people in California who are finally actually optimistic that they can get some sanity back into the people's republic.",
  "It ain't the rule of law when they kick in your door at 3:00 in the morning and you're faced with armed men and you have had no reason to be told you're going to have that kind of treatment.",
  "Knowing what we now know about what is obvious deep state crime families trying to take down the president -- again, staying with Comey's analogy, aren't you now glad that Trump fired Comey?",
  "That's why we have to restrict and limit the application of the criminal law to clear unequivocal crimes and don't use it against political enemies unless the evidence is just overwhelming.",
  "Because now I would argue they've now got to go on offense and they've got to make their case and they've got to understand that it seems like there's no topic that is off the table here.",
  "I mean, if you are familiar with \"The Caine Mutiny,\" the novel, Captain Queeg was the crazy guy onboard the ship who was on this fishing expedition for strawberries that he couldn't find.",

  "I think what they may be doing is trying to save face with Syria as they remove all possible threat from, you know, U.S. airplanes, jets, missiles, that could be coming in.",
  "A longtime Clinton aide, remember, Huma Abedin, who possessed classified information on her private computer uncovered in the Anthony Weiner underage sexting investigation.",
  "I guess since Comey, if he's going to use the sweeping analogy, I've decided tonight we're going to use the Comey standard, I call it, and make some comparisons of our own.",
  "But tonight, disgraced former FBI Director James Comey is days away from kicking off the much-anticipated media blitz where he is likely going to hawk his new book of his.",
  "This brings us to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, OK, part of the same family, OK. She helped rig the primary for Hillary Clinton as head of the DNC, according to Donna Brazile.",
  "We'll remind Comey tonight what a real mob boss looks like and you would think that a former FBI director would understand this but we'll give him an education tonight.",
  "Since Comey clearly doesn't know what he's talking about, we're going to remind the former FBI director what an actual mob boss looks like, like for example Al Capone.",
  "Comey, with Peter Strzok and others, they wrote an exoneration in May before they even interviewed her or other witnesses in July, an exoneration before investigation.",
  "They are trying to trap him into a perjury trap or simply get information that they can send to Rosenstein to transmit to the House of Representatives for impeachment.",
  "That puts us right about now which is why the U.S., Russia, and Syria, all the militaries of those nations preparing for the possibility at least of military action.",
  "And they are detached from reality because compare that to what the average person outside the bubble is lived through in the last 15 months, and they are loving it.",

  "HANNITY: Professor Dershowitz, you have said that the raid on Michael Cohen's hotel room, his home and his office was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
  "HANNITY: You know, the complicity here is very key because the media not looking at the FISA abuses, not looking at Hillary's, we know she committed felonies.",
  "And that's what happens and that's, of course, why they want him to come and testify because remember, you can be charged with perjury for telling the truth.",
  "HANNITY: With one of the most atrocious records of any lawyer that I've ever read about, and frankly even Mueller, going back to Boston and the anthrax case.",

  "This president has said in fact that he's trying to learn the lesson of the previous president who put out the red line in Syria but did not enforce it.",
  "If somebody else gives a contrary story and the prosecutors decide to believe the other person, you can end up in a perjury trap for telling the truth.",
  "And it is also very clear that Rod Rosenstein is so incompetent, compromised and conflicted that he can no longer serve as the deputy attorney general.",
  "It ended up with a perjury charge for not disclosing an alleged sex relationship with a woman that had nothing to do with the alleged underlying crime.",
  "What Rod Rosenstein and Bob Mueller have done is weaponized in an unconstitutional way the criminal investigation process which should be sacrosanct.",
  "Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together to stop the arms race.",
  "DIGENOVA: Look, I must tell you, I find this raid of Mr. Cohen's office so appalling in every sense -- legal, ethical professional responsibility.",
