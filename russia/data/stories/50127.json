  "A top Facebook executive, who had already announced his departure, took the fall on Wednesday for hiring an outside public relations firm to investigate billionaire George Soros and generate negative publicity on the company's critics.",
  "He said they focused efforts on people who had been critical of the company, including Soros, who had given a speech in January 2018 where he \"attacked Facebook\" and called it a \"menace to society.\"",
  "The Times reported that the tech company had employed a Republican-affiliated public relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, which tried to discredit an anti-Facebook group by linking it to Soros.",
  "After the report was published, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters he did not know his company hired the firm, and attempted to distance Facebook from its actions.",
  "However, Elliot Schrage, Facebookâ€™s outgoing head of communication and policy, published a statement on Wednesday taking responsibility for hiring Definers.",
  "Soros is a frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and was even sent a pipe bomb in October.",
  "The admission came following a scathing report published last week by the New York Times."
