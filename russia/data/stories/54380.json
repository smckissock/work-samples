  "\n\nWhen Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to a campaign finance violation related to the Stormy Daniels payment, he stated that he’d worked in coordination with Donald Trump to make the payment, made “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nOne of the ironies at the heart of President Trump’s effort to hide an alleged sexual encounter in 2006 with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels is that, had the story emerged shortly before Election Day 2016, it’s not clear it would have done much damage.",
  "Anything beyond that, I would refer you to outside counsel.”\n\nAsked whether he knew about the payment at the time it was made, Sanders replied, “Not that I’m aware of.”\n\nSanders is also asked why the Trump campaign continues to pay Cohen for legal services.",
  "Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.",
  "We keep learning new ways in which this coverup was constructed, with the addition Tuesday morning of a report in the Wall Street Journal indicating that Trump personally pushed earlier this year for a restraining order to be issued against Daniels.",
  "We say it in part, too, because the emergence of the story after his inauguration nestled neatly into the well-worn grooves of public opinion in the Trump era: His supporters mostly wave it off while his opponents splutter with irritation.",
  "When Cohen pleaded guilty to a campaign finance violation related to the Daniels payment, he stated that he had worked in coordination with Trump to make the payment, made “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.”\n\nOct. 26.",
  "In an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity (who had been identified as a client of Cohen’s the previous month), Trump’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani claims that the $130,000 paid by Cohen was ultimately repaid by the Trump Organization.",
  "But it’s still important to highlight, specifically because it reinforces the extent to which Trump and those around him tried to cover up and lie about something that, had another path been taken, might not have been a big deal at all.",
  "Martin was asked to sign off on the arbitration documents by Mr. Rosen,” an outside attorney, “who told her the request came from Eric Trump, according to the people familiar with the matter,” the Journal reported Tuesday.",
  "And anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president’s outside counsel.”\n\nPressed on the claim that the president had addressed the payment, Sanders reiterated that Trump “has denied the allegations against him.",
  "Trump told Mr. Cohen to coordinate the legal response with Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, and another outside lawyer who had represented Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization in other matters, the people said.",
  "Eric Trump, who is running the company with his brother in Mr. Trump’s absence, then tasked a Trump Organization staff attorney in California with signing off on the arbitration paperwork, these people said.”\n\nFeb. 13.",
  "“Justice” took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal.” Such respect for a brave man!",
  "Trump praises Manafort for not breaking under pressure from the feds, taking a swipe at Cohen in the process by implying that Cohen “made up stories.”\n\nI feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family.",
  "Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.”\n\nLater that day, Sanders is asked how Trump rationalized having denied knowledge of the payment in the April 5 interview.",
  "“In so doing,” the government document says, “he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.”\n\nNov. 4.",
  "Martin emailed a statement from the company that said she facilitated the filing ‘in her individual capacity’ until a New York-based lawyer gained approval to practice in California,” it reports.",
  "There were no campaign funds going into this, which would have been a problem.”\n\nTrump speculates that Cohen’s legal trouble is unrelated to his work for the president or the Trump Organization.",
  "The next day, Cohen transferred the money from a home equity line of credit — a loan that was fraudulently obtained, he later admitted — to an LLC he had created called Essential Consultants.",
  "“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” he says.",
  "The Journal’s report on Tuesday indicates that Trump told Cohen to get a restraining order against Daniels, seeking to enforce the hush agreement before she gave an interview to the media.",
  "The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair, despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair.",
  "“The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”\n\nIt’s important to note that this, at the time, was questionable.",

  "To separate his business from his new role, he hands over control of the Trump Organization to his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.",
  "The White House replies, “These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election.”\n\nJan. 18.",
  "Trump for the first time answers questions about the Daniels payment directly during a conversation with reporters on Air Force One.",
  "“Look,” Sanders says, “the president has addressed these directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true.",
  "The Wall Street Journal reports another hush agreement involving Trump and the National Enquirer, mentioning Daniels tangentially.",
  "In an interview with Forbes in March 2018, Eric Trump describes how the wall between the president and his business will work.",
  "But Trump, his campaign team, his administration and his private business all contributed to trying to bury the Daniels story.",
