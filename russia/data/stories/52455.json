  "The government of China declined our request for an interview, but sent us this comment: \"China has long suffered from massive cyber attacks ...(and) firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks in accordance with law... groundless speculation, accusation or hyping up is not helpful...\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, Daniel McGahn is rebuilding with much of his business now shifted to India.",
  "The Justice Department says that the scale of China's corporate espionage is so vast it constitutes a national security emergency, with China targeting virtually every sector of the U.S. economy, and costing American companies hundreds of billions of dollars in losses -- and more than two million jobs.",
  "Editor's Note: The author of the original article \"A Harsh Winter for Sinovel and China's Wind Industry,\" which was later attached to the phishing email in this video, wishes it known that he was not involved in a cyberattack against American Superconductor.",
  "If spying is the world's second oldest profession, the government of China has given it a new, modern-day twist, enlisting an army of spies not to steal military secrets but the trade secrets and intellectual property of American companies.",
  "But one of the things that has happened is that the military units that have been responsible for these hacks have actually had their mission taken away from them and it was given to the Ministry of State Security, their version of the CIA.",
  "George Kurtz: Whenever there's a big lawsuit we'll see the Chinese government actually break into that company, break into the legal department and figure out what's going on behind the scenes so they can better deal with that lawsuit.",
  "Lesley Stahl: So Sinovel using the stolen source codes has sold wind turbines here in Massachusetts using to--\n\nDaniel McGahn: --to the government of Massachusetts funded by the federal government of the United States of America.",
  "Dmitri Alperovitch: Once they clicked on that email and they opened up the attachment, malicious codes started executing on their machine and it beaconed out to the Chinese and basically let them right in to the company.",
  "But in September during a visit to Washington, President Xi Jinping pledged for the first time that China would not engage or knowingly support cybertheft of intellectual property for commercial gain.",
  "Lesley Stahl: There's a lotta criticism out there among businessmen, and some people in the government, who complain that President Obama wags his finger at the Chinese but he doesn't do anything.",
  "And if there's a dedicated nation state who's using its intelligence apparatus to steal day in and day out what we're trying to develop, that poses a serious threat to our country.",
  "But adding insult to injury, Sinovel is now exporting wind turbines with his stolen technology, including one purchased by the state of Massachusetts using federal stimulus funds.",
  "They are, according to this recent report by the technology research firm INVNT/IP, in effect, blueprints of what industries and what companies will be targeted for theft.",
  "John Carlin: They want to develop certain segments of industry and instead of trying to out-innovate, out-research, out-develop, they're choosing to do it through theft.",
  "CBS News\n\nJohn Carlin is the assistant attorney general for National Security with responsibility for counterterrorism, cyberattacks and increasingly economic espionage.",
  "His firm spent years and millions of dollars developing advanced computer software for wind turbines that McGahn says China looted, nearly putting him out of business.",
  "But getting CEOs from those companies to talk is nearly impossible because most of them still have business in China and don't want to be cut out of its huge market.",
  "Daniel McGahn: We made sure that any software or any pieces of the code were restricted and used, were able to be accessed, only by a few people within the company.",
  "The arrangement included a $1.7 million contract that was spelled out in emails and instant messages that McGahn's investigation found on Dejan's company computer.",
  "In 2014, five military officers in the unit were criminally charged with economic espionage by John Carlin's National Security division at the Justice Department.",
  "Dmitri Alperovitch: We were able to determine with great confidence that this was Unit 61398, part of the Chinese military that was responsible for this attack.",
  "To find out, he launched an internal investigation and narrowed it down to this man, Dejan Karabasevic, an employee of American Superconductor based in Austria.",
  "George Kurtz: Every industry, engineering documents, manufacturing processes, chip designs, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, you name it it's been stolen.",
  "Not surprisingly, the Chinese authorities refused to investigate, so Daniel McGahn filed suit in civil court -- in China, suing Sinovel for $1.2 billion.",
  "CBS News\n\nDmitri Alperovitch: It's the first time ever they've admitted that economic espionage should be off-limits and that they will not conduct it.",
  "The director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center confirms that there is no evidence China has curtailed its economic espionage.",
  "If it doesn't change, then we need to keep thinking of additional actions, whether they're trade actions or sanctions that change the behavior.",
  "Sinovel made the skeletons of the turbines, and his company, American Superconductor, the sophisticated gadgetry and computer code to run them.",
  "John Carlin: These were officers in uniform and their day job was to get up, go to work, log on, and steal from a range of American companies.",
  "Initially, business boomed in China for American Superconductor, with sales skyrocketing from $50 million-a-year to nearly half a billion.",
  "Unfortunately, what we saw is that the very next day, the day after they were in the Rose Garden shaking hands, the intrusions continued.",
  "Well, his story begins when China passed a clean energy law in 2005, calling for the creation of mega-wind farms throughout the country.",
  "Dmitri Alperovitch: They also wanted to figure out the legal strategy of the company now that they were suing Sinovel for $1.2 billion.",
  "But he suspected that China was still spying on his company, and that Beijing had switched from Cold War to cutting-edge espionage.",
  "And they couldn't reverse-engineer it\n\nLesley Stahl: Everybody knows if it's on the Internet, some brilliant hacker can get at it.",
  "Daniel McGahn: So the U.S. government facilitated bringing the stolen goods into the U.S.\n\nLesley Stahl: And they're here now?",
  "McGahn hired Dmitri Alperovitch and George Kurtz, cofounders of a computer security firm called CrowdStrike, to investigate.",
  "By analyzing who the email was sent to, they were able to infer that the Chinese were after more than just computer codes.",
  "Lesley Stahl: I've seen one of the messages, the text message, in which Dejan says, \"I will send the full code of course.\"",
  "So the team looked at the turbine and saw running on our hardware a version of software that had not been released yet.",
  "John Carlin: And then it continues until the end of the day, 5 or 6 o'clock--\n\nLesley Stahl: And then they go home.",
  "John Carlin: The bottom line I think has to be that we continue to increase the costs until the behavior changes.",
  "Sinovel executives showered him with flattery and encouragement: you are the, quote, \"best man, like superman.\"",
  "And you would watch, as we put in an exhibit in the case, the activity would spike around 9:00 in the morning.",
  "George Kurtz: It's one of the most prolific groups that we've tracked coming out of the Chinese government.",
  "All you have to do, he says, is look at the economic plans published periodically by the Chinese Politburo.",
  "When he went into business there, China was already notorious for poaching American intellectual property.",
  "Dmitri Alperovitch: We estimate that there are several thousand people in this unit alone, this one unit.",
  "Lesley Stahl: And did they make these turbines with your brains in them for the entire country of China?",
  "Then, in 2011, his engineers were testing the next-generation software in China on Sinovel's turbines.",
  "So McGahn partnered with a small Chinese firm called Sinovel which was partly owned by the government.",
  "In this one, from him to a Sinovel executive, Dejan lays out the quid pro quo, \"All girls need money.",
  "Is there talk of putting any sanctions on the way we did with Russia when they went into the Ukraine?",
  "They zeroed in on a suspicious email purportedly sent by a board member to 13 people in the company.",
  "\"A private company can't compete against the resources of the second largest economy in the world.\"",
  "A private company can't compete against the resources of the second largest economy in the world.",
  "From that point they can hop to any machine and take any file that they wanted from that network.",
  "John Carlin: We see them put out the strategic plan, and then we see actions follow that plan.",
  "The software had been programmed to shut down after the test but the blades didn't shut down.",
  "So he says he did everything he could think of to protect his technology from being stolen.",
  "Daniel McGahn: And what they did is they used Cold War-era spycraft to be able to turn him.",
  "Lesley Stahl: It sounds like you built a little fortress around your, your precious codes.",
  "If we don't do things like bring the indictment then we would be a paper, a paper tiger.",
  "Daniel McGahn: And they're here now and it's part of a--\n\nLesley Stahl: Up and running?",
  "They get into work, turn on their computers, and start hacking into American companies.",
  "Then it calms down a little bit from about 12:00 to 1:00 where they take a lunch break.",
  "Dmitri Alperovitch: We were brought in because the attacks now continued in cyberspace.",
  "The following is a script from \"The Great Brain Robbery\" which aired on Jan. 17, 2016.",

  "He was one of the few people in the company with access to its proprietary software.",
  "Today, his factory floor is largely silent, a shadow of this once thriving company.",
  "Lesley Stahl: What is their ultimate goal, the Chinese government's ultimate goal?",
  "It's what every technology company wants to get to, is this high level of growth.",
  "John Carlin: Well I think it's important that we do take, that we do take action.",
  "Dejan eventually confessed to authorities in Austria and spent a year in jail.",
  "Unit 61398 is believed to be based in this nondescript building in Shanghai.",
  "Too many lives were affected, too many families were damaged through this.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Now did you know at that time who had perpetrated the hack?",
  "Lesley Stahl: Do you have a number of U.S. companies that have been hit?",
  "China has always denied that it conducts or condones economic espionage.",
  "It's unbelievable what they've been able to steal over the last decade.",
  "Daniel McGahn: I think part of the strategy in all this was to kill us.",
  "Daniel McGahn: That's the full code for operating their wind turbine.",
  "Daniel McGahn, the head of American Superconductor, is an exception.",
  "So then we had to figure out how did, how could this have happened?",
  "A few people clicked on an attachment and that let the Chinese in.",
  "Lesley Stahl: You know, it feels like a pinprick, your indictment.",
  "Lesley Stahl: And did they say, \"We want the-- the source codes\"?",
  "Lesley Stahl: Do you know any specifics of what they offered him?",
  "And what they learned was this encrypted protocol was in the way.",
