  "“Young people are more aware of the value of privacy than we were 10 years ago.”\n\nAmanuel says that the Cambridge Analytica story, with its exposure of widespread data harvesting, helped prompt her to get off social media, and many more young people seem to be turning against Facebook; on Tuesday, it was reported that the number of Facebook users aged 18 to 24 in Britain is expected to fall 1.8% this year.",
  "“Constant screen time damages your ability to see, and it also causes internal damage, such as anxiety.” Studies have shown that social media use can negatively affect mental wellbeing, and adolescents are particularly susceptible: one nationally representative survey of US 13- to 18-year-olds linked heavier social media use to depression and suicide, particularly in girls.",
  "The fact that Gen Z have had their every move documented online since before they could walk, talk, or even control their bowels helps explain their antipathy to social media: it makes sense for them to strive for privacy, as soon as they reach the age when they have a choice over their online image.",
  "Some of the teens I spoke to were concerned about how technologies such as Snap Map – a Snapchat feature that tracks your friends geographically, in real time – were spreading through their schools, and mistrustful of the privacy consequences of being surveilled by your followers wherever you go.",
  "“Everyone goes through other people to find me,” Morgan laughs, “and when I hear that they’re been trying to get hold of me I say: ‘Great!’ Why would I need 500 flakey friends?”\n\nBut when you are from a digitally native generation, quitting social media can feel like joining a monastery.",
  "“If you meet someone new and they ask for your Instagram and you only have 80 followers,” says Sharp, “they’re going to think: ‘You’re not that popular’, but if you have 2,000 followers they’re going to be like: ‘You’re the most popular person in school.’” Sharp quit social media at 13.",
  "Other reasons included feeling tired of the conflict or drama they could see unfolding among their peer group online, and feeling oppressed too by the constant firehose of information.”\n\nBielby agrees that young people are becoming more aware of the amount of time they waste online.",
  "“They’re becoming overwhelmed with the responsibility of maintaining their social sites and with upholding the somewhat inflated persona many have created on these sites, where they are constantly seeking approval via the amount of likes they get for any given post,” Bielby says.",
  "“Like Instagram: I was presenting this dishonest version of myself, on a platform where most people were presenting dishonest versions of themselves.”\n\nLike Amanuel, Jeremiah Johnson, 18, from Luton, grew weary of the pressures of sustaining an online persona.",
  "I thought that’s what you guys do.’ And they say: ‘Thanks to you, because of the things you said and the stuff you’re doing.’ It’s quite cool.”\n\nQuitting social media is a determined move: apps including Facebook and Instagram are designed to be addictive.",
  "“And as younger Gen Zers notice this behaviour among their older siblings and friends, they too will start to dial down their use of social media.”\n\nAs the first generation to grow up online, Gen Z never had to learn social media, or at least not exactly.",
  "“Participating in that is not something I’m interested in.”\n\nHyper-connected teens have been faced with a surfeit of clicks, retweets and likes – and the dopamine rush of online validation – since the neural pathways in their brains were formed.",
  "As young people increasingly reject social media, older generations increasingly embrace it: among the 45-plus age bracket, the proportion who value social media has increased from 23% to 28% in the past year, according to Ampere’s data.",
  "“It’s your own shop window or brand.”\n\n“Framing a picture and posting it on there is not a five-minute thing,” says Amanuel, explaining that any post will be well-thought-out in order to project a certain image and maximise likes.",
  "“They’re constantly studying, but their only distraction is social media.” Rather than get sucked into a “mindless vortex of never-ending scrolling,” as she puts it, when Isabelle isn’t studying she prefers to be outdoors.",
  "Quarter of 14-year-old girls in UK have self-harmed, report finds Read more\n\nWhile many of us have been engrossed in the Instagram lives of our co-workers and peers, a backlash among young people has been quietly boiling.",
  "“Not just those people you accept on a friend request who are friends of a friend.”\n\nFor Tyreke Morgan, 18, from Bristol, being a hard man to get hold of – he has no social media presence at all – has its advantages.",
  "42 likes.’ I just thought: ‘This is ridiculous.’”\n\nIsabelle, an 18-year-old student from Bedfordshire who doesn’t want to disclose her surname, turned against social media when her classmates became zombified.",
  "According to a study by US marketing firm Hill Holliday of Generation Z – people born after 1995 – half of those surveyed stated they had quit or were considering quitting at least one social media platform.",

  "Another survey of 9,000 internet users from the research firm Ampere Analysis found that people aged 18-24 had significantly changed their attitudes towards social media in the past two years.",
  "There are some days I’m really convinced I want to reinstall it, not for myself, but because I want to appear normal.”\n\nStill, refuseniks such as Johnson may not be outliers for ever.",
  "In a world in which everyone is online, renouncing social media is a renegade, countercultural move: as quietly punk as shaving your head or fastening your clothes with safety-pins.",
  "Of the young people Hill Holliday surveyed who had quit or considered quitting social media, 44% did so, she says, in order to “use time in more valuable ways”.",
  "And I thought: ‘I don’t really want to be swept up in that.’” For 15-year-old Emily Sharp, from Staines in Surrey, watching bullying online was the final straw.",
  "Teenagers are also educated about the ramifications of an offensive tweet, or explicit picture, as well as the health consequences of too much screen time.",
  "They glided through every iteration: Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), Instagram (2010) Snapchat (2011) in real time, effortlessly adopting each one.",
  "It was getting in the way of schoolwork or jobs, with more than a third of respondents citing this as their primary reason for leaving social media.",
  "Dr Amanda Lenhart, who researches young people’s online lives, conducted a survey of US teenagers, asking them about taking time off social media.",

  "“It takes hours of deliberation.”\n\n“When social media started, we didn’t really know what it was going to mean,” says Binns.",
  "“If you’re having a bad day and scrolling through it, you’re constantly bombarded with pictures of people going to parties.",
  "“Young people want to get away from the curtain-twitching village, where everyone knows everything about you,” Binns says.",
  "People feel like social media is a part of them and their identities as teenagers and something you need to do,” she says.",
  "And 41% of the Gen Z teens surveyed by Hill Holliday reported that social media made them feel anxious, sad or depressed.",
  "But for every young person hunched over a screen, there are others for whom social media no longer holds such an allure.",
  "“The game of Instagram is who can maximise their likes by being the most risque, outrageous or conformist as possible.",
  "It was like I’d revealed something disgusting.” She explained that she did have a Snapchat handle, but never used it.",
  "That deterred me from using it.”\n\nIt is widely believed that young people are hopelessly devoted to social media.",
  "One 2017 survey of British schoolchildren found that 63% would be happy if social media had never been invented.",
  "“We found that 58% of teenagers said they had taken at least one break from at least one social media platform.",
  "She believes we will definitely see an increase in younger people quitting or substantially reducing their use.",
  "So while today’s teens spend a lot of time online, they don’t actually share that much personal information.",
  "“Our research shows that the biggest fear of quitting or pausing social media is missing out,” Bielby says.",
  "These teens are turning their backs on the technology – and there are more of them than you might think.",
  "It became: ‘Can I have your number to text you?’ Something got lost in terms of speaking face to face.",
