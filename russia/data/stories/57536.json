  "Associated Press/Manuel Balce Ceneta\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A watchdog report ordered in 2012 by Dr. Ronny Jackson — President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs — found that he and a rival physician exhibited \"unprofessional behaviors\" as they engaged in a power struggle over the White House medical unit.",
  "The six-page report by the Navy's Medical Inspector General found a lack of trust in the leadership and low morale among staff members, who described the working environment as \"being caught between parents going through a bitter divorce.\"",
  "In a Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018 file photo, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson speaks to reporters during the daily press briefing in the Brady press briefing room at the White House.",
  "Jackson has been hurt by the emergence of allegations about inappropriate workplace behavior, including over-prescribing prescription drugs and drinking on the job.",
  "\"There is a severe and pervasive lack of trust in the leadership that has deteriorated to the point that staff walk on 'eggshells,'\" the report found.",
  "The report, reviewed Tuesday by The Associated Press, suggested the White House consider replacing Jackson or Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman — or both.",
  "The inspector general report reviewed by The AP includes no references to improper prescribing or the use of alcohol.",
  "Trump said he would stand behind Jackson, calling the White House doctor \"one of the finest people that I have met.\"",
  "President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that Jackson, his pick for VA secretary, might want to withdraw.",
  "But he questioned why Jackson would want to put up with the scrutiny, which he characterized as unfair.",
  "To be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren't thinking nicely about our country?\"",
  "Kuhlman was the physician to President Barack Obama at the time.",
  "He said Jackson would make a decision soon.",
  "\"I wouldn't do it,\" Trump said.",
  "\"What does he need it for?",
  "What do you need this for?"
