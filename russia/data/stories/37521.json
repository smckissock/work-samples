  "Core Media Group, which owns production companies that create shows like American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday in New York City, shocking many in the television and media world.",
  "The media firm claims in its bankruptcy documents that it is currently almost $400 million in debt, and it doesn’t appear that the company will be able to climb out of that hole without some help.",
  "The show’s creator departed the program years ago, but he has since racked up fees as a consultant and he is owed a share of the profits of the brand.",
  "Core Media also owns another production firm, Sharp Entertainment, which itself creates several reality programs, such as Man v. Food.",
  "It was well-known that those titles weren’t performing like they used to, but few understood how dire the situation really was.",
  "To make things even more complicated, Core is itself owned by two companies, 21st Century Fox and Apollo Global Management.",
  "He is currently demanding around $3.4 million, and his coming for that cash is partly responsible for Core’s filing.",
  "The number one person that Core owes money to is Simon Fuller, the man most credited with bringing Idol to America.",
  "At the time, the reality singing competition was still incredibly popular, and the future looked bright.",
  "Core Media purchased 19 Entertainment, the company behind Idol, back in 2005.",
  "Now, a decade on, things clearly aren’t going as well as they used to."
