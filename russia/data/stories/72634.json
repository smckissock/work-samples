  "As we sat in my office, door closed, I was struggling to explain why I was uncertain whether to sign a new three-year contract with the network.",
  "Yet during negotiations, I was basically told I wasn’t “there yet” and I should have been happy that I had been offered a new contract at all.",
  "I thought my asks were minimal; I’d been “leaning in” for 15 years in the news business.",

  "The time spent away from my kid had to feel like it was worth the sacrifice.",
