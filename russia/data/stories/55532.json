  "A spokeswoman for the office of the secretary of Defense said that the timing of a detainee’s PRB is a “function of many variables.”\n\nThose variables include, but are not limited to, “the quantity and type of information available about a detainee and the length of time a detainee, his Personal Representative and Private Counsel (if any) need to prepare for the PRB.”\n\nThe spokeswoman also said that a detainee can be granted an additional full hearing if, during a file review, “a significant question is raised as to whether the detainee’s continued detention is warranted.”\n\nIn making the case for al-Kandari’s release during his second hearing, which was conducted Monday in Crystal City, Va., via closed-circuit television, his attorney, Eric Lewis, argued that the Kuwaitis have developed a rehabilitation program that will ensure that al-Kandari does not revert back to extremism.",
  "The board unanimously determined that al-Kandari did still pose a danger to the U.S.\n\n“The Board considered that the detainee almost certainly retains an extremist mindset and had close ties with high-level al-Qaeda leaders in the past,” the PRB ruled in al-Kandari’s case, noting “the detainee’s susceptibility for recruitment due to his connections to extremists and his residual anger at the US.”\n\nNEXT PAGE: Al-Kandari Has ‘Voiced Support For His Mujahidin ‘Brothers’ Overseas’\n\n\n\nAl-Kandari’s detainee profile notes that he is believed to have served as a recruiter and propagandist for al-Qaida in Afghanistan before 9/11 and for several months after.",
  "Records maintained under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) show that since 2005, a Kuwaiti law firm called the International Counsel Bureau (ICB), which operates the group Kuwaiti Counsel for the Families of Kuwaiti Citizens at Guantanamo Bay, has paid $14 million to seven different law, lobbying and PR firms as part of an aggressive, multi-front effort to free the 12 Kuwaiti detainees who have passed through Gitmo.",
  "Levick and other PR firms pitched “phonied-up stories” to reporters who regurgitated them with little investigation, she asserted, adding that “all of this may be legal, but it is hardly ethical.”\n\n“The Kuwaiti 12 case is a primer on the anatomy of a guerrilla PR offensive, packaged and sold to the public as a fight for the ‘rule of law’ and ‘America’s core principles,'” Burlingame wrote.",
  "In a phone interview she said that the lobbying push is another example of “dirty politics” in which national security is compromised because of “the government’s need to mollify what is a very good ally in the Middle East.”\n\n“The lawyers, meanwhile, are making good money from it,” she added.",
  "The purpose of the board, which is comprised of senior officials from the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, as well as the Joint Staff and the Office of the Director of National Security, is not to decide whether a detainee is guilty or innocent of terrorist acts.",
