  "In a Oct. 3, 1789, proclamation, he recommended that the states all carve out Thursday, Nov. 26, for “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”\n\nCongress met for the first time that year, so it was a busy time of implementing the Constitution that had been ratified the year prior — setting up the Departments of State, War and Treasury, for example, as well as taxing imported goods and establishing lighthouses — so the proclamation framed the Thanksgiving as a time for “acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.”\n\nThe country took his recommendation in 1789.",
  "As she explained in an 1851 editorial, “The last Thursday in November has these advantages — harvests of all kinds are gathered in — summer travellers have returned to their homes — the diseases that, during summer and early autumn, often afflict some portions of our country, have ceased, and all are prepared to enjoy a day of Thanksgiving.” On Sept. 28, 1863, she wrote a letter to that effect to President Lincoln, and sure enough on Oct. 3 he declared a national Thanksgiving for the last Thursday in November, elaborating in newspaper editorials that, “in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, the American people should take some time for gratitude.”",
  "Much-needed good weather or a victory in a skirmish with Native Americans — with whom, contrary to the more mythical Thanksgiving story, peace was the exception to the rule — might earn a mention from a colony’s governor, and a special day would be set aside, but when that day fell would obviously depend on what had happened.",
  "The 1984 book Thanksgiving: An American Holiday, an American History by Diana Karter Appelbaum explains why the other days of the week fell out of consideration among 17th-century Bostonians:\n\nAt first no particular day of the week was reserved for Thanksgiving, but some days thought more appropriate than others.",

  "Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book who might be thought of as the 19th century’s Martha Stewart, carried out a letter-writing campaign calling for the last Thursday of November to be designated a “Day of National Thanksgiving” throughout the mid-1800s.",
  "For example, leaders of the colony of Plymouth, Mass., called for a day of Thanksgiving in 1623 at the end of a severe drought when they felt like their prayers for rain had been answered.",
  "Friday was ruled out because it was the fast day of the Catholic Church and any day of prayer held on a Friday would have had Rome-ish overtones.",
  "Since Saturday was occupied with preparations for the Sabbath, and Monday was the day just after, these were not convenient choices.",
  "In subsequent decades, state governors kept up the tradition of declaring days of Thanksgiving, but the dates still varied.",
  "For Americans, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday — the fourth Thursday in November — can be a blessing or a curse.",
  "Those occasional Thanksgivings started becoming more formalized thanks to none other than George Washington, she says.",

  "Ministers offered afternoon sermons for those with the leisure time to attend weekday religious meetings.",
  "Puritans observe the Sabbath as a biblical ordinance and did not intrude their Thanksgivings upon it.",
  "Perhaps for this reason, Thursday early became the favorite day for fasts and Thanksgivings.",
  "Although other days were occasionally chosen, Thursday became the traditional choice.",
  "But, as it turns out, those sporadic days of thanks tended to fall on Thursdays.",
  "Crucially, they weren’t just a once-a-year special event.",
  "However, Thursday was a lecture day in Boston."
