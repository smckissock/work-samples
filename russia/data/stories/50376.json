  "Recently, Atlas Shrugs blogger Pamela Geller -- who is a key player in the Fear Inc. report, decided to focus her anti-Muslim rants at a Muslim GOP candidate, David Ramadan, that former Reagan administration Attorney General and Ronald Reagan Chair in Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation Edwin Meese was helping to support in a local Virginia House of Delegates race.",
  "I haven't heard anyone in the network of scholars, validators, or activists -- profiled in the just-released Center for American Progress report Fear Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America -- utter the above statement precisely.",

  "Reuters/Rebecca Cook\n\n\n\nAre you or are you not a card-carrying member of the pro-Shariah, Muslim Brotherhood network trying to force the citizens of the United States of America to submit to the hateful will of Allah?",
