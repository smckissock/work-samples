  "Oklahoma County Judge Howard Haralson said in a court filing released today that Hamm must fork over about $320 million by the end of the year, with the rest of it to be divvied up into installments of at least $7 million per month.",
  "This is a very positive outcome for Hamm, as well as for the rest of Continental's shareholders, who may have been somewhat concerned that an adverse ruling could have forced him to sell enough shares to dilute his stake below 50%.",
  "Divorce attorney Seymour Reisman emailed me this afternoon to say that Sue Ann Hamm got shafted in this judgement: \"Typically a wife of 26 years should expect to receive a minimum of 25-30% of the marital assets.\"",
  "For now, that title belongs to Russian \"Fertilizer King\" Dmitry Rybolovlev, who has been ordered to pay wife Elena $4.5 billion, though nowhere near that amount is likely to be paid anytime soon.",
  "Here's three:\n\nHarold Hamm: The Billionaire Oilman Fueling America's Recovery\n\nThe Birth Of A Wildcatter: How Harold Hamm Got His Start\n\nWhy Harold Hamm Isn't Worried About Plunging Oil Prices",
  "After two years of legal wrangling and a two-and-a half-month trial this summer, the founder and CEO of Continental Resources has been ordered to pay Sue Ann Hamm a total of $995.5 million.",
  "This has been a long and arduous process and we are appreciative of Judge Harralson and his staff for their dedication and attention to the witnesses and evidence presented.",
  "It also appears likely that Rupert Murdoch's 1999 divorce from wife Anna was pricier, as was Formula 1 honcho Bernie Ecclestone's split from Slavica.",
  "In an emailed statement to Forbes this afternoon, Hamm wrote:\n\n\"Today Judge Howard Haralson handed down his ruling in the Hamm v. Hamm divorce case.",
  "To make sure Hamm -- worth $14 billion as of this afternoon -- is good for it, the court placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock.",
  "I talked with Hamm about the divorce trial early this year and asked him if he was open to the possibility of getting married again someday.",
  "And so much for early speculation, roiling since papers were filed in 2012, that this divorce could end up being the costliest of all time.",
  "That’s never going to happen.”\n\nContinental shares were off 1.65% today, inline with the rest of the oil and gas sector.",
  "That was never a likely outcome, however; private bankers have been lining up to loan him whatever he needed.",
  "I've written a lot more interesting things about Hamm than this story about his divorce.",
  "Out of respect for my family, we will have no further comment on the matter.\"",
  "Hamm, 68, gets to keep one home, family pictures, guns, books and hand tools.",
  "Though he asked to keep a prized geode specimen, that went to Sue Ann.",
  "According to the court order, Sue Ann, 58, gets two homes and a ranch.",
  "His response ought to dash the hopes of gold diggers: “Definitely not.",
  "Hamm owns 253 million shares, or more than 70% of Continental.",
  "This is a fair and equitable outcome to the case.",
  "In this case, she got closer to 7%.",
  "Harold Hamm is finally divorced."
