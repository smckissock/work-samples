  "Planned Parenthood Federation of America held a conference call Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015, to discuss what it calls a “smear campaign” against the organization and its affiliates by a California-based anti-abortion group.",
  "Federal law prohibits abortion providers from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue, inducing someone to have an abortion to provide the tissue, or altering the procedure in any way to harvest fetal tissue.",
  "Research firm Fusion GPS said experts it hired on behalf of Planned Parenthood found it was impossible to determine how much the edits to the video distorted the meaning of what was said during the meetings.",

  "An Oregon affiliate provides placental tissue to a university, and clinics in Texas and Colorado have provided similar tissue over the past five years, but not fetal tissue, Planned Parenthood said.",
  "It sent a letter Thursday to congressional leaders and included a report by experts it hired who found that undercover videos of its officials were heavily altered by anti-abortion activists.",
  "StemExpress lost its bid to block the nonprofit from publicizing the video, but a judge said it will likely prevail in its lawsuit that claims its executives were illegally recorded.",
  "IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOCTORS ALTER ABORTION PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT FETUSES OR BODY PARTS ARE EXTRACTED IN WHOLE SO THEY ARE MORE VALUABLE TO RESEARCHERS?",
  "However, the group's experts said the video was manipulated through editing so that it sounded like she was talking about altering abortion methods to help harvest organs.",
  "In one video, Dr. Mary Gatter, one of Planned Parenthood's medical directors, discusses a \"less crunchy\" technique to increase the chances of recovering intact organs.",
  "One example Planned Parenthood offered of video manipulation involved a Planned Parenthood official in Texas discussing lab protocols intended to maintain tissue.",
  "Some conservatives are vowing to reject the budget legislation that funds the federal government this fall unless funding for Planned Parenthood is removed.",
  "In Congress, four committees are investigating Planned Parenthood, and Republicans plan to take another stab at stripping the group's federal funding.",
  "Fewer than 1 percent of 700 Planned Parenthood affiliated clinics nationwide offer fetal tissue donation for medical research, the organization said.",
  "Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS said the video work was \"sloppy at best\" and that transcripts provided by the center were inaccurate and erroneous.",
  "The videos were produced by a California-based anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress, which began releasing them in July.",
  "In addition to abortion services, Planned Parenthood also provides birth control and screening for sexually transmitted diseases.",
  "The National Abortion Federation is suing the Center for Medical Progress and its officers in federal court in San Francisco.",
  "It said the footage had no evidentiary value in an inquiry unless the original material was provided to investigators.",
  "The move was the latest development in a heated dispute that has riled people on both sides of the abortion debate.",
  "Planned Parenthood said in its letter to Congress that clinics receive $45 to $60 to recoup costs in California.",
