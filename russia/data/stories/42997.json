  "The Sony hack targeted the emails of Sony film executives, which revealed a side of Hollywood rarely seen by outsiders, and the decision to name the event as a catalyst for Facebook's message purge indicates how troubling the incident was in Silicon Valley — and that Facebook was concerned about being hacked.",
  "The Facebook-owned Instagram has long had the option to \"unsend\" direct messages, while the Facebook-owned WhatsApp recently launched a function in which unread messages could be deleted \"for everyone,\" with participants receiving notice that content had been deleted.",
  "TechCrunch reported Thursday that some old messages sent by Zuckerberg and senior executives had disappeared from recipients' Facebook Messenger inboxes, as proved by the original email receipts sent at the time.",
  "If a user long-presses a private message on Facebook, a \"Delete Message\" pop-up confirms that the function will \"delete your copy of the message,\" but the recipient's copy will remain.",
  "The news comes amid the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has seen Zuckerberg acknowledge that as many as 87 million users' data was exposed to the political-consulting firm.",
  "Zuckerberg may be the CEO of Facebook, but it's unclear how the decision to remove senior executives' messages would be allowed under the company's terms of service.",

  "Its own policies say the company \"should publicly make available information about its purpose, plans, policies, and operations.\"",
  "The company also raised the idea of a \"retention period,\" though there is no such thing for normal users.",
  "WhatsApp will let you, and so will Instagram— but if you're using Facebook, you're out of luck.",
