  "In a 2008 article, the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran of the Israeli Defense Force who is now the magazine’s editor-in-chief, recounted a conversation with Torossian about Palestinian terrorism in which the flack opined, “I think we should kill a hundred Arabs or a thousand Arabs for every one Jew they kill.” Goldberg described Torossian’s proposal as a “Nazi idea.”\n\nWhen it came time to choose a career, Torossian was wary of the debt load of a law school degree and the paltry pay in journalism.",
  "He’s pals with Torossian, too—Zampolli describes him as a “unique character” and a “mastermind.” Last month, before Torossian embarked on his anti-CNN crusade for Sinclair, he stopped by Zampolli’s Union Square townhouse for the diplomat’s 48th birthday party, where party favors included T-shirts with a mock CNN logo that said, “Fake News Network.”\n\nTrump’s longest-serving political adviser, the dirty trickster Roger Stone, has done work with Torossian, too, and once delivered a speech at 5W’s offices.",
  "Over the years, Trump has sought to distance himself from Sater, even claiming once under oath that he would not recognize Sater if the two were in the same room together—even though Sater worked for years out of an office in Trump Tower, carried a Trump Organization business card describing him as a “senior adviser to Donald Trump” and escorted Trump’s children during a trip to Moscow, where he claimed to have given Ivanka Trump special access to Putin’s personal chair inside the Kremlin.",
  "Years ago, Jody Kriss, a former executive at Bayrock Group, co-developer of Trump SoHo, found himself locked in a vicious legal and public relations battle with Bayrock managing director Felix Sater—Trump’s Russian-born former business adviser with a background in organized crime and an undercover career helping the U.S. government hunt terrorists—over allegations that Sater had fraudulently hidden his criminal past from his business partners.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, the hard-charging New York PR man caught Washington’s notice first when he announced in an op-ed that he had testified about his abortive dealings with Paul Manafort to a Washington grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, and then again when he emerged as the face of Sinclair Broadcasting’s caustic PR counteroffensive to charges that it forces affiliates to air pro-Trump propaganda.",
  "“And if you move quick, you wind up everyplace.”\n\nTrump’s invasion of Washington has catapulted the folkways, feuds and notable figures of midtown Manhattan into the center of the national political scene, bringing Torossian—the publicist the New York Times once dubbed “one of the New Yorkiest practitioners of this quintessentially New York profession”—along for the ride, just as his scorched-earth approach to the press is coming into vogue.",
  "In 2014, the New York Post spotted Torossian and the Leningrad-born Freidman praying for peace in Ukraine at a wedding at a Brighton Beach steakhouse along with Alfa Bank co-founder and Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman—whose relationship with Putin figures in the largely unverified “Steele dossier”—and New York attorney Ed Mermelstein, who often represents wealthy Russians.",
  "“At the highest level of intensity that any client may have, Ronn is still 10 times more intense,” says Sater, a man who himself once stabbed another man in the face with the stem of a margarita glass and reportedly helped turn the personal secretary to the head of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, into a U.S. intelligence source, among other purported exploits.",
  "Other clients over the years have included Maira Nazarbayeva, ex-sister-in-law to Kazakhstan’s autocratic leader (Sample headline: “I’m not wanted by Interpol”); Payday lender Cane Bay Partners; the “Shake Weight” exercise contraption; Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov; the rapper Pitbull; and the heavyweight boxer-turned-mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko.",
  "Harris, though, was impressed, telling Adweek after the episode aired: “That frequency and aggression of interruption I have not seen personally before.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nBefore long, Torossian was making a name for himself and cutting a familiar figure—head shaved, necktie optional, ears slightly protruding—on the New York social circuit.",
  "Since then, Sater has emerged as a key figure in the Trump-Russia affair, even before a late 2015 email surfaced last year from Sater to Trump’s attorney and personal fixer Michael Cohen in which Sater promised that Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin could help get Trump elected president and build a Trump Tower in Moscow.",
  "Unrelated to all this or to his work for the Turkish government, Manafort and his lieutenant Rick Gates allegedly approached Torossian in 2012 and asked him to take money from offshore accounts to perform undisclosed lobbying work for the government of Ukraine, an offer Torossian has said he rejected.",

  "In 2015, with New York City in the midst of a nasty falling-out with the New York Police Department over policing practices, Freidman and Torossian convened a meeting between de Blasio and Ed Mullins, the head of one of the city’s police unions, at Freidman’s Upper East Side home.",
  "Last year, as Mueller was bearing down on former national security adviser Michael Flynn for failing to register his work on behalf of Turkey, Torossian filed his own Foreign Agents Registration Act declaration disclosing his work for President Recept Tayyip Erdogan’s government.",
  "Torossian’s penchant for feuding is such that a few calls around the public relations industry leads to a 150-page book of opposition research on him with a timeline that begins at birth, the sort of document more commonly compiled by the opponents of a presidential candidate.",
  "Readers should take his word for it, at least according to his lawyer friend Mermelstein, who describes Torossian as “one of the most trustworthy people I know.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nTorossian’s numerous other ties to Trump world span the professional, the political and the personal.",

  "A disapproving Torossian drove the stake deeper, releasing a statement in conjunction with the video that called the cable news network “hypocritical and shameful.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nThrough all of the scrapping and pitching, Torossian has clawed his way to success.",
  "For Klitschko, Torossian hosted a 2008 meeting at his office with Rudolph Giuliani, who went on to appear in Kiev with the boxer ahead of that year’s mayoral vote and, more recently, joined Trump’s legal team this month promising to end the Mueller probe.",

  "So it was unsurprising earlier this month when the Trump-aligned Sinclair Broadcast Group, finding itself under fire for forcing affiliates to air Trump-like segments decrying “fake news,” called in Torossian to turn the tables on its critics.",
  "And it would appear they share the same appetite for risk: Torossian first got to know Cohen through pharmaceutical billionaire Stewart Rahr, a Trump pal and early Torossian client, and then through another client, “Taxi King” Gene Freidman.",
  "That tactic inspired another publicist to buy RonnTorossianPR.com and put a picture of a feminine hygiene product whose name is also used to describe an obnoxious person on it, which in turn prompted Torossian to sue the man for $20 million.",
  "But more often than not he was drawing attention for stumbling into the sorts of conflicts and controversies he was supposed be helping his clients navigate—a crisis PR man who often found himself ensnared in PR crises of his own making.",

  "“He’s the kind of guy you want in a fight, and he’s the future of PR, which I don’t think will be about being nice.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nFew have ever accused Torossian—who declined to comment on the record—of being too nice.",
