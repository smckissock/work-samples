  "Opponents wonder whether Britons should really be taking lessons about the Special Relationship from the man who had Winston Churchill’s bust removed from the Oval Office, arranged a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in the kitchens of a New York hotel, and who told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, “We don’t have a stronger friend and stronger ally than the French people.”\n\nMost Britons would take exception to Obama’s generalizations about the EU too, believing it was NATO, which predates the EU, that has made the world safer since World War II, and that large parts of the EU — such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland — are far less prosperous having been straitjacketed into the eurozone.",
  "When America objected, the European Commission sneered that it was a “triumph for Pentagon diplomacy.” Meanwhile Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004, openly stated that one of the aims of European integration is to “create a superpower on the European continent that stands equal to the United States.”\n\nWhy on earth does the Obama Administration think it serves America’s best interests to support and encourage the EU in keeping Britain a member, when a large number of Britons see their country as fully capable of functioning as an independent state, free of the costs and bureaucracy inherent in EU membership?",
  "The then Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, announced that, under this plan, “The EU can become an authoritative player on the world stage.”\n\nThe British Conservative politician Lord Vivian has stated that, “The creation of a European army goes some way towards the creation of a European superstate to rival America.” Similarly, when the EU introduced the Galileo global position system, European newspapers were told by the EU that it was designed to “rival” the U.S.’s Global Position Satellites System.",
  "Fortunately, even after half a century of EU membership, Britain’s institutions, values, language and laws still more closely resemble America’s than the EU’s, but should the coming referendum be lost — partly thanks to the interventions of President Obama and the State Department — Britain will be entirely taken out of America’s sphere of influence and placed into something that increasingly sees itself as an enemy camp.",
  "In 1993, Delors mused on French radio that Europe could one day be a force on the world stage to rival America, and when the Maastricht Treaty was introduced in 1994 he told journalists that it would allow Europe to “rival America and Japan.”\n\nWith a bigger population than America’s — at least with Britain as a member — the EU has a large, well-educated, highly skilled consumer market.",
  "By 2003, Jacques Chirac, then president of France, was openly talking of the need to develop a “multipolar world” and announced that “relations between the European Union and the United States will have to be relations of complementarity and partnership between equals.”\n\nIn 2000 Tony Blair argued, “Whatever its origin, Europe today is no longer just about peace.",
  "It is about projecting collective power.” The next year, Goran Persson, prime minister of Sweden, remarked that the EU is “one of the few institutions we can develop as a balance to U.S. world domination.”\n\nNo American president — with the possible exception of Obama — can possibly believe that it would be a good thing for American power to be “balanced” — i.e.",
  "Britain faces a referendum about whether to stay in the EU, so when the American president describes it as “part of the cornerstone of the institutions built after [World War II] that has made the world safer and more prosperous,” his remarks constitute a major foreign intervention into British domestic politics.",
  "The EU was of course highly critical of the Bush Administration’s approach to Iraq, which was its right, but it then tried to argue that EU member states that refused to join the U.S.-led coalition against Saddam Hussein nonetheless had the right to bid for contracts in the new country.",
  "In 2005, the book “Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century” by Mark Leonard of an influential pro-EU group, the European Council on Foreign Relations, was published, stating, “American hegemony contains the seeds of its own destruction, and is already driving its own retreat.",
  "“Having the United Kingdom in the European Union gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the transatlantic union,” said President Barack Obama on Thursday, thereby charging headlong into the minefield that is Anglo-European relations right now.",
  "President Obama seems to have swallowed the State Department’s half-century-old line that having a powerful and growing EU is automatically in America’s interests, without looking at the profoundly anti-American turn the Union has taken since the 1980s.",
  "It was Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission from 1985 to 1995, who started to turn the EU against the United States, making a number of negative remarks about America, and notably claiming: “Cinema explains American society.",
  "Today it wants to supplant the U.S. as the leading world power, and Americans ought to recognize it as a coming rival on the world stage with almost as much instinctive antagonism for America and her values as the Russians and Chinese feel.",
  "Once sucked into its sphere of influence, countries are changed forever.”\n\nThese are the kind of people Obama’s recent remarks have helped, to the detriment of those of us who believe in the Anglosphere and the Special Relationship.",
  "The supporters of Britain’s continued membership of the EU, which she joined in 1973, have hailed Obama’s intervention with glee, arguing that it proves that the “Special Relationship” would be badly damaged if she voted to leave.",
  "It’s like a Western, with good guys and bad guys, where the weak don’t have a place.”\n\nAmerica’s free-market institutions are anathema to Europhiles, who are instinctively dirigiste and protectionist.",
  "Someone with a true concern for America’s best interests should look with perfect equanimity at Britain trying to pursue her own independent national destiny outside the EU.",
  "Indeed, there are many Britons who see their country’s future as being far more intimately connected with the rest of the English-speaking peoples than with the EU.",
  "Quite a few of us would sooner join NAFTA, which doesn’t interfere in the domestic legislation of its member states in the way that the EU regularly does.",
  "Instead, the weight of the Obama Administration is brought down against the pro-Americans in the U.K., and on the side of America’s would-be antagonists.",
  "In 2002, the EU adopted its own “security strategy” which met a cold reception in the U.S., where it was rightly thought that this would undermine NATO.",
  "Even after half a century of EU membership, Britain’s institutions, values, language and laws still more closely resemble America’s than the EU’s.",
  "Why on earth does the Obama Administration think it serves America’s best interests to support and encourage the EU in keeping Britain a member.",
  "Meanwhile, President Obama’s blithe disregard for the oft-stated true aims of the EU project will ultimately damage America’s best interests.",
  "By the mid 2000s, the intellectual advocates of the EU were making obvious their desire to overtake the United States as a world superpower.",
  "… The lonely superpower can bribe, bully, or impose its will almost anywhere in the world, but when its back is turned, its potency wanes.",
  "Why Britons should listen to one of the least popular and effective American presidents of modern times is anyone’s guess, but they do.",
  "Yet quite apart from what’s in Britain’s best interests, does her staying in the EU genuinely serve American interests?",
  "For while it was founded in the 1950s by pro-Americans such as Jean Monnet, who admired FDR and the United States.",
  "With China posing a coming threat to American primacy, why does President Obama need to promote any more rivals?",
  "Andrew Roberts is the Lehrman Institute Distinguished Fellow at the New-York Historical Society.",
  "The president’s intervention in the EU debate is bad for the UK — and the US.",
  "It was Jacques Delors who started to turn the EU against the United States.",
  "The strength of the EU, conversely, is broad and deep.",
  "challenged — by any more forces than do so at present.",
  "EPA Opinion Dear Barack Obama, leave Britain alone!",
  "Power balance?"
