  "It is unclear whether Nunes — whose signature was the only one to appear on the letter and who, as chairman, has the power to sign off on subpoenas — was acting on behalf of committee Republicans when he subpoenaed \"any and all documents relating to the agencies' relationship with former British Secret Intelligence Service officer Christopher Steele and/or the so-called 'Trump dossier'\" on August 24.",
  "'Trying to put the government on trial'\n\nNunes' subpoenas also directed the DOJ and the FBI to \"provide copies of any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) — whether or not approved by the FISC — incorporating information provided by Mr. Steele, his sub-sources, and/or Fusion GPS,\" according to the letter.",
  "Nunes now wants to know why the FBI and the DOJ reportedly thought the information in the dossier was worth pursuing — and he has threatened to hold Sessions and Wray in contempt of Congress if they fail to provide \"the documents in full or testimony\" in an open hearing on September 14 \"to explain under oath\" their \"unwillingness or inability to comply in full with the subpoenas.\"",
  "Nunes' subpoenas, to which the DOJ and FBI apparently did not respond by the September 1 deadline, also covered documents \"memorializing FBI's relationship with Mr. Steele, any payments made to Mr. Steele, and efforts to corroborate information provided by Mr. Steele and his sub-sources — whether directly or via Fusion GPS.\"",
  "The chairman of the House Intelligence Community threatened to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Chris Wray in contempt of Congress if they did not respond to a subpoena for documents or testimony relating to the dossier alleging President Donald Trump's ties with Russian officials.",
  "\"Unfortunately, this decision by the majority stands in stark contrast to how they've treated other evidence in this investigation by first requesting voluntary compliance instead of jumping straight to subpoenas,\" Quigley said in a statement provided to Business Insider.",
  "\"So, if the CNN report is accurate, then I have to believe that the FBI and Department of Justice concluded (and the Court agreed) that the info in the dossier about Page was reliable,\" Rizzo said, \"and in all likelihood was backed up by other available intelligence.\"",
  "\"In my long experience in dealing with FISA processing, unconfirmed information about a potential target cannot (and has not been) included in the application?,\" John Rizzo, the former acting general counsel of the CIA, said in an interview earlier this year.",
  "Republican Rep. Mike Conaway took over the committee's Russia probe after Nunes stepped aside from the investigation in early April following his decision to brief Trump and the press on classified intelligence — without telling his fellow committee members.",
  "Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee's ranking Democratic member, told MSNBC on Tuesday night that he was \"perplexed\" when the committee's majority — likely represented by Nunes — told Democrats during the summer recess that they wanted to issue the subpoenas.",
  "CNN reported in April that the FBI used the explosive, unverified dossier detailing Trump's alleged ties to Russia to bolster its case for a warrant that would allow it to surveil Carter Page, an early foreign-policy adviser to Trump's campaign.",
  "Nunes said the intelligence showed Trump and his transition team had been \"incidentally\" surveilled after the election, but Schiff said at the time that he saw nothing that warranted Nunes' decision to go around his colleagues.",
  "In a letter dated September 1 and obtained by CNN, Rep. Devin Nunes vented about the pair's \"insufficient responsiveness to the committee's numerous Russia-investigation related requests over the past several months.\"",
  "Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed Schiff's claim that the majority had operated outside of \"standard practice\" when it issued the subpoenas.",
  "He also claimed that Republicans were trying to \"antagonize the FBI and the DOJ, and trying to provoke a conflict\" with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interference.",
  "Schiff said Democrats have been wanting to subpoena the White House for documents related to the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, but the Republicans on the committee \"have not been willing.\"",
  "Experts have explained that the FBI's use of the dossier to bolster the warrant means the bureau had enough confidence in the validity of the document to work to corroborate it and present it in court.",
  "And here I think there's a hope that if they can impeach Christopher Steele, and if they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, then maybe they can impeach the whole Russia investigation.\"",
  "\"The sole purpose of this subpoena is to discredit Christopher Steele instead of doing our due diligence to evaluate whether the claims in his report are true,\" he said.",
  "Conaway told reporters on Wednesday that he supported obtaining all of the relevant documents related to the dossier: \"We've got to run this thing to ground,\" he said.",
  "Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm, hired Steele in late 2015 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump on behalf of anti-Trump Republicans.",
  "\"We don't subpoena parties unless they turn down our requests for information, which the DOJ and the FBI really hadn't done,\" Schiff said.",

  "\"I think what's going on here is something I saw back in my days of a prosecutor,\" Schiff told MSNBC.",
  "Democrats took over funding for the research after Trump won the Republican nomination.",
  "\"Sometimes the defense opts for a strategy of trying to put the government on trial.",
  "Schiff, meanwhile, suggested he thinks something more sinister is happening.",
  "They told us they were going to do it anyway.\"",
  "We thought it wasn't warranted.",
  "\"So we opposed it."
