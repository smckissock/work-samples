  "This coming sale will be testament the proposition of the continuing value of real property – doubly so in real estate-crazed Orange County, which both defined the speculative real estate bubble, deeply suffered for it and is now re-embarked on that voyage – as compared to lowly, old newsprint-centric concerns.",
  "According to documents I’ve obtained, and confirmed, the company may produce about $6 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) this year, with that number projected to ramp by a million or two million dollars each year through 2018.",
  "Southern California roll-up gains impetus, as Orange County Register declares bankruptcy\n\nToday, the Orange County Register’s parent Freedom Communications Inc. said it would file for bankruptcy protection Monday, at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S.",
  "He’s gotten agreement from two big creditors, the federal pension regulator Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (owed $15 million), and Silverpoint (owed $22 million), the company’s main lender on the structure of this pre-packaged, bankruptcy filing.",
  "Such a move would be speculative and risky; the major value of the Register to Broad is only in combination with the Times and U-T.The Mirman/Spitz/Harrah group could both win the papers at auction as the “stalking horse” and keep operating them.",
  "Since TPUB CEO Jack Griffin fired his L.A. Times Publisher Austin Beutner in early September, the company has endured L.A. civic backlash, public questioning of its strategy by financial analysts, and a further drop of its share price.",
  "The odds continue to be better than even that a group led by Broad will emerge as would-be buyer for either the California papers (now formally the California News Group) and/or Tribune as a whole, within the next several months.",
  "While we’ve known for awhile that Freedom Communications would get to this point of a fresh bankruptcy filing, it is Tribune Publishing’s spring purchase of the Union-Tribune that changes the business dynamics of the big market.",
  "One clear endgame, put into play by this bankruptcy filing: a sale of the company’s assets, then the separation of its real estate assets, presumably kept by Harrah, and, then, a further sale of the newspapers themselves.",
  "The long-expected move (which I’ve recently noted here in my Media Notebook column) further sets the stage for the continuing roll-up of big regional newspapers in the 20 million population center of southern California.",
  "That acquisition may drive the price up for the Register and speed up what now seems like an inevitable single-company consolidation of newspaper ownership across a geography stretching for 200 miles from north to south.",
  "Fresh from its announcement that it is buying 15 papers from Journal Media – including the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, about which Tribune Publishing had talks as well – Gannett has signaled that it will make more buys.",
  "Digital First Media’s Los Angeles News Group constitutes the other daily player in southern California, and its Bay Area News Group (including the Mercury News) is dominant in California’s second largest region.)",
  "That’s the “stalking horse” position, the “friendly buyer.”\n\nRich Mirman, the Register’s current publisher, and Eric Spitz, Freedom’s board chair have teamed with Orange County real estate developer Mike Harrah.",
  "Lastly, L.A. businessman/philanthropist and erstwhile Beutner associate Eli Broad, who told Tribune he wanted to buy its California properties in the weeks before Beutner was fired, considers a next buying move.",
  "Agreement among the approximately two dozen creditors on final distribution of the asset sales could well be contentious; there’s a lot more owed than the combined newspapers and real estate will fetch.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nWho will end up owning the Register – located strategically between Tribune Publishing’s Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune, which Tribune Publishing bought in May?",
  "In short, though, after that bankruptcy – which followed a fascinating 75-year history of libertarian ownership by the Hoiles family – entrepreneur Aaron Kushner led a new group, taking over the paper.",
  "Would be-bidders for the Register and its now-sister Riverside Press-Enterprise (bought by Freedom from Belo in October, 2013) may see the company’s financials within three to six weeks.",
  "Given the likely expense synergies – most in printing, production and distribution – of linking the Times and U-T operations with the Register’s (and P-E’s), TPUB’s fit are clear.",
  "(Freedom’s net cash flow runs from $500,000 to $1.5 million annually, a further indication, if anyone needed one, of the difficulty of newspaper management these days.)",
  "We can project several scenarios, but overall at this point, let’s just note the complexity of all that is in the newspaper air in one of America’s biggest metro areas.",
  "In short order, he greatly expanded the company’s newsroom, added community sections, launched a daily edition in adjacent Long Beach and bought the Riverside paper.",
  "The most logical, strategic buyer for both the Register and the Press-Enterprise would be the owner of the papers on both sides, and that’s Tribune Publishing.",
  "They’ll formally name the number they’ll pay for Freedom’s newspaper assets – and its real estate – after a creditors’ committee defines the bidding process.",
  "Further, it is in midst of newsroom staff buyouts that will likely total fifty or more at the Times, and into the hundreds across the nine-city metro chain.",
  "Consequently, the separation of the asset sales and the proceeds distribution simplifies the question of who will own the Register and the Press-Enterprise?",
  "That’s been an important marker on the road to this filing; even a marginally profitable company would seem to fetch a higher price than a losing one.",
  "Tribune Publishing, of course, has found itself in the harsh glare of public scrutiny of late (“Tribune Publishing prepares to play more defense”).",
  "We can recall that it took the Tribune Company endured five years (emerging at the end of 2012) in bankruptcy court, before its case was resolved.",
  "How much are the newspapers worth and who might likely look at buying them, either at auction or after Mirman’s stalking group wins that auction?",
  "He should now expect questions about the company’s interest in -- and its financial wherewithal ability to complete – a buy of the two papers.",
  "That means that Freedom can proceed by early next year with the sale of assets – and then the creditors can argue about dividing the spoils.",
  "Mirman wins points from some of those creditors for his even-keel approach, even as worked to stabilize the Register’s operating budget.",
  "On Nov. 5, Griffin will review and explain the company’s third-quarter financial results, and talk more about the company’s strategy.",
  "Tumult in the O.C\n\nWe can detail a long, torturous road that brought the Register to this point, its second bankruptcy in six years.",
  "The developer bought the Register’s headquarters building and several other parcels of land for $27 million one year ago.",
  "Within the bankruptcy filing, Freedom’s current management has already stated its intention to buy the company’s assets.",
  "Gannett, newly acquisitive since its split from its formerly combined newspaper/broadcast company, could take a look.",
  "Given its strategic geographic value, though, and if there is competitive bidding, that number could well be higher.",
  "The Mirman/Spitz/Harrah group could both win the papers at auction as the “stalking horse” and keep operating them.",
  "Already, there’s one bidder-to-be, and another, Tribune Publishing, waiting in the wings, while others may surface.",
  "Newspaper brokers will tell you that real estate often drives half or more of the value of “newspaper” transaction.",
  "Then, there’s a non-newspaper name from that not-distant past that is newly circulating: Apollo Global Management.",
  "Further, he’s expressed interest in Freedom’s remaining real estate, 14 acres adjacent to the holdings he bought.",
  "Would Broad bid for the Register and PE to assert his bigger plans for southern California newspaper ownership?",
  "So how might this bankruptcy filing, and the freeing of pivotal, strategic assets, affect the Broad strategy?",
  "(And, if all that rings any bell of likelihood, might Apollo then be interested in an all-in California bet?",
  "Those would be atop the $12-20 million in annual synergies wrung out of the L.A./San Diego combination.",
  "One year ago, Mirman replaced the discredited Kushner (who is no longer involved with management).",
  "We can add three other names to a presumably short list of those eyeing the Freedom financials.",
  "If interested in those two, the logic goes, Apollo may well take a look at the Freedom papers.",
  "As Broad considers what kind of offer to make, the Freedom asset sale moves along in parallel.",
  "Now, its name is popping again as the question of the Times/U-T availability has been raised.",
  "Apollo almost bought out Digital First Media in May, before leaving the bride at the altar.",
  "Along the way, cash became scarce, bills piled up and the number of wronged creditors grew.",
  "For a short period, Kushner played the role of the Music Man of American daily publishing.",
  "A post-bankruptcy sale of the company’s assets should be completed within four months.",
  "“In the past year, we turned around to a positive cash flow,” Spitz told me Sunday.",
  "Tribune Publishing did not respond to request for comment today on its interest.",
  "“Both companies are “on board” with this action, says Freedom board chair Spitz.",
  "Significantly, though, this is a “363 filing,” part of the bankruptcy code.",
  "Job one: Dealing with the pressure from those creditors and debtors grew.",
  "At a market multiple of 3-4X, that might mean a value of $20-25 million.",
  "might be made before or after the bids are due for the Register/PE.",
  "Those synergies could range between $10 to $25 million annually.",
  "It’s a game of three-dimensional chess, with a timer thrown in.",
  "Finally, there’s the potential Register interest of Eli Broad.",
  "Who ends up owning the Register, and the Press-Enterprise?",
  "It is the real estate that drives Harrah’s interest.",
  "Those holdings are valued at about $35 million.",
  "It’s unclear whether a Broad bid for Times/U.T.",
  "While intriguing, that’s unlikely.",
  "It’s tough to gauge the price.",
  "Courthouse in Santa Ana."
