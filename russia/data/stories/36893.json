  "Interest in a trilogy fight between UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz has driven strong ticket sales for Golden Boy Promotions’ MMA debut, with Oscar De La Hoya estimating The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., being 70 percent sold.",
  "There’s ways of doing it, and I’ve been able to survive in the boxing industry because I know how to do it.”\n\nNow on the verge of entering a different combat sports industry, De La Hoya remains undecided on his next step as an MMA promoter.",
  "Once you sell out the gate, the pay-per-view numbers will be higher than expected.”\n\nDe La Hoya has made money – specifically how it’s distributed to fighters – a centerpiece of his first foray into MMA.",
  "They talk about Canelo or Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz.”\n\nDe La Hoya, a retired boxing champion turned promoter, expects the Nov. 24 fight card to be a sellout when walk-ups are included.",
  "He touted Golden Boy’s recent deal with DAZN as a sign of a strong marketplace and added he would approach the streaming service if Liddell vs. Ortiz 3 performs well on pay-per-view.",
  "He also anticipates a strong pay-per-view showing on Fite TV, which he said will benefit the headliners’ bottom lines from the first buy, and the event to be profitable overall.",
  "“Once this fight card takes place, I’m going to have some serious talks with John Skipper,” De La Hoya said, referencing the former ESPN president turned DAZN executive.",
  "“The price points are perfect for this type of fight, and fans are coming out and supporting it,” De La Hoya on Monday told MMAjunkie.",
  "And then we’ll take it from there.”\n\nIf the rivals wish to extend their comebacks, they’ll need to strike a new deal with Golden Boy.",
  "We feel that the gate being 70 percent sold, once you sell out the gate, the pay-per-view numbers are going to be relatively high.",

  "De La Hoya also had a front row seat at a promotion that paid its athletes extremely handsomely – and went out of business.",

  "His goal for the event is to give Liddell (21-8) and Ortiz (19-12-1) the biggest paydays of their careers.",

  "De La Hoya said the profit-sharing contract for the Nov. 24 event is a one-fight deal.",

  "“Everywhere I go, they don’t talk to me about the boxing cards I’m putting on.",
