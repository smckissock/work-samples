Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the Anthem hack “shows the urgent need to improve our nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.” Michael Daniel, President Obama’s chief cybersecurity adviser, said, “It’s quite concerning that we would have yet another intrusion of this size.”\n\nHackers have routinely targeted retailers rich with consumer data, including attacks last year that breached data for 110 million Target customers and 53 million Home Depot customers.",
