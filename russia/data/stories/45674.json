  "By the end of March, the disillusionment or fear around these stocks was widespread, as many wondered “Is The FANG Stock Trade Dead?”\n\nMuch of the concern was focused on Facebook (FB), after the news about Cambridge Analytica was revealed in the middle of March.",
  "As I pointed out in Fibonacci Investing Basics “FB needs a strong close above the 61.8% resistance at $177.60 to signal that the decline in FB stock is over.”\n\nFB closed at $177.97 on May 7th and is now testing the quarterly pivot resistance at $186.90.",
  "The weekly relative performance, which measures the performance of FB to the S&P 500, moved above its downtrend (line b) three weeks ago which was a sign that it was starting to lead the S&P 500.",
  "The stock market has tossed and turned this week in reaction to changes in the negotiations with North Korea and the looming threat of trade wars, but overall, it continues to act positive.",
  "Though the technical action on FB is positive it has already moved well above the quarterly pivot at $168.04, and it also still has headline risk, which has given me a reason to avoid it.",
  "However, from the perspective of technical analysis, it is more important to see if the weekly chart and technical studies are bullish or bearish and to identify the key levels to watch.",
  "The severity of the March decline took FB to its weekly starc- bands at the correction lows (point 1), which meant that FB was in a high-risk sell area, but a low risk buy area.",
  "This is consistent with the fact that the advance/decline lines, which had been in the corrective mode since March, finally completed their corrective patterns two weeks ago.",
  "A stop under $1048 would make the current risk under 4%, and if it does move above the resistance at $1141, the minimum upside target should be at the all-time high of $1198.",
  "The bullish action in NFLX indicates it can clearly move higher this summer, but it is already 10% above the three-week low, which makes the risk of new positions too high.",
  "As investors tried to evaluate the implications for the stock price of FB, many investors sold the other FANG members, as well as a number of the other big-cap tech stocks.",
  "So far in 2018 there has been much debate over the health of the FANG stocks, Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Alphabet, formerly Google (GOOGL).",
  "GOOGL is still within its continuation pattern, but there was some improvement this week, as it has held above the $1050 level and the 20-week EMA at $1067.",
  "The weekly starc+ band is at $377 while the completion of the rising wedge formation (lines a and b) has measured targets in the $400-$410 area.",
  "Those stocks with negative RS analysis, like the “The Five Most Oversold Dow Stocks”, will continue to perform worse than the overall market.",
  "Netflix, Inc. has been in the press all week, as its market value just surpassed Disney (DIS), making it the world's largest media stock.",
  "Alphabet, formerly Google (GOOGL) had a low of $984 at the end of March, which was just above the 1st quarter’s pivot support at $981.",
  "I apply the same analysis in picking ETFs and stocks in my Viper ETF and Viper Hot Stocks Reports, which come out twice each week.",
  "To turn fully positive, it needs to move above the recent weekly high, while a drop below the support (line c) would be negative.",
  "The weekly RS looks ready to make a new high this week, confirming the price action and the fact that NFLX is a market leader.",
  "The weekly relative performance for AMZN moved above its WMA on October 27, 2017, signaling that it was now a market leader.",
  "The weekly on-balance-volume (OBV) has been even stronger, as it reached good support (line c) as FB was making its lows.",
  "If AMZN breaks out to the upside the width of the formation (lines a and b) has upside targets in the $1716-$1730 area.",
  "Connecting this low with the February low at $997 creates the lower boundary of a continuation pattern (lines a and b).",
  "A move above the recent weekly high at $1118 should be enough to move the weekly indicators firmly into the buy mode.",
  "In recommending new ETFs or stocks, I try to use protective stops that can limit the potential loss to around 5%.",
  "The weekly chart shows that NFLX has now staged a weekly breakout, as the resistance (line a) has been overcome.",
  "The weekly OBV has been above its WMA since April 20th, and is still positive, but has not yet made a new high.",
  "From the March high, NFLX dropped 27%, AMZN was down 21%, and GOOG and FB were down 18% and 19% respectively.",
  "If this level is overcome, all owners of AMZN will have bought lower, so there is no overhead resistance.",
  "The weekly OBV did drop below its WMA for four weeks, but by the end of April it was back above its WMA.",
  "The above chart measures the percentage change in the FANG stocks' values since the beginning of 2018.",
  "It has been my view that the stock market will complete their continuation patterns by moving higher.",
  "During the decline in early February, AMZN tested the 20-week EMA in February with its low of $1352.",
  "With FB still under pressure, it makes a judgment using fundamental analysis even more difficult.",
  "The RS moved above its WMA at the start of the year and soon overcame the resistance (line c).",
  "There is minor support now at $180.13 with more important support now in the $170-$172 area.",
  "The weekly OBV looks ready to move above its WMA this week, which is an encouraging sign.",
  "A strong close above $1141 will trigger a breakout with the weekly starc+ band at $1195.",
  "Amazon.com (AMZN) looks the most attractive, as a stop under $1546 could safely be used.",
  "The OBV typically moves higher ahead of prices and the current reading is very positive.",
  "I also expect GOOGL to rally in the next several weeks and complete its flag formation.",
  "Each in-depth report is only $34.95 per month and can be canceled online at any time.",
  "So which of the FANG stocks currently have the best potential for a summer rally?",
  "The positive readings from the weekly studies favor an upside breakout for AMZN.",
  "The OBV moved above its WMA on April 20th and has surged to a new all-time high.",
  "Since then, AMZN is up over 45%, while the Spyder Trust (SPY) is up just 6.8%.",
  "The weekly starc+ band is at 1765 with the quarterly pivot resistance at 1858.",
  "The outlook for all of the FANG stocks changed after the sell-off in March.",
  "The weekly RS made a new high in March but is currently just below its WMA.",
  "The weekly RS stayed above its WMA, as the market corrected in early 2018.",
  "Amazon.com (AMZN) has traded in a narrow range for the past four weeks.",
  "The 2018 high is at $195.32 with the weekly starc+ band at $200.61.",
  "These formations are pauses or interruptions in an up or downtrend.",
  "There is now well-defined resistance (line a) in the $1638 area.",
  "The upside target from the formation is in the $1340-$1360 area.",
  "The small cap Russell 2000 has already broken out to new highs.",
  "Once AMZN moves above $1638, the stop could be raised further.",
  "This illustrates the benefit of investing in market leaders.",
  "There are potential upside targets in the $1713-$1730 are.",
  "This suggests a balance between the buyers and sellers.",
  "The upper chart resistance (line a) is at $207.78.",
  "This is a bullish sign for the coming months.",
  "The rally from the lows has been impressive.",
  "I will be updating this analysis on Twitter.",
  "The quarterly pivot resistance is at $413."
