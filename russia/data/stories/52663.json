  "Locked in a bitter battle with Russian-backed separatists, a Ukrainian artillery officer devised a cell phone app that allowed his men to aim and shoot their howitzers in seconds rather than minutes.",
  "But after they showed it off on YouTube, said Adam Meyers of the computer security firm CrowdStrike, Russian military intelligence soon hacked into the app.",
  "Fancy Bear is the name given to the group which also hacked into the e-mail of the Democratic National Committee.",
  "The malware has digital footprints all over it, including an IP address familiar to Meyers and CrowdStrike.",
  "“They’re really good at what they do and they’re doing it pretty much all day, every day,” Meyers said.",
  "“That’s actually a server that we’ve associated previously with the Fancy Bear actor,” he said.",
  "Only in this case, the cyberattack was not just disruptive -- it was deadly.",
  "Every member that was in there, even the geographic location,” Meyers said.",
  "Basically, malware turned the phones using the app into beacons.",
  "Those beacons were then used to target Ukrainian military units.",
  "CBS News\n\n“The backdoor allowed them full access to the device.",
  "Fancy Bear is known to work for Russian military intelligence.",
  "People were actually getting killed as a result of the hack."
