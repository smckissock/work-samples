  "The registration doesn't end the years-long US probe of Manafort and his firm which, because of Manafort's role as Trump campaign chairman last year, have become part of the broader investigation now led by special counsel Robert Mueller looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
  "The filing completed Manafort's registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA, one of several legal issues that have been the focus of scrutiny by the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.",
  "Jason Maloni, Manafort's spokesman, said Manafort \"started this process in concert with the FARA unit in September, before the outcome of the election and well before any formal investigation of election interference began.",
