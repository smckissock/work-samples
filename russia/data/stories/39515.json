  "The report included two embarrassing details: that garden furniture purchased for the official residence ended up in the first family's private residence, where Netanyahu also works, and accusations by a former caretaker that Sara Netanyahu pocketed up to $6,000 in deposits from recycled beverage bottles purchased with public funds over a four-year period.",
  "That suggests the left-of-center opposition, which supports compromise with the Palestinians and a bigger government safety net for the needy, has failed so far to make the case that Netanyahu is out of touch with Israelis struggling to afford the high cost of food, housing and other necessities.",
  "The report prompted Zahava Galon, chairwoman of the left-wing Meretz Party, to accuse Netanyahu of \"libertine hedonism\" that is \"a reflection of this government's complete disconnect from the citizens of the country and the adoption of corrupt norms more befitting a banana republic.\"",
  "In response, Netanyahu said on his Facebook page that it is \"unfortunate\" that rival campaigns are focused on the report \"instead of the immense security challenges that shroud our region, and the fight between a free and flourishing economy that we champion.\"",
  "(Photo: Gali Tibbon, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJERUSALEM — Israeli media and political opponents are having a field day bashing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife for free-wheeling spending of public funds at their official and private residences.",
  "The report by State Comptroller Yosef Shapira said spending by Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, for food and clothing almost doubled from 2009 to 2011 to nearly $106,000, but dropped to about $58,000 in 2012 following media reports that took them to task.",
  "Netanyahu's Likud Party said household expenses already have been reduced and that the comptroller's report contains \"absolutely no indication of any assault on the public's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions.\"",
  "But these are not the types of things a prime minister in Israel is ousted for,\" Nahum Barnea, a popular columnist for the newspaper Yediot Aharont, wrote following a report released this week on the prime minister's expenses.",
  "That's because security and the skyrocketing cost of living here apparently trump the Netanyahus' alleged extravagance as issues Israelis care most about when they cast ballots in the March 17 election.",
  "\"While these things sometimes have a delayed effect, I don't think it will have a major effect,\" he said, \"because the main election issues — security and the economy — remain.\"",
  "Yehuda Ben-Meir, director of the National Security and Public Opinion Project at the Institute for National Security Studies, also predicts the fallout will be minimal.",
  "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands next to his wife, Sara, after voting at a polling station for the Likud Party primaries on Dec. 31, 2014, in Jerusalem.",
  "Cleaning expenses during the 2009-11 period, especially at the family's spacious private residence by the sea, also doubled but began to drop in 2012, it added.",
  "\"Most Israelis associate the report with Netanyahu's wife,\" said Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University.",
  "It called the charges about the patio furniture and recycled bottle deposits \"inconsequential matters\" that the comptroller had not formally investigated.",
  "A Channel 10 poll released Wednesday — a day after the report's release — found the Zionist Union topping Likud, 23 parliament seats to 22.",
  "While an Israeli prime minister \"doesn't have to be an exemplary figure, he should be expected to know how to lead,\" Barnea wrote.",
  "\"That's what Netanyahu should be given a failing report card for, not for the way his household is being run.\"",
  "Shapira said the spending patterns violated the principles of \"reasonability, saving and efficiency.\"",
  "\"Everybody understands the prime minister is busy with other things, not his household.\"",
  "But he noted that the Netanyahus did not exceed spending limits because there are none.",
  "Still, the furor has yet to show much impact on next month's election outcome.",
  "A poll by the same TV station 10 days ago showed each party pulling 23 seats.",
  "In the wake of the report, polls showed little change in public sentiment.",
  "Much of those expenses were for take-out food, the report said.",
