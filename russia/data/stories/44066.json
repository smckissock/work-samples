  "Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida—four states that flipped to Trump by a narrow margin in 2016 after supporting Obama in 2012—were in the middle of the pack of states affected in terms of population: Florida came in at 21 percent, Pennsylvania at 23 percent, Michigan at 24 percent, and Wisconsin at 21 percent.",
  "But on Wednesday, Business Insider pointed out its existence, helping us learn more about specifics of the scandal, in which the political consulting firm improperly obtained the Facebook data of more than 87 million people ahead of the 2016 election.",
  "It’s followed by a swath of Southern states: West Virginia (31 percent), Kentucky (29 percent), Mississippi (29 percent), Alabama (28 percent), Arkansas (28 percent), Georgia (27 percent), Louisiana (27 percent), and Tennessee (27 percent).",
  "Maybe it reveals a strategy on the part of Cambridge Analytica—or perhaps it just gives us a glimpse of where Facebook users were the most likely to be interested in the quiz that the political firm used to collect data.",
  "Alexander Koerner/Getty Images\n\nOn May 1, Facebook released a state-by-state breakdown of how many people’s profiles were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data spill.",
  "Facebook’s chart provides a state-by-state breakdown of the total number of users whose data may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "And of course, correlation doesn’t equal causation: Just because these states were the most targeted doesn’t necessarily mean anything.",
  "As you might expect, the most affected states are among the most populous—California, Texas, Florida, and New York top the list.",
  "To do that, we used the numbers released by Facebook and data from the 2017 population estimates from the U.S. Census.",
  "The place with the highest percentage of affected users was the District of Columbia, which clocked in at 50 percent.",
  "The Facebook logo is displayed at the 2018 CeBIT technology trade fair on June 12, 2018 in Hanover, Germany.",
  "We asked Facebook whether it had that information and it said no, so we decided to crunch the numbers.",
  "Trump won all of these states, which wasn’t unexpected, given that they tend to vote Republican.",
  "Not many people noticed, because it was appended to a post originally published back in April.",
  "California is second to last on the list, with only 17 percent of its population affected.",
  "But we were curious about what that map looked like in terms of percentage of population.",
  "Some critical caveats: Not every state resident is a voter or has a Facebook account.",
  "But it tops Facebook’s list, since it’s the most populous state (about 39 million).",
  "But it’s still worthwhile to crunch the numbers from a population standpoint.",
