  "President Donald Trump again hit the ongoing Russia investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, calling it a “pile of garbage.”\n\nTrump said the Democrats were the ones colluding to “make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News.”\n\nThe president appeared frustrated that the conversation had to move on from his summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to focus again on the Russia investigation.",
  "Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.",
  "“[T]he thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime,” he wrote.",
