  "“There’s a wisdom-of-the-crowds angle here that most people haven’t leveraged in sensory [science],” he concedes, “but the idea that you have to throw away calibration, or good sensory practices, to get the scale [of data] he’s talking about – I just don’t think that’s true.”\n\nIn other words, all the machine-learning capabilities in the world won’t deliver better results if the data used to train and grow the algorithm is flawed or faulty.",
  "Illustration: Analytical Flavor Systems\n\nThe Gastrograph app also gathers data about the person doing the tasting –demographic information, socioeconomic status, past experience with the product, smoking habits and more – as well as information about the ambient environment, such as temperature, barometric pressure and noise levels, all of which can shade our experience of how things taste.",
  "Sensory scientists have long grappled with the problems that Analytical Flavor Systems claims to solve, Hayes says, and have developed and tested a sophisticated and evolving set of methodological and statistical instruments to improve the quality, reliability and functionality of the data they collect, including methods that combine descriptive evaluations with preference ratings.",
  "If the future is, as its founders say, in foods optimized to our most personal appetites, the company’s success will ultimately depend on the Gastrograph’s ability to tell food and beverage companies what you will love, the flavors that you won’t be able to live without – and to do this more accurately, efficiently, or cost-effectively than established companies.",
  "We are meeting at a swanky Australian coffee shop near the company’s office in the financial district – the kind of place that offers multiple single-origin pour-over options – so he can tell me about his artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Gastrograph, which he says can be used to map taste preferences with unprecedented ease and precision.",
  "The vaunted efficiencies of scale that allowed the industrial food production system to achieve its productivity and cheapness have also severed the connection people want to feel to the things they eat, leaving many consumers alienated from the huge multinational brands and agribusiness enterprises that provide many of our calories.",
  "Ultimately, flavor panels are thought to produce reliable, reproducible information about subjective flavor experiences – allowing companies to figure out how their grapefruit seltzer compares with other grapefruit seltzers, for instance, or determine whether an ingredient change will cause a noticeable alteration to its taste.",
  "They are going to develop products for national or international launch, and they literally cannot perceive what other demographics around the world perceive when they are tasting these products.”\n\nConventional sensory evaluation methods, according to Cohen, are both fundamentally flawed and fundamentally misguided.",
  "Essentially, AI describes any system that utilizes machine learning – computational algorithms, including neural networks and natural language processing – to churn meaning from aggregations of data, finding patterns, making predictions and, crucially, displaying the capacity for self-improvement.",
  "Critics of Cohen’s approach argue that an indiscriminate data gathering system doesn’t mean that groups of people won’t be excluded from its models, and that perhaps AI technology would be better applied to improving the quality of sensory data collected, rather than expanding the quantity.",
  "But the power of the Gastrograph AI lies in its ability to model and predict the flavor preferences of increasingly narrow slices of the consuming public, giving food and beverage companies the information they need to develop products optimized for more and more specific sensibilities.",
  "Just as targeted ads on Instagram or Facebook observe our online behavior to ever more precisely serve up what we seem to want, he predicts that food companies will one day match their products to our appetites, and use flavor to secure their place in our kitchens, and our hearts.",
  "Evidence of this can be seen across the marketplace: craft beer drinkers making room for lambics alongside their IPAs, Greek yogurt eaters checking out Icelandic skyr, and in the increasing popularity of grapefruit-flavored things, a flavor that neatly combines bitter and sour.",
  "Research groups such as IC FOODS at UC Davis – which counts Analytical Flavor Systems as a partner – are attempting to build an “internet of foods”, a standard, common set of data languages that can harness the maelstrom and turn it into computable, actionable knowledge.",
  "We would obviously never make a prediction for two competitors on each others’ products, but everyone’s data is going into improving the system.”\n\nTaken as a whole, the data collected by Gastrograph reveal large-scale patterns and emergent preferences.",
  "If we’re currently trapped in a system that fails to serve us because its vastness can’t acknowledge our real hungers, are we any less trapped by a system that tracks us down with the promise of our perfect chocolate bar, but only by subscription?",
  "They come here in the middle of snowstorms.”\n\nEach individual is trained using Compusense’s trademarked Feedback Calibration Method, which, Findlay explains, allows tasters to achieve exceptional precision in describing their flavor experiences.",
  "Ultimately, I cave and duly supply the kind of personal information that, in the age of Cambridge Analytica and ransomware, we’ve all grown more cautious about sharing: my race, ethnicity and gender; my birthday; my first language; my hometown.",
  "The Gastrograph would not merely suggest that a seltzer be grapefruit flavored, for instance, but how to tweak its floral, fruity, bitter and sour dimensions to captivate the fancy of north-eastern millennial guys, or German ladies over 40.",
  "Photograph: Analytical Flavor Systems\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, food scientists, chemists, home economists, consumer researchers and experimental psychologists forged a new discipline to address these questions: sensory science.",
  "“You can enter in a flavor profile for that latte,” Cohen says, pointing to my half-finished drink, “and the system will spit out an optimization – what to change to make it even better.” There is no platonic ideal of a latte, of course.",
  "“Precisely, their practice with taste panels reveals all the little nuisances that come with the evaluation of food,” she says, and their experimental techniques productively capture these uncertainties and the differences among tasters.",
  "Ultimately, what Analytical Flavor Systems is selling is not a food or beverage: it is a descriptive picture of experience, a predictive image of desire, and a vision of a food system fragmented into niches of highly attached consumers.",
  "Over the years, electronic noses, electronic tongues and other sensing devices have threatened to replace human tasters with automated machine equivalents, but for now the tasting panel remains the primary instrument of sensory science.",
  "Whether it’s our smart fridge’s silent sensors, our orders to Amazon Alexa or Siri, or the Instagram photos we post of our dinners, there’s more information out there about the food we eat, and how we feel about it, than ever before.",
  "By treating the trained tasters on panels as neutral instruments, who are expected to set aside their personal preferences and achieve consensus on matters of taste, sensory science denies the clear differences between people.",
  "It won’t help me figure myself out; instead, my data helps the AI refine its model of how people resembling me perceive the edible, quaffable world – which then, presumably, will help food companies design products to sell me.",
  "When tasters on a panel are “calibrated” to use a standardized language to describe their experiences, “you are literally throwing away data about the variations in perception in the broader underlying market,” Cohen says.",
  "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The efficiencies of scale that allowed the industrial food production system to achieve its productivity and cheapness have also severed the connection people want to feel to the things they eat.",
  "“We keep a pool of 30 panelists,” he told me – not full-time employees, but local Guelph, Ontario, residents who are chosen for specific projects (such as a recent six-week French fry study) and compensated for their time.",
  "I noticed that almost everyone who spoke to me about the virtues of personalized food made sure to also genuflect toward personalized nutrition – foods tailored to our peculiar metabolic needs or allergen sensitivities.",
  "In the Gastrograph-driven future that Analytical Flavor Systems envisions, we will each drink our own separate Cokes, exulting in a beverage optimized to be maximally delicious to our individual, irreconcilable palates.",
  "So there’s something undeniably alluring about a more personalized industrial food system, one that could take cultural and demographic differences into account, and that actually seems responsive to individual wishes.",

  "Eamonn Carey, managing director of Techstars Connection, an accelerator program that was an early supporter of Analytical Flavor Systems, calls personalization the “holy grail” for food and beverage companies.",
  "Many of the most notable companies are using AI to transform the big picture of food production: the farms, feedlots, factories, and other large-scale systems that make and distribute what we eat and drink.",
  "In 2010, Cohen began graduate work with Professor John Yen at Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology, where he built a basic AI platform that recorded tea information and tasting notes.",
  "The question is whether AI systems will be able to excel in the sensual, creative work of tasting and developing new foods – and what we stand to gain or lose by inventing foods that really have our number.",
  "Christopher Findlay is the chairman and founder of one of the world’s leading sensory consulting companies, Compusense, with a client roster that includes many of the top food, beverage, and flavor brands.",

  "Tools such as the Gastrograph, predicts Matthew Lange, IC Foods’ director, “will likely become part of the engine that drives this more ambient collection of food sensory experiences on a large scale”.",
  "The world of food and beverage manufacturing, Cohen says, is still oriented around “the predominant demographic”, the flavors of things tailored to please a coarse approximation of majority appetites.",
  "But where Moskowitz divided Americans into three groups – those who want their sauce plain, those who want it spicy, and those hungry for something chunky – Cohen imagines a much, much finer grind.",

  "Cohen left graduate school before completing his degree – in order to protect his intellectual property, he says – and devoted himself full-time to Analytical Flavor Systems beginning in 2013.",
  "A tea obsessive, Cohen was determined to find a way to determine whether a rare green tea was actually what it claimed to be, or calculate the changes to the taste of a pu-erh as it ages.",
  "And we hope to be the brain behind personalized products.”\n\nWhen compared with self-driving cars or Amazon’s Alexa, AI’s incursions into the food business have been notably less heralded.",
  "More recently, the technology has helped companies tweak the flavor profiles of a dozen new and forthcoming products, including craft beers, flavored waters, chocolates, and salty snacks.",

  "The primary users are trained sensory panels and product developers at food and beverage companies, who have supplied more than 200,000 reviews for the company’s main R&D database.",
  "“We think of flavor as an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,” he says, referring to the mathematical concept of a complex algebraic system with an infinite number of variables.",
  "But there’s obvious logistical challenges here, challenges that none of the people I spoke with at Analytical Flavor Systems or its backers managed to convincingly explain away.",
  "But however you crunch the numbers, launching a new food or beverage into the highly competitive US market is a perilous venture, one that’s expensive and fraught with hazards.",
  "Tasters map the contours of flavor perception by tracing the spokes corresponding to the qualities they detect, designating the intensity of each on a scale from one to five.",
  "So it’s a good time to ask: is a marketplace of proliferating varieties targeted to our private hungers, to our intimate biological needs, really one that serves us all best?",
  "And for all Cohen’s claims that his AI operates outside of the limits of sensory science, data still must enter the system in categories, which impose their own constraints.",
  "Ana María Ulloa, PhD, an anthropologist who studies sensory scientists at work, disagrees with Cohen that sensory scientists consider taste panels to be neutral instruments.",
