  "WESTWOOD: Right, minutes before it was supposed to start, aides didn't seem to know where it would be, when it would be, what kind of reporters would get to go if it was just the pool, if everyone who was present would be invited, it was really just sort of an ad hoc thing that the president seemed to have announced via Twitter after his staff had already put together a press briefing that 1:00 p.m., the exact same time.",
  "But I think the diGenova news was interesting for a few reasons, but it made me think about when Mike Pence was first announced, that the vice president, recall, there were a few hours where we didn't know if that was really going to happen because President Trump who was then a candidate obviously was allegedly upset about the leak that he was going to be picked his vice president.",
