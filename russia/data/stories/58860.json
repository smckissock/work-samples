  "We have been in office for less than six months and the caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which was created in part thanks to President Obama's withdrawal in 2011 from Iraq, we have only been in office for less than six months and thanks to the president's leadership, we are winning everywhere, but you wouldn't know it if you turned on CNN or read \"The New York Times.\"",
  "There's this bombshell from John Solomon that reveals more than half the memos the former FBI director, James Comey, wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have, in fact, been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents.",
  "And according to Politico's report, Ukrainian government officials tried to assist, aid, help Hillary Clinton in several ways by questioning then candidate Donald Trump's fitness for office, by assisting Clinton allies in their op research by putting out documents insinuating that the Ukrainian government was investigating a top Trump aide.",
  "And six months into this almost, five-and-a-half months into this administration, they should have already delivered on tax cuts, on infrastructure, and clearly on repealing \"Obama care\" and replacing it with something that's much more market-based that will bring down the cost of health care, all things that you've talked about.",
  "And as President Trump's legal team pointed out, they think that this meeting could have been a setup made to give the appearance of Russian collusion and that the person responsible for orchestrating all of this -- now, pay attention, this is, you're not going to hear this in the mainstream media -- is connected to Fusion GPS.",
  "According to an explosive new report from John Solomon -- he'll join us later -- the former FBI Director James Comey tonight could be in serious legal trouble and have committed several felonies because four of the seven memos about his conversations with President Trump did, in fact, contain classified information.",
  "And I think when you get away, for just a - - even a -- even a few days where you can think and you're not bombarded 24/7 with politics -- you actually talk to real people who have real lives that are separate from Washington and the Washington and New York axis, and you find out what's on their mind.",
  "And by the way, since everyone is talking about collusion, well, why did the media and Democrats freak out, why did they freak out over a story in January that had real evidence -- and by the way, you won't get this in any other mainstream media outlet, none of them will talk about this!",
  "HANNITY: Senator, I know that you work very close because I talked to all the Freedom Caucus guys, and you are literally up late at night talking to all the House Freedom Caucus members, all the disparate groups there, to try to get it done in a way that would also work in the Senate.",
  "And so what I am spending every waking moment doing right now is trying to bring together and unify Republicans, trying to bring together conservatives and moderates and leadership and the administration, get everyone on the same page and say let's deliver on the promise.",
  "Former fired FBI director James Comey is in deep trouble tonight just weeks after testifying under oath that the memos that he wrote and then later leaked about his conversations with President Trump were not government records and contained no classified information.",
  "Then of course the uranium one deal, pay to play, quid pro quo, where I grew up it's called bribery, and she got all of this money kicked back to the Clinton Foundation, and Vladimir Putin, Russia conspiracy, up to 20 percent of America's uranium reserves.",
  "And when we find out what agency let her in, we're going to know who's responsible for getting her in the country and putting her in the position to meet with Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nHANNITY: Well, don't we know that in was the Obama administration, John?",
  "And according to the same report, the FBI considers the memos that Comey made -- well, they happen to be government property, typed on a government computer in a government car, not personal documents, which is how Comey described them under oath.",
  "The deep state leaks are so bad that a recent Senate report found that they were happening at a rate of one a day through the end of May -- in other words, 125 leaks at least in 126 days, seven times more than the previous two administrations.",
  "I think there is clearly a lot of people that were working at once, and what overlays they have and what intersections they have, we don't know in part because Fusion GPS hasn't answered a lot of the questions that the Senate has put to them.",
  "Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ-Roll Call.",
  "Until we find out who was funding the dossier, until we find out who brought Natalia into the country, until we learn those sort of questions, we're not going to know the full picture, and I think it's too soon to make any assumptions.",
  "So the Christopher Steele dossier, which has been disreputable, which people have not been able to prove anything, that tried to connect, you know, Donald Trump to the Russians, was actually the company that this woman was working for.",
  "And if you actually do some research and read more than the headlines of these phony New York Times reports, well, which is what the media should be doing in the first place, you'll notice some massive holes that are in this story.",
  "JOHN SOLOMON, REPORTER, \"CIRCA NEWS\": I've covered about five or six presidential campaign, and every campaign someone walks into a Republican and Democratic campaign claiming to have information, and campaigns meet with them.",
  "Jay Sekulow, let me put up on the side of the screen lost potentially broken by James Comey, and I think some of these laws are the very same laws he let Hillary off the hook with, especially the Espionage Act, apply to her.",
  "And by the way, as Donald Trump, Jr., said in his statement, quote, \"The woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton.",
  "And the people that are pushing for that are the folks elected in the last five, six years, what I call the Young Turks that have consistently pressing, saying we have got a job to do and we have a short window of time.",
  "CRUZ: The particular letter you mentioned, I was in Obamacare negotiation so I didn't get a chance to sign the letter, but I very much agree with the sentiment that we need to stay here and do our job and get it done.",
  "And Ukrainian officials, government officials tried to help Hillary undermine Trump, questioning his fitness for office and also discussing documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption, and so on and so forth.",
  "But first, the mainstream media is once again foaming at the mouth, hysterically obsessing over Russia, Russia, Russia, while, of course, completely ignoring the millions of forgotten men and women in this country.",
  "Also tonight, there's another explosive new story from John Solomon and Sara Carter regarding the meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., and a Russian lawyer that's sending the media into a feeding frenzy yet again.",
  "The media, the deep state, the Democrats, the never Trumpers and frankly, lazy, spineless Republicans -- they are not giving a rip about enacting President Trump's agenda and they're working hard to stop it.",
  "And the report adds that a DNC operative even met with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in D.C. to discuss ways to expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ties to the country.",
  "The groups we've been telling you about, the destroy Trump media, the obstructionist Democrats, the deep state, never-Trumpers, lazy Republicans are all doing this because they don't like how you voted!",
  "Natalia Veselnitskaya -- she was the attorney that Donald Trump, Jr., met with -- was actually connected to a company called Presevan (ph) Holding, which was run by a Russian named Dennis Katzik (ph).",
  "Joining us now, Circa News Sara Carter, the executive vice president at The Hill, John Solomon, the attorney for President Trump, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow.",
  "HANNITY: I -- I -- the idea that they have, like, less than -- like, about 30 days left in the legislative calendar in the next six months -- who -- do you even have -- do you have time to eat lunch?",
  "So before we continue, I want to remind you, the American people, what this country needs to get done and sooner rather than later and what the media needs to focus on, even though they never will.",
  "We need to stop -- look at the situation in North Korea, a clear and present danger to the entire world, of course, thanks to Bill Clinton's 1990s bribes to the rogue regime and then being played.",
  "And Lynch, by the way, also pressured James Comey to call the investigation into Clinton's server -- \"don't call it investigation, call it a matter,\" which is what the Clinton campaign wanted.",
  "I know the Freedom Caucus in the House, and a group of senators tonight put out a letter to Mitch McConnell -- because you only have 30 legislative days left in the year, for crying out loud.",
  "You, the American people, the people that went to the polls in November, the forgotten men and women that have been left behind -- you're now caught in a crossfire, an ideological crossfire.",
  "And number two is, of course, the media who you rightly called deranged for their obsession with issues that most Americans think -- you know, they're important, but they're not everything.",
  "Let's start, Jay, with you on the issue of 18 U.S. code 641, the Records Act, government property leaked to The New York Times, 18 U.S. Code 793, the Espionage Act, classified information.",
  "And more importantly, at the bottom of that, on the foundation of that, they don't care about the millions and millions of forgotten men, forgotten women that this last election was about.",
  "And according to The Washington Times, Christopher Steele said in a court filing that that dossier was never supposed to be made public and that BuzzFeed should never have published it.",
  "And how does that play out with the meeting that she held with Donald Trump, Jr., which he said he did not know prior to that meeting exactly who she was and what she was representing.",
  "Is that coupled with this dossier that was put together -- are those two examples of foreign governments working with the Clinton campaign to influence the outcome of an election?",
  "Now, as John Solomon and Sara Carter reported over the weekend, this lawyer was denied a visa, but eventually was allowed into the country, by the way, under President Obama.",
  "And you can't focus 24/7 on those issues to the exclusion of health care and economic recovery and the good things that have already occurred under the Trump administration.",
  "And also tonight --\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTERRENCE WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: And I would rather die than live to see CNN for the rest of my life with a one star in the Apple store.",
  "Now as I said at the top of the show tonight, Republican lawmakers, they need to cancel their August recess, roll up their sleeves, start working on the president's agenda.",
  "The Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat says he, quote, absolutely wants to hear from Donald Trump Jr. about a meeting he had last year with the Russian lawyer.",
  "How do you take out North Korea's nuclear sites and do it effectively when they have nuclear weapons that could hit Seoul and Japan and even China if the guys that nuts?",
  "But they do have -- you know, I got to say I've been to the Senate dining room a few times because there are actually a few senators who are trying to get things done.",
  "Democrats, members of the destroy Trump media have now for months been lying, smearing, slandering, trying to delegitimize the president, stop him from doing his job.",
  "All right, once again, the destroy Trump media has worked itself into a frenzy over a meeting that Donald Trump, Jr., had back in June of 2016 with a Russian lawyer.",
  "We've only heard about Russia, Russia, Russia, but many other countries had an interest in this election, and we don't know who they helped or what they did to help.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Terrence Williams, a conservative comic that is a social media sensation gets the last word on HANNITY tonight as we continue.",
  "HANNITY: Baghdadi, we have an author on who said in fact they had a chance to take Baghdadi out, but because of Obama rules of engagement they didn't take the shot.",
  "He went to his government computer, put them into a memo form, put them in his government desk for when he needed them after he gets fired, and then releases them.",
  "Here we know Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information, top-secret information, special access program information, and she also destroyed some of those.",
  "HANNITY: As we continue tonight on \"Hannity\" with reaction to all this breaking news out of Washington, we continue with Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow.",
  "Now, we know real felonies, real crimes were committed, again, things the mainstream media will not report or tell you if it doesn't have the word Russia in it.",
  "No desire do they have in the media, all these groups, to get the country moving in a direction that will help every person that went to the polls in November.",
  "James Comey illegally leaked government information to a third party, ultimately to The New York Times, for one purpose, and that was to get a special counsel.",
  "Well, of course now, we can never allow them to get nuclear weapons despite the billions Obama gave them and the right to continue to spin their centrifuges.",
  "That's a big, big deal because it lets you use pretax dollars, which means for a lot of taxpayers, the cost of their premiums drop 20-30 percent instantly.",
  "It says if a health insurance company sells at least one plan consistent with the title one mandates, that it can also sell any other plan consumers want.",
  "I've had tier one operators from our special operations forces tell me, I've had commanders, they felt it in the first three weeks after the inauguration.",
  "The consumer freedom option is an amendment I've written that says you, the consumer, you have the right to choose what health insurance you want to buy.",
  "Not to mention, if this lawyer was such a threat and a Russian agent or a spy, then why did the Obama administration let her into this country in 2016?",
  "And by the way, as The New York Post has reported, Fusion GPS has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies and even Planned Parenthood.",
  "Number one, the lawyer who Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner met with didn't work for the Russian government at the time of the meeting.",
  "They need to cancel their August recess, stay, working like the rest of America in Washington to fulfill the promises they made to all of us here.",
  "If you people can't get health care done, get the wall funded, the economy moving, a new budget plan passed, you are failing the American people!",
  "And of course, tonight, Comey's friend is denying that the memos that he was given contained classified information at the time he received them.",
  "If we come together, enact common sense reforms, more competition, more choices, more options, and we lower premiums, that's a win for everyone.",
  "The west became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: President Trump last week in Warsaw in Poland, showing the world that leading from the front, it looks a lot better.",
  "You got the Democrats, you got CNN, The New York Times, you got NBC, The Washington Post -- they don't give a rip about the president's agenda!",
  "And Sean, this was designed to be a compromise that conservatives and moderates could come together, because you are not taking away anything.",
  "ObamaCare -- let's see, it's been promised by Republicans in 2010, 2014, 2016 and now they're saying they're not sure they can get it done?",
  "Now, the two big stories we're following tonight, first, the destroy Trump media's Russia psychosis is now back, and it's worse than ever.",
  "And it is stunning, number one, that we have Republicans who refuse to produce results for the Trump agenda that won a historic election.",
  "And I don't think there's anything particularly remarkable that someone might walk into Trump Tower offering dirt on the Hillary Clinton.",
  "What we do know is that they are all these pieces of evidence laid out and that those pieces of evidence are going to start unraveling.",
  "The biggest reason so many millions of people are so unhappy with Obamacare and hurting so badly is that it's made premiums skyrocket.",
  "I think Americans are extremely upset and enraged that Mitch McConnell cannot deliver a bill to the president's desk that he can sign.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS: And I would rather die than live to see CNN for the rest of my life with a one star in the Apple store.",
  "How does anybody in the Republican Party expect to get reelected if they can't do this one fundamental thing that they all promised?",
  "In other words, this whole meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. -- is this a very different story than the American people are being told?",
  "Virginia Senator Mark Warner calls it the first clear evidence of senior level members of the Trump campaign meeting with Russians.",
  "Now, the press is running wild, all types of black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories about Russian collusion once again.",
  "Clinton as secretary of state gave, handed up to 20 percent of America's uranium -- you want to talk about a Russia conspiracy?",
  "That is the op research firm that produced the fake Christopher Steele dossier -- remember the British spy -- on Donald Trump.",
  "When it comes to Obamacare, the most important thing, Sean, the way we unify Republicans is let's focus on lowering premiums.",
  "Over the weekend Senator Ted Cruz said failure is not an option, and that he believes that health care can in fact get done.",
  "We're going to point out the hypocrisy and tell you how the media has an agenda that's not to help you, the American people.",
  "The Clinton Foundation and other issues related to the Clinton Foundation, so we don't know what the FBI is looking at now.",
  "Laura Ingraham, Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow, Senator Ted Cruz and Dr. Sebastian Gorka, will all be here tonight.",
  "HANNITY: All right, coming up, Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow join us with reaction to the big breaking news today.",
  "For seven years Republicans have promised the voters if you elect thus, the one thing we said is we will repeal Obamacare.",
  "There are a bunch of us, myself included, that have been urging leadership back from January, let's not take any recesses.",
  "Maybe they should focus on Hillary and her campaign working with the Ukrainians directly, proven, no ambiguity, collusion.",
  "And coming up, President Trump while in Warsaw last week showed the world what leading from the front actually looks like.",
  "I'll tell you, the president, the vice president, the administration are strongly supporting the consumer freedom option.",
  "HANNITY: Would any other presidential campaign, John Heilemann tweeted out today, oh, I've never heard about this before.",
  "Now, the story goes on to talk about that this wasn't the only campaign that was boosted by a former Soviet bloc country.",
  "And we have the opportunity to do that on radio every day because we talk to people three hours a day, five days a week.",
  "So what it all boils down to, what we're now living through is a massive, huge double standard, selective moral outrage.",
  "I decided to invite him all week on the program so he gets the last word, every night this week, I think you'll like it.",
  "And thousands of hours of coverage, and I'm looking at North Korea, they have nuclear weapons because of the Clintons.",
  "But the truth of the matter is this is part of the normal process of the dirty political system that we live in today.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: At Warsaw President Trump showed the world that leading from the front, what it looks like.",
  "We need to get Americans back to work, Americans off of food stamps, Americans out of poverty, Americans buying homes.",
  "Remember the Columbia professor who leaked it to the New York Times on his behalf because he wanted a special counsel.",
  "That's -- I mean, I don't see how you can keep your job as Senate majority leader...\n\nHANNITY: They don't deserve to!",
  "On the contrary, if they wanted to find about Russian influence in American politics, look at John Podesta's company.",
  "And I think the voters would naturally say to heck with all of you if we can't get our act together and get it done.",
  "Elizabeth Warren's putting out the call to mobilize against the Republicans in this critical week, two- week period.",
  "Number two, he leaked that information for one purpose only, and that was to obtain a special counsel, which he did.",
  "So James Comey -- we now know, by the way, he didn't just leak one memo but four that he sent to this law professor.",
  "They hate this president so much and want him to fail, they'll do anything they can to get him thrown out of office.",
  "Hillary Clinton mishandled and destroyed top-secret classified special program information, government information.",
  "For people that want all the bells and whistles, all the mandates, the full Cadillac plan, those are still offered.",
  "If these guys fail, they will pay a price so large that they seem to have no clue about what the backlash will be.",
  "And also tonight, there's another example that does expose the destroy Trump media and the Democrats' real agenda.",
  "No, and not -- you wouldn't -- you wouldn't be able to keep your job in corporate America with this track record.",
  "So last month we showed you a hilarious video from the Twitter sensation conservative comedian Terrence Williams.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters I'm Kelly Wright.",
  "SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Yes, I think there's a story here that people aren't getting from the mainstream media.",
  "They are purposely ignoring the real scandals that now exist, real crimes committed, real collusion that occurs.",
  "It just shows just how abusively biased, agenda-driven these so-called rigid, radical left-wing ideologues are.",
  "\"Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.\"",
  "Dr. Gorka, I am on vacation and then I'm watching the latest phony Russia conspiracy theory now being advanced.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Conservative Twitter sensation Terrence Williams, he gets the last word.",
  "I think the most important question to answer today is who allowed that Russian lawyer into the United States?",
  "INGRAHAM: In the make-up room, I just had a couple of oatmeal cookies that Debbie (ph), the make-up lady, has.",
  "So once again, another one of the destroy Trump media's Russia collusion conspiracy theories is falling apart.",
  "And by the way, on top of all of this, another massive scandal the Democrats and the media are glossing over.",
  "To the media, to all these groups, the deep state, Democrats, weak Republicans it's all a big game of gotcha.",
  "There's no coverage of any of this because of the obsessive-compulsive desire to stop the president's agenda.",
  "HANNITY: Do you believe that this was a setup by the DNC and this Fusion group that we're are talking about?",
  "And also later tonight...\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But hey, Sean, let's talk about fake news.",

  "Just the authorized disclosure in and of itself would be a violation of the law, and in my view, a felony.",
  "He'll update us on the Senate's attempt to repeal and replace \"Obama care,\" all that, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.",
  "I'm like, just read \"Politico\" in January of 2017 about the Ukrainians working with the Clinton campaign.",
  "Dense terrain and powerful explosives from the wreckage are hampering the search for possible survivors.",
  "It's also time Republicans keep the promises they made, especially on repealing and replacing Obamacare.",
  "In the meantime, let's look at what the media should be reporting if they weren't politically motivated.",
  "And so we ought to stop taking recesses, stop taking time off and just keep going until we get it done.",
  "So I am really surprised -- not by you but by other senators saying we are not going to get this done.",
  "And I would rather die than listen to CNN for the rest of my life with a one star in the Apple store.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nWILLIAMS: How do you all have one star in the Apple store and you claim you are the best?",
  "GORKA: When it comes to rules of engagement, that's another massive story that isn't being reported.",
  "And we know it happened with Hillary's campaign, and the DNC actually was working with these people.",
  "The second big piece, and really the knob of the battle right now is the consumer freedom option.",
  "And we don't want to see those bad guys come to the streets of America as we have seen in Europe.",
  "In the meantime, what about the real story --\n\nHANNITY: The uranium deal or the Uranium One deal?",

  "But you look at the law and you look at the facts and this is not hard to put together.",
  "DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: You are absolutely right, Sean.",

  "HANNITY: All right, Sara Carter, let's go to you and your reporting along with John.",
  "He says failure is not an option when it comes to repealing, replacing \"Obama care.\"",

  "Sometimes they act on it, sometimes, in this case it appears they didn't act on it.",
  "I suspect you don't want to go on vacation, but I didn't see your name on the list.",
  "But of course, they are completely missing many of the key facts about this story.",
  "HANNITY: And John, I want to juxtapose this to another story that Politico broke.",
  "If you have to work 14 hours a day, seven days a week like most Americans, do it!",

  "Here with reaction, deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.",
  "The Obama administration did to their due diligence to investigate Russia.",
