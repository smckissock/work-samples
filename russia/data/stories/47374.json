  "Here’s a transcript of the exchange:\n\nTed Cruz: “As CEO, have you ever made hiring or firing decisions based on political positions or what candidates [employees] supported?”\n\nMark Zuckerberg: “No.”\n\nCruz: “Why was Palmer Luckey fired?”\n\nZuckerberg: “That is a specific personnel matter that seems like it would be inappropriate to speak to here.”\n\nCruz: “You just made a specific representation that you didn’t make decisions based on political views.",
  "That was among several political controversies that has engulfed Facebook over the past few months and years, including Russian electoral interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the latter of which landed Zuckerberg in the hot seat this week.",
  "However, Luckey and Facebook parted ways last year after it was revealed that he was quietly funding efforts attacking Hillary Clinton and supporting Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",
