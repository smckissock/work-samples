  "REUTERS/Alaa Al-Faqir The\"cessation of hostilities\" agreement comes a day after Saudi Arabia announced it had made a \"final decision\" to send troops into Syria to help fight ISIS, which prompted Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to say that further foreign intervention in Syria could lead to \"a new world war.\"",
  "David Butter, an associate fellow at the Chatham House Middle East and North Africa Programme, told Business Insider in an email that \"Russia seems to be driving the show at the moment, and it appears that it wants to give the impression that it is being helpful on the humanitarian side.\"",

  "Institute for the Study of War \"At the very least, I think there's a good chance that fighting is limited sufficiently to allow humanitarian supplies into areas under siege, reducing the prospects of widespread famine and disease,\" Bremmer told Business Insider.",
  "\"There have been so many atrocities committed by Assad's regime, by the rebels, and by ISIS; and international actors are very far apart on what could be an acceptable starting point, never mind end point, on a political settlement,\" Bremmer said.",
  "\"IS not really a priority for Russia at the moment, but all of the external actors seem to sense that IS is weakening in Iraq and Syria, and they are jockeying for position so as to take credit for its ultimate defeat,\" Butter said.",

  "Recent events \"...really showed there was another impending humanitarian crisis in Syria... and made everyone realise that [the conflict] could completely spiral out of control,\" Barnes-Dacey said.",
  "The main takeaway from the deal sealed by the foreign ministers from the International Syria Support Group is that more help will be delivered more quickly to besieged cities and regions in Syria.",
  "The onslaught by Russian-backed government forces on Aleppo forced an estimated 50,000 people to flee the city and has reportedly killed 500 people since the start of the offensive on February 1.",
