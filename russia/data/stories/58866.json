  "The idea that the president of the United States is seen as a child who can either be used or manipulated by those who have agendas or who is completely incompetent and incapable of doing his job is actually frightening because it's exactly what we heard during the campaign and if this book is to be believed, and I think it is credible, then it is actually quite frightening for the American people.",
  "I'm sorry, but the only reason anyone wants him to hang around is so that Bob Mueller won't be fired in his absence because you'll have a non-recused A.G.\n\nDANIELLE PLETKA:I think the argument that he is Roy Cohn is just a good for Eric Holder.CHUCK TODD:All right, unfortunately, I am past time, but they'll continue this debate, as soon as we’re done.",
  "JOY-ANN REID:But can I just say that this is, you know, the war on drugs, particularly the war on weed, has disproportionately destroyed the lives of particularly African Americans and Latinos in this country, who ironically are going to be doubly pursued now, thanks to Jeff Sessions, who isn't exactly a friend to these communities.",
  "But the guy who was in charge of the Clinton email investigation was fired by Mr. Mueller because we discovered emails between Mr. Strzok and Miss Lace, who was ---\n\nCHUCK TODD: By the way, doesn't that make you feel better about Mr. Mueller, that he fired him before anybody brought it up --\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Oh it does, it does.",
  "I mean, Steve Bannon, and I was told by Sam Nunberg who's known Donald Trump a long time, that part of the reason that they didn't mind Michael Wolff being there is that he seemed to be in the axis of Bannon and Roger Ailes, and so they trusted that he was going to do something positive about them.",
  "And then those same people are locked out of the industry as it's being legalized for affluent, namely white Americans, who can then go in, cash rich from California, into places like where I grew up, Denver, start businesses with the cash that they've gotten from Silicon Valley, et cetera.",
  "If you're not worried about Mr. Strzok being in charge of the Clinton email investigation, given his attitude toward the Clintons and Trump and what he said, then I think you're blind to the fact that this whole, this whole investigation needs to be looked at independently.",
  "The Sessions thing is interesting to me because you've got all these people in Trump world, like Sessions, like Lindsey Graham, who are trying to do something good for the country, or what they believe is good for the country, and they're stuck working with this guy Trump.",
  "And you have Jeff Sessions who's now willing to be his Roy Cohn, pursuing investigations of his former political opponent, willing to turn the Justice Department into a wholly politicized outfit that is essentially being there to mollify the ego and needs of Donald Trump.",
  "The idea that people who have agendas, people like Steve Bannon, by the way, who just saw Trump as a pure vehicle, that it doesn't matter what Donald Trump does, they could lock him in his room with a cheeseburger and his bed all day, and they can do whatever they want.",
  "Joining me for insight and analysis are David Brooks, columnist for The New York Times; Joy Reid, host of AM Joy on MSNBC; Mark Leibovich, chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine; and Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute.",
  "But the weird thing about this White House, there's the child insane level, but then this same week, they did an offshore drilling policy change, they did a Pakistan policy change, they're doing marijuana, they're doing DACA, they're doing Iran.",
  "So my goal was to keep going until somebody said, “Go away.”\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBut in the initial premise of the book, were you overly flattering or were you promising that this book would be more flattering than than maybe it turned out to be?",
  "MICHAEL WOLFF:\n\nJohn Kelly said, was, was questioned about these, these wackadoo tweets, and he said, “Oh, I didn’t see them.” I’m going to just say, “Like hell he didn’t see them.” And that’s what goes on in the White House all the time.",
  "I mean one of the things, I think, about this book and why it’s hit such a chord and become this cultural moment is it’s given everybody this focused opportunity to say, “Holy crap.”\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nMichael Wolff, I will leave it there.",
  "I want a special counsel to look at not only how Mr. Steele conducted himself, what the FBI did with the dossier, whether Mr. Ohr, who's wife worked for Fusion GPS alongside Mr. Steele, what involvement did he have in the dossier.",

  "Here’s something you wrote in 2017, in January, so: \"To the media, it is a given that Trump is largely out of control and that the people around him are struggling at all times to save him from himself--and largely failing.",
  "During the time that Mr. Steele was being an informant for the FBI, we now know he was shopping the dossier to out--journalist outlets all over the world, which is inconsistent, in my view, with being a reliable informant.",
  "And then that means that agendas that were not voted for by, you know, the majority of the American people, that were not...these are not people who are accountable to the American people, can literally do what they want.",
  "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If after having been briefed by our intelligence leaders, Donald Trump is still unsure as to what the Russians did, that would be incredibly unnerving to me because the evidence is overwhelming.",
  "If after the briefing, he is still unsure, that will shake me to my core about his judgement\n\n[END TAPE]\n\nCHUCK TODD: Senator Graham, just yesterday the president, again, referred to the Russia investigation as a hoax.",
  "And part of it is what Michael Wolff has said and will say again I'm sure is that this is exactly how people around him, or many people around him at the White House, certainly Republicans on the Hill speak privately.",
  "In 2017, the percentage of the population that was actively seeking a job was actually down marginally and that was even with all of the good news about the economy, which should have lured more of these workers back.",
  "\"From all credible accounts, Steele is a solid guys, who was so worried that America's enemy, Putin, had compromising info on Trump that he exposed himself to risk to bring it to the attention of US law enforcement.",
  "Now, in addition to the move on the marijuana industry, the Trump administration also opened up offshore drilling, including in states that don't want it, even like Florida, where his buddy Rick Scott pushed back.",
  "And because you have a White House that is what it is, with a president that is who Michael Wolff has described him to be, it frees this attorney general to pursue those obsessions to whatever degree he wants.",
  "Because I think that if Donald Trump is also impaired, because I think some of the most frightening revelations were about the potential that Donald Trump is not in full possession of his cognitive faculties.",
  "And I don't think that there is much argument that it is very harmful to certain people that can sit around, not work, and have access to drugs legally that perhaps are going to make their fate even worse.",
  "I mean, what if they just decided they have the same pet issue as Jeff Sessions does, and then all of a sudden you have these cause celebs popping up all over the place who are in grave criminal jeopardy?",
  "“Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.” So then I went around and so it was basically me saying, “The president says this is, this is - he likes this idea.” Um, and then everyone would say, “Oh, okay, great, sit down.",
  "I said, “No, no, I’d really like to do this.” And then he named a couple of other authors, who he knew, who he said, “Oh, yeah, they’d like to do this too.” And I said, but, you know, is it, is it okay?",
  "The tell-all book portrays a dysfunctional White House led by a president of declining intellectual capacity and a staff that didn't believe Mr. Trump would win the election or necessarily should have.",
  "I mean, Donald Trump is sort of “Oh, yeah, yeah.” And I said to him, I said, “Listen, I would like to do a book.” And I remember because I remember he seemed deflated, a book, who cares about a book?",
  "CHUCK TODD:Okay, but the White House - tell us - has said the last time that they have a record of you speaking to him was in February of 2017, which is not even through the first hundred days.",
  "Then again, Democrats are always for states' rights when the Republicans run the federal government, and the Republicans love states' rights when the Democrats run the federal government.",
  "But I think, you know, what you're seeing out of the Justice Department is the answer to the question of why Jeff Sessions puts up with the ritual humiliation of himself by Donald Trump.",
  "MICHAEL WOLFF:You know, I have spoken to the president, as I've said, I've spoken to the president for about three hours through the length of the campaign up until I finished the book.",
  "In addition to the president, the other protagonist in the book is his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has now been excommunicated by Mr. Trump for his disloyalty, for now.",
  "And I want to know did this FBI agent feel like he had to take the law in his own hands and create an insurance policy against an outcome of an election that he may not have liked.",
  "But still, Joy Reid, I thought the most fascinating thing about the pot decision with Jeff Sessions is I have yet to see a single Republican elected official praise the decision.",
  "He said in response to the lawsuit that he didn't give the document to Buzzfeed but he did give it to journalists throughout the world, talked about the contents of the dossier.",
  "And I want to find out if the lead investigator of the Clinton email investigation had a political bias against Trump for Clinton to the point that it was a sham investigation.",
  "With a president described by his own staff as “an idiot surrounded by clowns,” “a (BLEEP) fool” with a staff that questioned his “fitness for office” and his mental stability.",
  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:Complete fantasy, disgraceful and laughable.SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:It's mistake after mistake after mistake.SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:A book full of lies.",
  "Meaning that the assumption was “Yeah, you can talk to Michael Wolff.” We’ve - meaning the president - was it the assumption was you were blessed, it was okay to talk to you?",
  "The winter bomb cyclone that hit Washington this week had nothing to do with the frigid weather and everything to do with the book Fire and Fury by journalist Michael Wolff.",
  "Michael Wolff will be back tomorrow for his first cable interview on Morning Joe and then he'll join Lawrence O'Donnell on The Last Word at 10:00 p.m. Eastern both on MSNBC.",
  "And so the insanity is there, but we shouldn't reduce it to a fairytale, the madness of King George, because there is a policy process that's going on in this White House.",
  "On Friday, Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina issued what's called a \"criminal referral\" of Christopher Steele to the Justice Department.",
  "CHUCK TODD:\n\nBut by day five, the president clearly not satisfied with defending his own fitness for office, calling himself a \"genius\" and a \"very stable genius\" at that.",
  "Like if people said positive things about him, um, I’m not saying- that you left it out because it took away from the thesis of the book that you wanted to get out there?",
  "This is a White House that from everything that I understand about it is completely disorganized and especially in the period when Michael Wolff says that he was there.",
  "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, the president does now finally believe that the Russians stole the emails from the DNC and hacked -- and Clinton --\n\nCHUCK TODD: He does?",
  "We're gonna let Mr. Mueller tell us whether or not this campaign colluded with the Russians and I will do everything I can to make sure that Mr. Mueller does his job.",
  "CHUCK TODD: Senator, you are painting, you are painting a picture of a lawless Department of Justice and a lawless F.B.I., totally filled with political partisanship.",
  "But there's other things about the Department of Justice and this investigation that bother me greatly and I think we need a special counsel to look at those things.",
  "(END TAPE)\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAnd the author of that bombshell new book joins me now, Michael Wolff, welcome to “Meet the Press.”\n\nMICHAEL WOLFF:\n\nChuck, glad to be here.",
  "There were actually more jobs created in 2016, President Obama's last year in office, over 2.2 million, than in 2017, President Trump's first year, about 2 million.",
  "MICHAEL WOLFF:\n\nYes, actually, they would say, sort of in the mid-period, “We’re not at a 25th Amendment level yet.” Or they would-\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThat’s alarming.",
  "MICHAEL WOLFF:You know, somebody said to me about the children, somebody who knows them well, and the phrase was, \"They are tolerant, but they have no illusions.\"",
  "And then the very black and brown people who've been thrown into prison for selling the exact same drug come out and can't even get a license to sell it legally.",
  "CHUCK TODD:\n\nA White House torn apart by infighting and a president isolated, losing allies, with staffers desperately trying to contain what he might do or say.",
  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:\n\nFurious, disgusted would probably certainly fit when you make such outrageous claims and completely false claims against the president.",
  "Nobody sits on a couch at the White House for hours on end, just listening to what everybody says, because no one's talking near the couches on the White House.",
  "And I think there are a lot of people I've spoken to who know Trump and who work with Trump who do exactly, who think exactly the way he says everybody thinks.",
  "There's a bunch of stuff about the Department of Justice, how they conducted themselves, that need to be looked at just as much as Trump needs to be looked at.",
  "CHUCK TODD:\n\nOn the president's first full day back in Washington, he attacked his own Justice Department as the deep state, one of 17 tweets on Tuesday alone.",
  "Federal prosecutors now can use their own discretion in deciding whether, and how, to enforce anti-pot laws in states where it's legal to grow, buy, and sell.",
  "We did some research and found that throughout his career, Donald Trump has threatened 30 media-related lawsuits, but has only actually filed suit four times.",
  "\"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office, that there's no way he gets election, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk.",

  "This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions did away with the hands-off approach in enforcing federal marijuana laws in states where it's been legalized.",
  "\"So the president wants a book banned, he wants a political opponent in jail,\" referring to Huma Abedin, \"and for good measure, maybe the former F.B.I.",
  "And later, why has the Justice Department decided to allow prosecutors to go after people who grow and sell marijuana in states where pot is now legal?",
  "And the thing that keeps everybody’s attention absolutely riveted - this global attention - is that the train keeps going, but the wall is still there.",
  "I imagine now you’ve got every author in America hoping they, too, will have a president threaten a lawsuit for them in order to help with book sales.",
  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:\n\nAgain, it is absolutely laughable to think that somebody like this president would run for office with the purpose of losing.",
  "In Fire and Fury, Bannon describes the June 2016 meeting with the Russians, hosted by the president's son, Don Jr., as \"unpatriotic” and “treasonous.\"",
  "People who have A) no experience, but also on any organizational level, I mean, that meant that they were the family, they could overrule everything.",
  "When we come back, End Game, and why is it that Attorney General Jeff Sessions suddenly is so interested in threatening the legal marijuana business?",
  "The president sort of joked with you the other day and he said, \"Boy, Lindsey used to be a great enemy of mine, and now he's a great friend of mine.\"",
  "In other words, the two Republican Senators are asking for an investigation of a man, who many believe was simply trying to expose Russian meddling.",
  "Even before President Trump was inaugurated, Republicans promised to get to the bottom of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election.",
  "And I don't think we want to be unfair in suggesting that everything normal that happens in the White House has absolutely nothing to do with him.",
  "But in truth, the jobs numbers from 2017 look more like a continuation of the recovery trends set in recent years than a new or better direction.",
  "There's the other strain that thinks that drugs are corrosive influence, and they are, in fact, harming the very communities that you talk about.",
  "Now, if you were to ask, probably I would say 80% of elected Republicans on the Hill, \"What do you think of the president's fitness for office?\"",
  "But I think that what you said, Chuck, about the president's reaction to the book, is what has elevated it from being basically tabloid fodder.",
  "CHUCK TODD:Except Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, who want him to resign, two key members of the Freedom [Caucus], and I know it's Russia related.",
  "I believe there's plenty of evidence that the Russians interacted with the Trump campaign and Mr. Mueller's going to get to the bottom of it.",
  "He's president of the United States, going to make a decision about North Korea, which is one of the biggest threats to the world at large.",
  "And one of the issues here was that they kept saying, I kept setting up this thing, and then they kept saying, \"Can we have the questions?\"",
  "This view persists … despite Trump's victory flattening almost every media assumption about his supposed haplessness and lack of strategy.\"",
  "And then this went on, “Okay, this is a little 25th Amendment.” So 25th Amendment is a concept that is alive every day in the White House.",

  "But what about the jobs President Trump promised voters he'd bring back during his campaign, specifically manufacturing and coal mining?",
  "A lot of, a lot of your friends have been asking me that, going, \"Hey, ask the senator why he's suddenly cozying up to President Trump.\"",

  "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:The fact that there was a claim that the president didn't know who John Boehner was is pretty ridiculous.",

  "I mean, is this a fair critique that his reaction to this book only reinforces the point Michael Wolff is making?",
  "CHUCK TODD:\n\nYou know, it's though the president's reaction to the book is reinforcing some of these narratives.",
