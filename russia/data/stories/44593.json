  "He raised wanting to leave before the 2016 election but agreed to stay at the request of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the company said.",
  "“Leading policy and communications for hyper growth technology companies is a joy - but it’s also intense and leaves little room for much else,” Schrage said in a post on Facebook.",
