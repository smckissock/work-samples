  "There, in an anonymous committee room, Vickery, who works for the data security company UpGuard, told the select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) how he had stumbled across a data breach online: an unsecured repository of source code left online by AggregateIQ, the company employed by the official Vote Leave campaign that we reported a year ago was Cambridge Analytica’s Canadian affiliate.",
  "The Observer and its sister paper the Guardian have been on Cambridge Analytica’s heels for most of that short history – from the first piece in the Guardian in December 2015, to its first mention in the Observer in December 2016, to the article in February 2017 that revealed the central role in the company of Robert Mercer, the US data billionaire and supporter of rightwing causes.",
  "The chair of the committee added: “Something doesn’t smell right here.”\n\nLast Thursday, the Canadian committee asked the head of the UK’s DCMS committee, Damian Collins, to give evidence by Skype, and another Canadian MP, Frank Baylis, told him the referendum groups were “actively coordinating” and that “there was a series of coincidences that defy logic”.",
  "And it was this investigation that led to the ICO announcing a wider inquiry into the use of data in politics: an inquiry that reached a dramatic culmination when the ICO raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices in the week that the Observer published revelations from Christopher Wylie, a former employee turned whistleblower.",
  "It’s unclear what data or intellectual property has been transferred to a new Mercer-funded vehicle, Emerdata, whose directors include all the main individuals involved in Cambridge Analytica – Mercer’s daughter Rebekah Mercer; Alexander Tayler, CA’s chief data officer; and Julian Wheatland, its chairman, among them.",
  "Since we published Wylie’s firsthand account on 17 March and Facebook subsequently confirmed that as many as 87 million people may have had their personal information improperly harvested on Cambridge Analytica’s behalf, we have also learned that hundreds, maybe thousands, of other app developers did the same.",
  "It’s not the end of the road for the company, or the investigations into it, but it is a remarkable moment in Cambridge Analytica’s short and eventful life – the zenith of which was helping Donald Trump become US president only 18 months ago – and in the Observer’s involvement in it.",
  "It was this article that triggered two investigations, both of which continue: one by the Electoral Commission into whether it had done work – that was not declared – for the Brexit campaign Leave.EU, the other by the Information Commissioner’s Office.",
  "Trump has called the press “the enemy of the American people” but what we found was that Mercer and Steve Bannon, the key Trump aide who became his chief strategist, were waging a war on facts, on the mainstream media, on multiple fronts.",
  "That certainly does not mean that it is not going to happen any more – across large swaths of the world, it is only just beginning – but the collapse of Cambridge Analytica marks the end of the age of data innocence, as Wylie has said.",
  "A crime that is beyond the powers of the Electoral Commission to investigate, that happened outside British jurisdiction, and was enabled by a company – Facebook – whose head has refused, repeatedly, to answer questions to parliament.",
  "And Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are in it, intimately bound in an embrace that encompasses two of the greatest political upheavals since the second world war – Britain’s decision to exit the EU and the election of Donald Trump.",
  "The code has tangible proof of almost everything we reported then – things that Cambridge Analytica had denied in long and detailed legal letters, and that had been saved by Vickery on to a hard drive and handed over to parliament.",
  "It was not the first piece we had published about the company – the lawyers cited six previous ones – but it was our article on 7 May, “The Great British Brexit Robbery”, that prompted the “pre-action protocol for defamation”.",
  "How do you combat articles that have no basis in fact but which – as Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told an undercover reporter for Channel 4 – can be made to “infect the bloodstream of the internet”?",
  "Legal threats from Cambridge Analytica, which is funded by Mercer – the man who heads the most lucrative hedge fund in the world, and who was Trump’s biggest donor – have hung over both the paper and me personally.",
  "Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.” Canadian MPs, however, have suggested the founders of the company had been lying to parliament.",
  "Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, was grilled last week by British MPs on the company’s decision to send the Observer a legal threat the day before we published our interview with Wylie.",
  "We know that the same cast of characters were involved, Bannon and Nigel Farage chief among them, in both campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic – or, at least, this is what Canadian lawmakers believe.",
  "It’s an insane proposition that the world has sleepwalked into this situation – and, as the DCMS committee has discovered, that there appears to be no democratic means of calling people to account.",
  "Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician and data expert whose research has been pivotal to this investigation, said on Friday that he suspected data had already been migrated to Emerdata.",
  "Or, as one colleague said: “It appears that you have put your stick into the hornets’ nest one time too many.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica announced that it had gone into liquidation.",
  "And, in some respects, the Observer’s battle royale with Cambridge Analytica is a microcosm of everything that has happened to the news and information landscape over the past two years.",
  "One year ago we published the article that led to the first of a series of legal threats from Cambridge Analytica: threats that have dogged the reporting of this story ever since.",
  "And there was “prima facie evidence” that four different Leave campaigns had collaborated, that they had coordinated in their efforts, and that this had been facilitated by AIQ.",
  "Instead, it took place, almost unnoticed, inside Portcullis House, the Palace of Westminster’s overspill building where much of the routine business of government takes place.",
  "There have been so many systemic failures that have brought us to the point at which a US technology platform can be accused of having interfered in the democratic process.",
  "They asked Zackary Massingham and Silvester to give evidence about their relationship with Cambridge Analytica and the work the company had carried out on the referendum.",
  "In an evidence session that Charlie Angus MP said was the most extraordinary he had seen in Canada’s parliament in 14 years, he told them their answers “beggar belief”.",
  "His start-up, personaldata.io, processes data requests on behalf of individuals and he had noticed Cambridge Analytica had changed its form response to these requests.",
  "This is not the end of Cambridge Analytica, and it is not the end of the use of our personal data in ways we may not even be aware of – but it is a triumph of sorts.",
  "Jo Stevens MP pointed out that it was only because of the Guardian’s 2015 article that the company knew about the Cambridge Analytica data breach in the first place.",
  "“AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign.",
  "There are still no easy answers to any of this, but what the Observer investigation into Cambridge Analytica uncovered was that none of it was accidental.",
  "But the writer who led the investigation into it says this is far from the end of the story\n\nThis weekend marks a peculiar anniversary for the Observer.",
  "If Zuckerberg did not come to testify voluntarily, he warned, the next time he entered British territory, he would be “summoned” more formally.",
  "And then: “I am sorry that journalists feel that we are trying to prevent them from getting the truth out.”\n\nThis is not how apologies work.",

  "One company, run by one man, Mark Zuckerberg, that governs and controls how political messages are delivered to two billion voters.",
  "It was inconceivable, Vickery said, that Trump’s campaign did not have access to psychological models derived from Facebook data.",
  "Jeff Silvester, one of AIQ’s founders, said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign.",
  "We know that the data operation of Trump’s campaign is one point of his investigation into potential collusion with the Kremlin.",
  "And, while there are multiple threads to this story, there’s also a central node, an interface between them and us: Facebook.",
  "Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nCambridge Analytica’s cheap and easy fix of calling in the liquidators is not going to cut it.",
