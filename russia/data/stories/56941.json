  "Hannity: Uranium One Deal 'One of the Biggest Scandals in American History'\n\n'It's a Disgrace': Trump Rips Clinton, DNC-Russia Collusion Reports\n\nKim Strassel, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, called out the media and Democrat lawmakers for expressing outrage over alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and then not doing the same over a bombshell new report about the now-infamous Trump dossier.",
  "Trump: Funding of 'Fake' Dossier By Dems Is a 'Sad Commentary' on American Politics\n\nMainstream Media Barely Covers Controversial Obama-Era Uranium Deal\n\n'She's Mired in Scandal Again & She Won't Go Away': Varney on Dems' Hillary Problem\n\nHume: Tide May Be Turning in Russia Story & Not in a Way Dems Like",
  "She said many in the media have pushed the narrative that it was Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambition to help Trump win the 2016 election, but the only fact that the intelligence community unanimously agrees on is that Putin wanted to sow distrust and turmoil in American democracy.",
  "According to the Washington Post, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid more than $9 million to a law firm that, in turn, retained political consulting firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the dossier.",
  "She said Democrats have been trying to protect Fusion GPS from having to answer any questions, which makes one wonder if some members of Congress were aware of who funded the dossier and tried to prevent that information from coming out.",
  "\"We now know that the DNC and the Clinton campaign, through a series of middle men, essentially paid a foreign agent to gin up accusations from Russia, which got injected into our election,\" Strassel explained on Fox Business Network.",
  "\"If that was the goal, how much better could it be than potentially having a dossier that the FBI ended up using to start an entire investigation into a sitting U.S.",
  "She noted that Democrats, such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have spent months trying to \"pooh-pooh\" Republican efforts to find out who financed the dossier.",
  "\"It certainly has caused a lot of turmoil.\"",
