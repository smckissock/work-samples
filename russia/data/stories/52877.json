  "In one of Powell’s more charitable emails, the former George W. Bush cabinet member noted that Trump “appeals to the worst angels of the GOP nature and poor white folks.” In other messages, Powell called the billionaire a “national disgrace” and an “international pariah” and blasted Trump for the birther movement he began with President Obama.",

  "I’ve already spent a lot of time talking about my own, as you know.”\n\nThe former secretary of state further expressed her concern that DCLeaks, the website that posted Powell’s emails, had reported ties to Russian hackers.",

  "“And I have to say I’m increasingly concerned by how we’ve seen Donald Trump’s alarming closeness with the Kremlin become more and more clear over the course of this campaign.",
  "I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster.",
