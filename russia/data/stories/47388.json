  "“The FTC should hold individual executives accountable for order violations in which they participated, even if these individuals were not named in the original orders,” Chopra wrote, adding that when companies violate FTC orders, the commission should consider “outright bans on specific business practices,” “dismissal of senior executives and board members,” divestiture of rogue operating units and clawbacks of executive compensation.",
  "“When companies violate orders, this is usually the result of serious management dysfunction, a calculated risk that the payoff of skirting the law is worth the expected consequences, or both.”\n\nOn Monday morning, Facebook announced it had suspended 200 apps from its platform as part of a company-wide audit.",
  "The tech giant agreed to new policies to prevent future deception and privacy violations, but in March, a whistleblower revealed that Facebook had allowed the international political operative firm Cambridge Analytica to access data from millions of users without their consent.",
  "irrespective of whether they are small-time scammers or sophisticated corporations.”\n\nIn 2011, Facebook settled FTC charges that it had deceived users by telling them they could keep their data private, only to repeatedly allow that data to be shared and made public.",
  "His memo also criticized the approach federal agencies took to corporate crime at big banks during the Obama years, arguing that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve let financial institutions off too easy.",

  "In his memo, Chopra said the FTC should be thinking about “remedies” above and beyond monetary penalties for “recidivist” companies.",
  "His memo, forwarded to HuffPost, did not mention Facebook by name, but the implications for the social media platform were obvious.",
  "The FTC is now investigating whether that breach constitutes a violation of the 2011 settlement, which carries the force of law.",
  "If Facebook failed to comply with terms of the 2011 order, the potential financial liabilities are enormous ?",
  "which could add up to billions or even trillions of dollars in the case of the Cambridge Analytica debacle.",
  "and offer internal support to agency investigators seeking a tough line against repeat offenders.",
  "Chopra, who took office on May 2, is one of two Democratic commissioners on the five-member FTC.",
  "what appears to be a not-so-subtle nod to the commission’s ongoing investigation into Facebook.",
  "Chopra can’t single-handedly impose penalties as a lone commissioner.",
  "But he can bring public pressure against reluctant commissioners ?",

  "“FTC orders are not suggestions,” Chopra wrote."
