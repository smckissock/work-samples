  "The Trump campaign's data analytics operation is being looked at by special counsel Robert Mueller, CNN reported in May 2017\n\nParscale has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the Russian operation to influence the 2016 campaign in favor of Trump and against Hillary Clinton, and says he told the House Intelligence Committee last year as much when he appeared for an interview behind closed doors.",
  "While Kushner's status inside the White House, where he serves as a senior adviser, has come under question amid uncertainty over his security clearance, the President's pick of Parscale to helm the campaign makes clear Kushner remains a hugely influential voice.",
  "Parscale has also denied any knowledge of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix's attempts to reach WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 campaign, while the firm was contracted by the Trump campaign and working closely with Parscale.",
  "That relative anonymity began to unfurl on Tuesday with the announcement that Parscale will helm Trump's 2020 re-election bid as campaign manager, but his appointment was little surprise to Trump campaign veterans and insiders.",

  "In the final weeks, that meant moving resources into states like Michigan and Wisconsin that were expected to go blue in 2016 but ended up proving crucial to Trump's upset victory.",
