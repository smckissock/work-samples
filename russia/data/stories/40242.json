  "If you look at a map of Westeros, that's not very far compared to some of Jon Snow's travels, but it took Arya and The Hound pretty much the duration of the ten-episode season to get there.",
  "This new storytelling tactic was abrupt, and it doesn't make sense for the show when it could have easily fit in with some gradual pacing changes.",
  "In a penultimate season of a show that's wrapping up its story, there isn't time to watch characters travel for five episodes anymore.",
  "The fact that Jon Snow and friends travel so much and appear at their destination in the next scene isn't the problem.",
  "In season six, there wasn't much traveling, so there wasn't an indication that the show was about to change its pace.",
  "This journey ended with Arya sailing to Braavos, and her time with The Hound changed both of them in a lot of ways.",
  "Jon Snow hopping all over the continent of Westeros isn't an issue, the issue is that we weren't eased into it.",
  "With a shortened season and so few episodes left in the series, it was a given that there'd be time jumps.",
  "In season four, one of the central arcs was Arya and The Hound's journey from the Riverlands to the Vale.",
  "The problem is how jarring it is compared to the precedent the show has set for the passage of time.",
  "That's not a problem: we got to know The Hound better, and Arya got to sympathize with him.",
  "This makes the season seven jumps incredibly jarring."
