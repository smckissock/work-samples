  "\"I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else.\"",

  "In addition to Trump's campaign, Cambridge Analytica was also highly active during the lead-up to Brexit in the UK in 2016, in which they helped the \"leave\" campaign garner a surprise victory.",
  "\"Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,\" Rubio said on \"Meet the Press.\"",
  "The company specializes in \"psychographic\" profiling that allows them to paint a picture of online users and then use this information to target them with political campaign ads.",

  "But reports from The New York Times and The Guardian found that Facebook may have been aware of Cambridge Analytica's access as early as in summer of 2016.",

  "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota demanded Facebook Mark Zuckerberg testify before Congress.",
