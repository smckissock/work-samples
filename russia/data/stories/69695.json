  "There are certain preconditions for the success of CPEC: (1) the removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Afghanistan; (2) a reduction of American and Indian influence in South Asia; (3) the curtailment of Islamic extremism and ethnic separatism; and (4) a decrease in regional tensions due to national rivalries; all to be obtained under the stewardship of China, a “Pax Sinica.”\n\nCritical among China’s efforts is the successful wooing of Iran and its proper placement within the framework of CPEC.",
  "From the standpoint of U.S. relations with Riyadh, it is important to note that Saudi Arabia has very recently injected $500 million, a 20-percent stake, into the Russia-China Investment Fund established in June 2012 by two government-backed entities, the Russian Direct Investment Fund and China Investment Corporation (CIC) to advance bilateral economic cooperation between Russia and China.",

  "Although Pakistani media recently claimed that BRI would eventually extend from China through Pakistan’s port of Gwadar and onto Africa via Oman and Riyadh, an offer to join CPEC made to Saudi Arabia by Pakistan was later rescinded, undoubtedly due to objection by Beijing.",
  "The vehicle to achieve it is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a collection of infrastructure projects and a network of commercial agreements designed to link the entire world directly to the Chinese economy through inter-connected land-based and maritime routes.",
