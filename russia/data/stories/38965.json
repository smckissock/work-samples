  "YouTube/Emin Agalarov\n\nSign up for the latest Russia investigation updates here»\n\nThe Russian pop star Emin Agalarov released a music video Tuesday for his new single, \"Got Me Good,\" that references the two biggest scandals engulfing Donald Trump's presidency since he took office last year: the Russia investigation and the Stormy Daniels saga.",
  "It also features actors playing prominent figures, including:\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner\n\nTrump's eldest daughter Ivanka\n\nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThe porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nThe music video opens with an unidentified man walking into a control room with several surveillance monitors.",
  "YouTube/Emin Agalarov\n\nSeveral characters in Emin's music video, including \"Daniels,\" \"Clinton,\" and \"Zuckerberg,\" are separately shown either handing off or picking up unmarked envelopes and briefcases in a scenario orchestrated by Emin while the man in the control room watches the video feed.",
  "Agalarov's name first cropped up in American headlines last year, when it surfaced that he and his father, the real-estate tycoon Aras Agalarov, arranged a meeting between Trump's eldest son and two Russian lobbyists offering the Trump campaign \"dirt\" on then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",
  "Daniels has been a staple in the media since it emerged that Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 in October 2016 in exchange for her silence about an affair she alleges she had with Trump.",
  "Emin's inclusion of Zuckerberg appears to be his way of trolling the tech titan amid allegations of Russian activity on Facebook and the recent privacy scandal involving the now defunct data firm Cambridge Analytica.",
  "The scene is a not-so-subtle reference to the Steele dossier's allegation that Emin sent Russian prostitutes to a hotel room in Moscow where Trump was staying during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia.",
  "The dossier says Russian intelligence obtained surveillance footage of Trump engaging in salacious acts with the women, and then used the tape to blackmail Trump into doing the Kremlin's bidding.",
  "The Daniels payment now makes up a key portion of a federal investigation into whether Cohen committed bank fraud, wire fraud, and campaign finance violations while working for Trump.",
  "YouTube/Emin Agalarov\n\nMeanwhile, another shot in the music video depicts actors playing Ivanka and Kushner walking into the hotel and receiving an unmarked briefcase from Emin.",
  "The scene may be a reference to reports that the Russians or Russia-linked entities contacted several Trump associates offering a dossier of dirt on Clinton during the election.",
  "Emin's music video makes several references to the so-called Steele dossier's allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the election.",
  "\"Trump,\" an actor playing Zuckerberg, and Emin are then shown partying in the hotel room with the contestants, all of whom have stripped down to their bikinis.",
  "Later, all the characters — except the man watching the surveillance footage — are shown drinking, smoking, and playing poker together while betting money.",
  "The surveillance feed shows Emin, an actor playing Trump, and several actresses playing beauty pageant contestants walking down a hotel hallway.",
  "Congressional and FBI investigators are scrutinizing the meeting as part of their probes into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.",
  "The feed cuts to Emin handing Trump a silver briefcase again, which apparently contains money or compromising footage of Clinton.",
  "Emin is often shown grinning in the music video while actors playing Trump and other Americans engage in compromising activity.",
  "Emin hands \"Trump\" a silver briefcase, and they shake hands before entering a hotel room with the pageant contestants.",
  "The music video ends with the man in the control room receiving the silver briefcase with an unmarked envelope in it.",
  "In another scene, Emin is shown taking shots at a bar with \"Ivanka,\" \"Kushner,\" and an actress playing Clinton.",
  "The camera pans to a shot of Emin taking selfies with \"Zuckerberg,\" \"Trump,\" and an actress playing Daniels.",
  "Several scenes in the music video reference the most salacious allegation in the Steele dossier.",
  "The man laughs, and reveals himself as an actor playing the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
  "\"Zuckerberg\" gives Emin an unmarked envelope, and then shakes hands with \"Trump\" at a bar.",
  "Emin and actors playing Trump, Stormy Daniels, and Zuckerberg pose for a selfie.",
  "Back in the control room, the man at the desk erases Trump from the video feed.",
  "\"Clinton\" even bets an unmarked envelope at one point.",
