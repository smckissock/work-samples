  "Researchers Brian Dolhansky and Cristian Canton Ferrer note in their paper for Facebook that \"face retouching algorithms\" like red-eye removal and virtual makeup have become very popular.",
  "This is, however, a new approach to it, which uses General Adversarial Networks, a kind of machine-learning algorithm where two neural networks are pitted against each other.",
  "Getty\n\nFacebook researchers have created a machine-learning system which can take an image of somebody with closed eyes and replace them with open ones.",
  "Facebook\n\nThe researchers did not offer any clues as to whether the eye painting technology could be integrated into Facebook in the future.",
  "Facebook\n\nThis technique of \"in-painting,\" using software to fill a space with what it thinks belongs there, is not new.",
  "So they turned their attention to making an algorithm that could successfully replace closed eyes with open ones.",
  "Facebook\n\nEven though this new method is generally convincing, it isn't foolproof.",
  "Glasses and locks of hair over the eyes were noted to interfere with the results.",
  "Researchers did manage to do a decent job on an image of Mahatma Gandhi, however.",
  "Gandhi's glasses don't seem to have interfered significantly with the algorithm.",
  "The networks are trained to recognize a person's eyes and then re-create them.",
  "In the past, eye in-painting has left a lot to be desired in terms of realism.",
  "Adobe's eye in-painting (third column) compared to Facebook's (fourth column).",
  "Facebook compared its own technology to that of Adobe's eye in-painting.",
  "Adobe's is in the third column and Facebook's is in the final column.",
  "Business Insider has reached out to Facebook for comment.",
  "Facebook's in-painting of eyes is pretty convincing.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg."
