  "In addition, Washington opposes Putin's backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has tried to reset its relationship with Russia and conservative foreign policy experts say they don't always agree with Trump, they do think it's time to thaw the dealings between the two countries.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"pleased\" with Donald Trump's successful campaign and rise to become the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but veteran U.S. diplomats are not so sure if his call to improve relations with the Communist leader is such a good idea.",
  "But in December, while Putin was praising Trump in a gesture that raised eyebrows in the United States and worldwide, Putin said that the New Yorker \"says he wants to move to another level of relations, to closer and deeper relations with Russia — how can we not welcome that?",
  "Trump has also met with positive approval from Russia after suggesting the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization shift their focus to fighting terrorism instead of Russia, leaving Ukrainian and Baltics officials concerned that they would be left unprotected.",
  "\"There's a mythology about foreign policy that it's just like deal-making in the business world, and if you don't like 'the deal,' you can just walk away,\" Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama and a vocal Trump critic, told The Wall Street Journal.",
  "Trump's opinion on Putin is far different from those of his rivals, with Democratic front-runner calling him a \"bully\" and Sen. Marco Rubio, before he dropped from the presidential race, saying Putin is a \"gangster and a thug.\"",
