  "The intelligence panel said in its court filing related to the firm's request that it sought the banking information as part of its effort \"to understand all facets of the 'dossier' written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, including who paid for it, who received it, what steps were taken to corroborate it and whether the FBI relied on it in its investigation of the allegations of collusion.",
  "\"The records sought by the subpoena will allow the Committee to fully understand and perhaps conclusively determine who paid for the 'dossier' and the amount of funds that Fusion GPS paid to Mr. Steele for the performance of his work, as well as determine whether Fusion GPS engaged in other Russia-related work within the scope of the Committee's pending investigation,\" the committee's response said.",
  "\"The fact that they did plead the Fifth obviously is their right, but I think it is important that we hear from them directly, especially with regard to their extremely lengthy response to our request and in part, partially, because their response was that the investigation and subpoena was illegitimate.",
  "\"Such information is crucial for the Committee to fully investigate not only the 'dossier' and its relevance to the question of whether there was possible 'collusion' between the Russian Government and the Trump campaign but also other aspects of the Committee's investigation.\"",

  "But that is what Chairman (Devin) Nunes required of our clients at Fusion GPS today, in a sharp departure from even the past practice of this committee's investigation, where witnesses under the exact same circumstances were excused from appearing.\"",
  "In a 17-page letter to Nunes, attorneys for Fusion GPS said they object to the subpoenas, charging, as they did in their court filing on Friday, that the subpoenas violate First Amendment rights to engage in free speech and political activity.",

  "Washington (CNN) Fusion GPS, the intelligence firm behind the controversial Trump dossier, asked a federal court on Friday to stop its bank from turning over financial records subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee.",
  "His subpoenas are a clear abuse of power: They are designed to obfuscate the facts and conjure up rank conspiracy theories at the behest of the president and his most obsequious allies in Congress.\"",
  "We asked them to come in to answer questions with regard to our investigation, as we have with numerous, numerous witnesses over the last several months,\" Rooney said after the session concluded.",
  "On Saturday, a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Tanya Chutkan, extended the bank's deadline to respond to the subpoena for its records until Wednesday.",
  "After the session , which lasted more than an hour, Levy charged that the committee broke with its past practices by requiring them to physically appear to plead the Fifth.",

  "A source familiar with the matter previously told CNN that all Russia-related subpoenas have been approved by Conaway.",
  "On Saturday, Trump called for his own Justice Department and FBI to release information on who paid for the dossier.",
  "I think by the very fact that they were here shows its legitimacy and I think that's important,\" Rooney added.",
  "\"Through his improper actions and bad faith, Mr. Nunes has demonstrated that this is not such an inquiry.",
  "\"No American should have to experience the indignity that occurred today,\" Levy told reporters.",
  "The subpoenas also requested depositions of key members of the private intelligence firm.",
  "Nunes delegated authority on the Russia matter to Republican Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas.",
  "Conaway at the time confirmed to CNN that he had signed off on the recent subpoenas.",
  "A spokesperson for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment at the time.",
