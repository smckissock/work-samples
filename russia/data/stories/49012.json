  "More: 'Westworld' androids embrace their humanity, if not humans, amid Season 2 chaos\n\nMore: Review: HBO's ‘Westworld’ is smarter, faster, stronger in Season 2\n\nBernard (Jeffrey Wright) remembers a disturbing past incident with the faceless drone hosts in Sunday's episode of \"Westworld.\"",
  "In Westworld’s population of humans and android hosts, Wright (Angels in America, The Hunger Games franchise) straddles two groups: He's a robot, built in the image of human park co-creator Arnold Weber, who works with humans and manages the futuristic theme park's hosts.",
  "Relying on previous memories, Bernard opened a secret entrance to an underground compound, where Bernard and Elsie found James Delos, founder of the company that owns the theme park, or at least a hybrid version: an android body copy with transplanted human consciousness.",
  "More: 'Westworld recap': Episode 3 shocks with a surprise new park\n\nMore: ‘Westworld’ recap: Some answers, at long last, in Episode 2\n\nBernard (Jeffrey Wright) crosses paths with Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) in Season 2 of \"Westworld,\" but this time he's not in control.",
  "If Bernard can keep from leaking too much cortical fluid, a side effect of his bullet wound, he has a chance to uncover more of Westworld's mysteries while learning more about who he is and what he wants to do.",
  "Bernard also battles hand tremors, speech difficulties and full-on convulsions, the consequences of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head ordered last season by Arnold's partner, Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins).",
  "\"As actors, most of us are used to understanding as much as we possibly can, but we understand, because of the scale and trajectory of (Westworld), there are going to be limitations to what we know.\"",
  "For all his physical and mental difficulties, Bernard is learning shocking truths about the park: that Delos is collecting data on its human guests — shades of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica?",
  "He’s experienced in the host side and the human side, so he’s (different from) Dolores or Maeve,” although he’s been a little slower in developing a consciousness, Wright says.",
  "Bernard was mild-mannered at the start of the first season, a technocratic puppetmaster pulling hosts' strings inside the protected confines of park management offices.",
  "The cultured, cerebral, careful and sometimes confused android impersonated an action star, punching an attacker in the neck and throwing him through a glass divider.",
  "\"Delos has motives beyond being a theme park … and questions of corporate control and agendas are beginning to be explored in a way that I think will resonate today.\"",
  "The multiple timelines are complicated for viewers, but also for Wright, because scenes often were filmed out of order to meet a demanding production schedule.",
  "(Photo: John P. Johnson/HBO)\n\nLater, Bernard realized he had some control over his fate, telling Elsie: \"For the first time, I get to decide who I want to be.\"",
  "In Season 2, he's been out in the very dangerous wild, his conservative attire in tatters after being pursued, imprisoned and dragged all over the park.",
  "Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) has taken a beating during Season 2 of HBO's \"Westworld,\" but he's picking up valuable information about the park and himself.",
  "If that's not enough, Bernard has to make sense of experiences from multiple timelines, because he can't fix his memories to particular points in time.",
  "(Photo: HBO)\n\nBernard Lowe, the Westworld host with the most reserve, showed a surprising tough-guy persona in Sunday’s episode of HBO's sci-fi drama.",
  "Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY\n\nAndroid host Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) has expanded his consciousness and travels in Season 2 of \"Westworld.\"",

  "Later, he remembered the cause of a laboratory slaughter: He coldly ordered faceless drone hosts to go on a murder-suicide rampage.",
  "\"In the first season, Bernard was on a journey of discovery about the park that led to discovery about himself,\" Wright says.",
  "“Bernard’s mild-mannered, until he’s not,” says Jeffrey Wright, the actor who plays the increasingly complex character.",
