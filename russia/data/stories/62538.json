  "“There were hundreds of folders.”\n\nFor more of Cynthia McFadden's interview with Guccifer, watch Nightly News on Thursday and the new NBC series \"On Assignment,\" which debuts Sunday at 7 p.m. ET/ 6 p.m. CT.\n\nLazar — who peppers conversation with wild conspiracy theories and even racist comments — is no longer in Romania.",
  "The unemployed taxi driver recounted how he used a cheap computer and cellphone – and intensive research that allowed him to guess passwords and security clues -- to make a name for himself in Romania, which is such a hotbed for hackers and cyber-scammers that the FBI set up a permanent office there.",
  "/ Updated By Cynthia McFadden, Tim Uehlinger, Nicole Boucher and Tracy Connor\n\nThe Romanian hacker who first exposed Hillary Clinton's private email address is making a bombshell new claim — that he also gained access to the former Secretary of State's \"completely unsecured\" server.",
  "Although Lazar has pleaded not guilty to the federal criminal charges, he boasted about the Internet intrusions in his first American on-camera interview — which can be seen Thursday on NBC Nightly News and Sunday on Dateline’s “On Assignment” premiere.",
  "It’s unclear what impact Lazar’s story could have on Clinton’s presidential prospects, but one of her biggest critics, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, fired off a letter last month asking if she knew whether or not the Romanian had accessed her server.",
  "\"We have received no indication from any government agency to support these claims, nor are they reflected in the range of charges that Guccifer already faces and that prompted his extradition in the first place,\" Fallon added.",
  "A source familiar with the Clinton case confirmed to NBC News that the FBI’s review of her server logs showed no signs of foreign hacking, but Tarbell said that such logs may not be comprehensive and don’t rule out a breach.",
  "“It was boring stuff.”\n\nThat was two years before the New York Times reported that Clinton had used the HDR22 email for all her State Department business and that she had a private server in her Chappaqua, New York, home.",
  "When he seized control of Powell’s Facebook page, he left a message, “You will burn in hell, Bush!”\n\nRomanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, also known as Guccifer, claims he got into Hillary Clinton's private email server.",
  "He was extradited last month to the United States to face charges he hacked political elites, including Gen. Colin Powell, a member of the Bush family, and former Clinton advisor Sidney Blumenthal.",
  "As political opponents charged that national security was compromised and the FBI launched an investigation, Clinton maintained that the server was safe and there were no security breaks.",
  "He set his sights on Washington, hoping to uncover evidence to support his outlandish belief that an international cabal called the Illuminati is secretly controlling world affairs.",
  "He admits he raided the email of Dorothy Bush Koch, revealing to the world that her brother, President George Bush, was an amateur painter and her father, President George H.W.",
  "“It was like an open orchid on the Internet,” Marcel Lehel Lazar, who uses the devilish handle Guccifer, told NBC News in an exclusive interview from a prison in Bucharest.",
  "NBC News\n\nLazar, 44, did not give any proof to back up his claim and would not provide copies of the emails he said he downloaded from the Clinton server.",
  "\"There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell,\" Brian Fallon, the campaign press secretary.",
  "“It’s plausible,” Chris Tarbell said, adding that Lazar's conviction for hacking in Romania showed he had the know-how to carry it out.",
  "\"In addition to the fact that he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton's server are inaccurate.",
  "For his part, Guccifer said he never intended to influence the presidential race, though he seems to relish the idea that he could.",
  "\"And it has been reported that security logs from Secretary Clinton's email server do not show any evidence of foreign hacking.\"",
  "NBC News\n\nBut it was Blumenthal’s account, hacked in 2013, that yielded the biggest secret — emails from hdr22@clintonemail.com.",
  "Officials emphasize that investigators have seen nothing so far to substantiate his claim but that the investigation continues.",
  "NBC News asked Chris Tarbell, who broke open the Silk Road case, to review Lazar's explanation of how he got into the server.",
  "It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims.",
  "Guccifer said he noted the initials matched Clinton’s maiden name, Hillary Diane Rodham — a “wow moment,” he called it.",
  "Tarbell added that he could not imagine why Lazar would make up a claim that could get him in very hot water.",
  "“At that time I wasn't even thinking about the electoral campaign of 2016,” he said of his 2013 exploits.",
  "Hillary Clinton takes part in a discussion with women at a campaign stop, Friday, April 22, 2016.",
  "Still, a former FBI special agent who ran major cybersecurity probes found his story credible.",
  "Tarbell, however, notes that the handiwork of a hacker like Guccifer is built on dishonesty.",
  "“To go on television and admit to a felony you didn’t commit seems a little silly,” he said.",
  "A source said he was escorted to a Virginia jail by FBI agents who spoke to him in transit.",
  "By his account, he used the data in the header of the emails as a road map to her server.",
  "Matt Rourke / AP\n\nClinton’s presidential campaign said Lazar’s claims were baseless.",
  "“By running a scan, I found that server…that was completely unsecured,” he said.",
  "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.",
  "Once inside, he was able to view and download emails, he claimed.",
  "Cynthia McFadden with the Romanian hacker Guccifer in Romania.",
  "The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.",
  "“They're a pathological, well-practiced liar,” he said.",
  "“It was not what I was looking for,” he sniffed.",
  "“But that's where things are heading.”",
  "“It was a lie, clearly,” Lazar said.",
  "Bush, was ill."
