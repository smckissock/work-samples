  "BARTIROMO: You have got to explain to me how it is that somebody who OKed, gave the green light on the FISA warrant based on all of this unverified information -- I'm talking about Rod Rosenstein -- the same guy who wrote a letter to have Jim Comey fired, and then was upset that the president mentioned that he wrote the letter to get Comey fired, the same guy who is running the DOJ today who has been sitting on documents that you and your colleagues have been asking for, for more information about how this all came up, this is the same individual who's overseeing the Robert Mueller investigation?",
  "But we also need to find out from Nellie Ohr, who was paid $40,000 by Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS for her work, including the work on the Steele dossier, why that fact, the fact that the wife of the number four person at the Department of Justice, who, along with her husband, had operational roles with respect to the Steele dossier, that that fact wasn't disclosed by the Department of Justice when they presented that evidence to the FISA court.",
  "RATCLIFFE: I think, at the end of the day, Maria, where we are headed here is no charges for collusion or obstruction with anyone associated with the Trump campaign, but a report from Bob Mueller outlining perhaps some questionable conduct, and we will be left arguing with our Democratic colleagues whether that rises to an impeachable offense, even if it's not criminal in nature.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: There are three separate FBI agents, McCabe, Lisa Page, and James Baker, the former FBI counsel, all who say this was a serious plot, this wasn't a joke, there was a real discussion in May, right after Comey was fired, about possibly taking out the president by recording him and then going to the Cabinet invoking the 25th Amendment.",
  "We have got the pictures...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCARTHY: Plus, there's a new...\n\nBARTIROMO: ... at the border, which we're showing -- $16.6 billion is going to be dedicated to the physical barriers, while the rest is going to cover the technology, operations and other infrastructure costs, as you mentioned, which are all associated with border security.",
  "Hypothetically, if the Department of Justice and the FBI has another piece of evidence that directly refutes, that directly contradicts that, what you would expect is for the Department of Justice to present both sides of the coin to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to evaluate the weight and sufficiency of that evidence.",
  "The head of the FBI, acting Director Andy McCabe, and the head of the Department of Justice with respect to the Russia investigation, Rod Rosenstein, in direct conflict with one another, each accusing the other of not telling the truth with regard to whether or not someone wanted to record the president of the United States.",
  "When Jim Baker was in his deposition two weeks ago and was asked about this, he was as serious as you could be in describing what he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein, where Mr. Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United States.",
  "Frame it up like that and, if we do that, go run that kind of campaign, their craziness and what's been accomplished in the last 20 months, I think we win and we keep the majority, and they don't get to run out the clock and do all the crazy things they want to do if, in fact, they get power.",
  "We need him to answer questions about all kinds of issues associated with the Trump-Russia investigation, but specifically the statement that it's alleged that he said where he talked about actually recording the commander in chief of our great country and he talked about the 25th Amendment.",
  "The reason for that, Maria, is that Glenn Simpson had previously testified under oath to the House Intelligence Committee that he never met with Bruce Ohr or discussed with Bruce Ohr the Steele dossier prior to the October FISA application in 2016 or the 2016 presidential election.",
  "BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the conflicts that we're seeing between what you have heard from Andrew McCabe, who now has been referred criminal -- for criminal charges, and Rod Rosenstein, because, apparently, there are conflicts in what the two say.",
  "House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte now threatening to subpoena Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this as Republican push for answers on whether Rosenstein was serious when he reportedly floated the idea of secretly recording President Trump.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Pastor Andrew Brunson should be freed and should be allowed to return to his family, to his home, to his church and his nation in the United States of America.",
  "Instead, what happened here was, Department of Justice and FBI officials in the Obama administration in October of 2016 only presented to the court the evidence that made the government's case to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate.",
  "She did all of this research, which was never verified, on Donald Trump, and then put it in this dossier, and then put it on a little thumb drive and gave it to her husband at the DOJ, who wasn't even working on anything about Trump at the time.",
  "Look, when you're the guy who in reality is running the Justice Department, and the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asks you to come, you are obligated to come and you're obligated to come and testify under oath.",
  "The underlying pretext to the entire Trump-Russia investigation, Maria, is this idea that George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign associate, had a conversation with an Australian diplomat about getting Hillary Clinton's e-mails from the Russians.",
  "So that's why we need to talk to Nellie Ohr and others to try and determine what the FBI knew, when they knew it, what the Department of Justice knew, when they knew it, and why those representations weren't fully disclosed to the FISA court.",
  "Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ-Roll Call.",
  "So when he says that he believed Rod Rosenstein was serious about this, this -- this alleged statement about recording the president, you got to take that with the weight that it comes with, because it's the -- it's the FBI chief counsel.",
  "House Republicans may get a crack at two key players in their investigation into the anti-Trump dossier this upcoming week -- the answers they could provide and why one of the biggest players in the investigation is refusing to testify.",
  "I trust that President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo and Ambassador Bolton and others will get the information they need to fairly evaluate this and determine what sort of diplomatic actions need to be taken against Saudi Arabia.",
  "RATCLIFFE: Well, ultimately, the questions with respect to the FISA court and the representations that were made, remember, what we're talking about is the extraordinary measure of getting a warrant to spy on an American citizen.",
  "House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy will talk -- join me, talking about the state of play for keeping that chamber in Republican hands come November, as well as his bill that he just introduced to fully fund the border wall.",
  "So I think this campaign, Maria, is real simple, the extreme and radical and crazy positions the left and the Democrats are now taking vs. the amazing record under the leadership of President Trump over the last 20 months.",
  "And it's -- when you are talking about a million dollars a week in L.A., and we have got four or five congressional seats in L.A. area, if it wasn't for McCarthy's effort, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't even be in the game.",
  "Could Republican House lawmakers subpoena Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if he doesn't provide them with an on-the-record interview about reports he offered to wear a wire during meetings with President Trump?",
  "Why won't the president declassify all these documents, so that the American people can clearly understand what happened here, rather than having this hint of Donald Trump had anything to do with it in the zeitgeist?",
  "So we need him back in there, where we're going to ask more about that specific meeting that took place, and then his conversations with people who were in that meeting, how those went and who all he talked to you.",
  "And that's why I am bound and determined we're going to subpoena whoever we have to and get the answers, and hopefully have a Justice Department who will actually prosecute -- prosecute people who deserve it.",
  "I know you have been traveling the country, trying to support your colleagues across the country in different races, as well as raising an enormous amount of money for your colleagues in the Republican Party.",
  "At the same time, the special counsel is outsourcing and delegating investigative matters back to component agencies or component compartments within the Department of Justice and the U.S. attorney's office.",
  "BARTIROMO: Going into the midterm elections, all guys are wondering if these investigations even continue, because, if the Democrats flip the House, we may never hear another word about these investigations.",
  "Will the president declassify these documents, so that the American people can understand how they put together this narrative that Donald Trump had anything to do with Russia meddling in the U.S. election?",
  "There is a real concern that I have, though, because Michael Bloomberg, if you watched, who recently re-registered a Democrat, he is trying to buy the Democratic nomination to run against President Trump.",
  "(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARTIROMO: That was President Trump last night in Kentucky making the case for Republican candidates with T-minus 23 days until Americans head to the poll.",
  "Up next, on Saudi Arabia, it says it will not be threatened, after President Trump warns of severe punishment if the country is responsible for the disappearance of the Washington Post columnist.",
  "So all these sources giving information to the FBI, I think it was this idea that the more people you have talking about the big lie, which was the dossier, the more apt people are to believe it.",
  "And it's consistent with the special counsel indicating that it will accept now written answers from Donald Trump's lawyers about all matters collusion-related to obstruction-of-justice-related.",
  "It is a big week ahead for House lawmakers looking for answers after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decides not to testify to Congress about report he planned to spy on the president.",
  "We talk with House Judiciary Committee members Jim Jordan and John Ratcliffe coming up, and the next steps to probing the DOJ and FBI action to the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.",
  "BARTIROMO: It sounds like there was a group at the top of the FBI and the DOJ who frankly didn't like Donald Trump, didn't want him to be president, so they just actively tried to stop him.",
  "The Saudis say: \"The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations.\"",
  "Here's Young Kim, an immigrant from South Korea, Republican, running against Gil Cisneros, who was accused earlier this year from a Democrat running for the statehouse of sexual harassment.",
  "The FBI and the Department of Justice cannot be expected to fairly investigate that matter, when the heads of both of those components at the Department of Justice are in direct conflict.",
  "It would expose certain folks at the Obama Justice Department and FBI and their actions and their actions taken to conceal material facts from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.",
  "RATCLIFFE: Well, as you know, we did subpoena Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS co-founder, the person who commissioned the infamous Steele dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC.",
  "And that's exactly the technique and the method they were trying to use to get people to buy into this dossier that was actually used to go spy on the other -- other party's campaign.",
  "And now, even in California, that register -- registers you to vote at the DMV, their own government acknowledged they made a mistake and have registered illegals to vote throughout.",
  "We need to, because, again, we have got to get answers to these important questions that -- that go to the heart of this idea that it's supposed to be equal treatment under the law.",
  "And I can tell you, as a former federal prosecutor, my opinion is that declassifying them wouldn't expose any national security information, wouldn't expose any sources and methods.",
  "And if that was done under false pretenses, with false information or false verifications, then that's violating someone's civil liberties under color of law, 42-USC-1983 violation.",
  "I mean, think about it, regulations reduced, taxes cut, economy growing at 4.2 percent, unemployment its lowest than 40 years, court -- Gorsuch and Kavanaugh both on the court.",
  "JORDAN: yes, I definitely think it's helped Republicans to see this -- for the American people to see us actually standing firm and getting done what we said we would get done.",
  "And I -- like I said, I think both of them should be -- shouldn't be overseeing the Mueller investigation, because McCabe had the conflict when his wife was running for office.",
  "I would expect Chairman Gowdy and lawmakers like Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan possibly to issue a subpoena to force this issue with Rosenstein as early as today or early next week.",
  "And John Huber, the guy who was put in charge the U.S. attorney to look into all this, we have not had one report from him over the last six months since he's been on the job.",
  "Things have gotten heated up, with your detractors and the left throwing people out of restaurants, talking about, if you don't agree with us, there won't be any civility.",
  "And where this is important is the evangelical community, which is a very important part of our political base, wanted this man, who was unfairly imprisoned, to come home.",
  "That is the thing that frustrates me and, more importantly, frustrates you in the media and those people across this great country who want to know exactly what happened.",
  "And unless and until we see this incontrovertible evidence that the Turkish government says that they have, I think we should certainly proceed cautiously in this area.",
  "President Trump has done really well on these issues where he's had to be strong, negotiate, get people home, or do things that people said he couldn't otherwise do.",
  "JORDAN: This idea that there's now this double standard, one set of rules for us regular folk, but a different set if you're part of the politically connected class.",
  "Well, the campaigner in chief makes the case for the GOP this midterm election, and U.S. diplomatic tensions with Turkey ease, while intensifying with Saudi Arabia.",
  "HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, D-FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.",
  "And now we have Glenn Simpson, the guy who was paid for by the Clinton campaign, who put together this fake dossier that was used to go spy on the Trump campaign.",
  "And now we know that the chief lawyer for Perkins Coie, who represented the Democratic National Committee, is giving information to the FBI chief counsel as well.",
  "BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting when you look at that, because, for the longest time, the Democrats tried to say they were the party of the American worker.",
  "RATCLIFFE: Well, Maria, very clearly, this is a gruesome allegation, that the Saudi government was involved in the slaying or alleged slaying of Mr. Khashoggi.",
  "But, more importantly, it will remove the illegals who belong to gangs like MS-13 that are going into our communities and causing havoc and drugs throughout.",
  "So, I mean, the bottom line is, this -- just using the powers of the American public, our economic powers, and our military power to really put pressure on.",
  "I don't see the same thing, because some late-breaking trends right now are indicating to me that Republicans could have a much better time than we think.",
  "You can either vote for a Democrat mob rule, or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom and justice.",
  "Then you could go out to Barbara Comstock, who is still in the lead, who is -- the Democrats have fought every time, but who has been such a big fighter.",
  "He also plans to question some key players in their investigation into the FBI's handling of the Russia probe, as well as the Steele dossier, this week.",
  "And yet the document that was put together, this dossier, was what was used to go to the secret court to get a warrant to go spy on the other campaign.",
  "BARTIROMO: But what must be said here are the people that were giving the information to the FBI were all working for the opposition, Hillary Clinton.",
  "We have asked to see the document that Mr. Rosenstein wrote on August 2, 2017, which altered the scope of the investigation that Mr. Mueller is doing.",
  "Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS that helped assemble the dossier, was expected to face the panel on Tuesday.",
  "And yet, when you look at the donations from individuals into the Republican Party, you are beating -- you are beating the Democrats in that regard.",
  "The truth is, as I said earlier this week and the president's made clear, transferring Pastor Andrew Brunson to home arrest is just not good enough.",
  "BARTIROMO: It has been a priority for President Trump to bring home these people who have been imprisoned...\n\nROLLINS: Absolutely, from the get-go.",
  "We have asked for the 302s that -- Bruce Ohr's 302 when he had conversations with the FBI detailing what he said to Glenn Simpson and Chris Steele.",
  "Or what do you think about Kate's Law, that it makes the penalties harder if somebody comes here illegally, gets deported and enters back in here?",
  "The intensity level, there was an advantage on the Democratic side, but that has narrowed after viewing what the Democrats have done to Kavanaugh.",
  "What this is about is safe communities, our children, protecting them from fentanyl, protecting them from gang members and from human trafficking.",
  "JORDAN: OK.\n\nBARTIROMO: I got to get your take on the comments from some top Democrats that are raising red flags ahead of the midterm elections.",
  "And the same names are the same folks whose conduct is at issue with respect to how evidence was presented or not presented to the FISA court.",
  "And I don't think that was followed in how the FBI started and launched and ran this -- this investigation into the president and to Russian.",
  "And they were overseeing two investigations, one investigation into this narrative that Donald Trump had anything to do with Russia meddling.",
  "RATCLIFFE: That issue, I would advocate for the appointment of a special counsel other than Robert Mueller to look at these specific issues.",
  "The president was just there in Kentucky because that's one of the first races you're going to want to watch, Andy Barr against Amy McGrath.",
  "BARTIROMO: He's raised something like $70 million or something from various...\n\nROLLINS: Well, unfortunately, the speaker didn't step aside.",
  "I mean, how is that investigation having any credibility if he's not actually looking at who did collude or who did work with the Russians?",
  "So take all that, and then add into the fact that Rod Rosenstein was a no-show this week, and Glenn Simpson is taking the Fifth on Tuesday.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On this Election Day, November 6, every American faces a simple choice.",

  "Texas Republican Congressman, member of the House Judiciary John Ratcliffe joins me next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"",

  "And, of course, Rosenstein wrote the memo to -- that was given to the president that became the justification for firing James Comey.",
  "Now Pastor Andrew Brunson is back home on U.S. soil, receiving a heartfelt welcome from the president at the White House on Saturday.",
  "ROLLINS: Majority Leader McCarthy has done a fabulous job of being out there, raising money, trying to -- trying to supplement this.",
  "And Michael Sussmann, the lawyer at Perkins Coie, was the key lawyer for the Democrat National Committee and the Clinton campaign.",
  "All of the documents that Chairman Nunes and others are seeking to declassify, to have the president declassify, I have seen them.",
  "That's why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.",
  "You had Glenn Simpson and actually Christopher Steele, the guy who wrote the dossier, passing information directly to the FBI.",
  "This should never have happened...\n\nJORDAN: Well...\n\nBARTIROMO: ... where people in power could put their finger on the scale.",
  "We have two members of the Judiciary Committee on the program this morning, Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe a short time ago.",

  "For the first time, Republicans, in a number of months, it's 79 Republican, 81 percent Democrats as far as voter enthusiasm.",
  "Remember, it was just a few years ago where we had Lois Lerner at the IRS target conservatives for their political beliefs.",
  "But if the Democrats take over, we will never get to build that border security wall that we promised the American people.",
  "But cutting off ties or ending arms deals with an ally in the Middle East only creates a vacuum for our adversaries there.",
  "BARTIROMO: Yes, particularly since this is our ally up against Iran, which continues with its hate and terrorist behavior.",
  "BARTIROMO: I want to get to your bill in a moment, because I love the -- I love the name, Build the Wall, Enforce the Law.",
  "BARTIROMO: Here's a former A.G. Eric Holder and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton just in the last two weeks.",
  "RATCLIFFE: Well, the reason for that, Maria, is that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has not appointed a special counsel.",
  "And you have got the Justice Department and FBI, who are not supposed to be involved in politics, having the discussion.",
  "We now know the story that Mr. McCabe and Mr. Rosenstein have been in conflict and arguing about who should be recused.",
  "BARTIROMO: You have got Glenn Simpson, who is expected on Tuesday; then, on Thursday, James Baker; Friday, Nellie Ohr.",
  "Well, that you now have so many different people communicating information to the FBI about the Russia investigation.",

  "He also sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and he is a member of the House Freedom Caucus.",
  "Now, you also want to watch, for your viewers, where could they help in the process, this Bloomberg money coming in?",
  "At this point in time, I think we have probably lost already 14 or 15 of our House races because of the open seats.",
  "And the United States of America is prepared to bring sanctions against Turkey until Pastor Andrew Brunson is free.",
  "Look what we have done to combat opioids, the largest comprehensive bill you have ever seen, more than $4 billion.",
  "And that visual of the pastor praying over the president yesterday is one that is energizing the Republican base.",
  "Nellie Ohr's husband, who's a top official at the DOJ, was getting information that he was passing on to the FBI.",
  "I'm back with Congressman Jim Jordan of both the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees.",
  "And one of the things Mueller is looking into is potential obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey.",
  "He would have sat for another two or three years in jail if Trump had not beat on Erdogan to make this happen.",
  "You got Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million, Tom Steyer tens of millions, George Soros paying the activists.",
  "He's doing exactly what he promised he was going to do, what he campaigned on, and what he was elected to do.",
  "Let me give you an example that may put this in context with -- without revealing anything that's classified.",

  "So, for those states that are protecting these illegals, they don't get grants from the federal government.",
  "And in John Solomon's op-ed which was posted last week, he writes this, that, basically, this was the plan.",
  "But since he said that he didn't really mean that in a serious way, we have heard from a number of people.",
  "But now cracks emerge with Saudi Arabia after a Washington Post columnist disappears and is presumed dead.",
  "MCCARTHY: Well, the first thing you want to watch, where could the Republicans actually defeat a Democrat?",
  "Now, remember, Maria, we have fully funded the first request of the president to start building that wall.",
  "And then we know that he also met with the lawyer from the Democratic National Committee on Mr. Sussmann.",
  "JORDAN: No, they -- the left and the Democrats have taken the most extreme positions in American history.",
  "Saudi Arabia may be a tenuous ally, but they are still an ally in the most volatile region in the world.",

  "There was a really significant strategy here in trying to take Donald Trump down, it appears to me.",
  "But a number of our candidates are doing very well and have gotten a bump in the last couple weeks.",
  "RATCLIFFE: So, where it's going, in my informed opinion as a prosecutor, is that it's winding down.",
  "President Trump welcoming home Pastor Andrew Brunson after he was detained for two years in Turkey.",
  "And so McCarthy has really stepped in and filled in the blanks, and I think has done a superb job.",
  "REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALI., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Well, thank you very much for having me back.",
  "What other races should we be watching in terms of a close call here between Dems and Republicans?",

  "Bloomberg just sent a million dollars against Karen Handel right outside of Atlanta -- Atlanta.",

  "Also ahead, Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe, as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.",
  "Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr's wife, certainly can shed some light with respect to that circumstance.",
  "I think that's a second thing to watch, in addition to the contempt filing that we should see.",
  "Both of them should be recused from overseeing anything to do with the Mueller investigation.",
  "He joined me last week on FOX Business Network on the morning program \"Mornings with Maria.\"",
  "That is a highly Spanish-speaking district that the Democrats thought they'd pick up easily.",
  "And I don't think that they necessarily understand what the American people are looking for.",
  "They have putting pressure for two years, and the reality is, this is very, very important.",
  "I mean, a few weeks ago, the president initially said that he was going to declassify them.",

  "The move perhaps easing months of diplomatic strain between the U.S. and Turkey.",
  "You know what's happening out there in these Democrat-controlled liberal cities?",
  "And we're down really where we got to win everything else that is on the board.",

  "With respect...\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes, but I want to know where the Mueller is going.",
  "RATCLIFFE: Well, that's a good question for the president of the United States.",
  "BARTIROMO: But you just rattled off a couple of things that need to be public.",
  "Let us know what you want to hear from all of those people who are coming up.",
