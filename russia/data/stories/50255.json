  "According to 23 AI experts Martin Ford interviewed for his new book, Architects Of Intelligence, the real imminent AI-threats relate to politics, security, privacy, and the weaponization of AI.",
  "The purpose of Architects Of Intelligence is to draw everyone - not just AI researchers - into the discussion of immediate impacts of AI which are already affecting our society today.",
  "A few do take those concerns quite seriously, though and believe we should be working on a solution now, even if the advent of super-intelligent machines lies far in the future.",
  "We also have to think about security as we rely more on AI-powered autonomous systems which can become more susceptible to hacking when humans are out of the loop.",
  "To understand how these problems affect society today, it's helpful to see them from the perspective of leaders which have helped shape the current AI revolution.",
  "Recently, we've also started to see news about AI algorithms which have led to biased decisions based on gender and race in hiring and in other areas.",
  "Before building that Soviet-era bunker to survive the AIpocalypse, consider more immediate issues which are already affecting society today.",
  "It's a bit like reading a book about relativity written by Einstein - some of these people have invented key AI concepts in use today.",
  "William Falcon: After your conversations with these researchers, what are your views on AGI (artificial general intelligence)?",
  "Even on the question of a potential existential threat of super intelligence, is that something we should really worry about?",
  "Most of them were pretty dismissive of that and thought that it's not something we should be really concerned with right now.",
  "William Falcon: Now that we've identified some of these core issues, what are tangible next steps to starting to solve them?",
  "The AI-hype would have you believing that we'll soon be enslaved by super-intelligent beings or hunted by killer robots.",
  "They don't agree on details of what that looks like exactly, but this technology will have a massive impact on society.",
  "The people I spoke to do not agree that we need to regulate AI research, but instead suggest regulating applications.",
  "I also included a section in the beginning for technical terms which might be implied in some of the discussions.",
  "Even reading emotions can be used in all sorts of nefarious ways to manipulate shoppers or during negotiations.",
  "The book is intended for a wider audience than just researchers and engineers working or interested in AI.",
  "Martin Ford: When I started a software company in the 90s, I noticed the impact of technology on jobs.",
  "The book aims to highlight what some of those issues are and to teach a bit more about the technology.",
  "Everyone should be concerned with AI, how it has progressed and its impact on the economy and society.",
  "These are all issues that are already happening today and will become much bigger in the coming years.",
  "Martin Ford: The biggest takeaway for them is that everyone agrees that AI is going to be disruptive.",
  "We've already seen some of this impact on our political system from events like Cambridge Analytica.",
  "William Falcon: What is the main takeaway for those readers not directly working on AI research?",
  "But the main takeaway - on all the issues, not just AGI - is that there isn't a consensus.",
  "That's when I started thinking about the impact of AI and robotics on the job market.",
  "Martin Ford: The main takeaway is that everyone I interviewed has a different idea.",
  "William Falcon: What are more immediate concerns we should be thinking about?",
  "At the end of the book, there's a survey asking what year AGI might arrive.",
  "That led to two books, The Lights in the Tunnel and Rise of the Robots.",
  "William Falcon: Why did you decide to write Architects Of Intelligence?",
  "The big one everyone's really worried about is the weaponization of AI.",
  "Martin Ford: Some of this will have to enter the political sphere.",
  "Martin Ford: Impact on privacy, our political system and security.",
  "Everyone should be concerned about this, not just AI researchers.",
  "We'll need to develop some forms of regulation in some areas.",
  "This post has been updated since it was originally published.",
  "Architects Of Intelligence has 23 researchers, not 21.",
  "Another is how facial recognition should be used.",
  "William Falcon: Who is the audience for the book?",
  "Especially people with a strong interest in AI.",
  "* Often called the Godfathers of Deep Learning.",
  "Modifications made after original article:\n\n1.",
  "Self-driving cars are one obvious example.",
  "The average is 80 years from now.",
  "Who are the researchers?",
  "Martin Ford: Anyone!",
  "Added the last two."
