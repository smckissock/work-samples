  "Lawyer claims porn actor, who alleges affair with Trump, violated non-disclosure agreement as many as 20 times\n\nDonald Trump’s lawyers are seeking $20m in damages from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor whose professional name is Stormy Daniels and who claims to have had an affair with the future president in 2006 and 2007.",
  "We are not going away and we will not be intimidated by these threats.”\n\nThe latest turn in the dispute trails what promises to be an explosive CBS 60 Minutes’ interview with Clifford, scheduled for broadcast next Sunday.",
  "According to Friday’s filing with the US district court for the central district of California, Cohen now plans to force the dispute from state to federal court and into closed-door arbitration.",
  "A lawyer representing Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s company, Essential Consultants, claimed in federal court on Friday that Clifford had violated a non-disclosure agreement as many as 20 times.",
  "Cohen, who has said he was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign for making the payment, has not explained what the payment was for or whether Trump was aware of it.",
  "“The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20m in bogus ‘damages’ against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is truly remarkable.",
  "Clifford’s counsel, Michael Avenatti, said the threat to pursue his client for millions and efforts to force the matter under the cover of anonymity amounted to bullying.",
  "Stormy Daniels was threatened with physical harm, lawyer claims Read more\n\nClifford has said she was secretly paid $130,000 to keep quiet.",
  "This week, Avenatti claimed six other women had similar stories to tell, two of whom were similarly under non-disclosure agreements.",
  "Avenatti has claimed the non-disclosure agreement signed by his client is invalid because Trump failed to sign it too.",
  "The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has rejected the notion that Trump approved the payment to Clifford.",
  "If the courts determine the NDA is valid, the actor could face a penalty of $1m for each violation.",
  "“To put it simply – they want to hide the truth from the American people.",
  "The White House has also denied Trump had an affair with Daniels.",
  "Trump has also obtained a restraining order against Clifford.",
  "We will oppose this effort at every turn,” Avenatti said.",
  "He also said Clifford had been threatened.",
  "Likely unprecedented in our history."
