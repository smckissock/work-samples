  "When Trump was pressed during a campaign conference last year about his ties to Russia, he said, \"You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach,\" adding that he \"sold it to a Russian for $100 million.\"",
  "Associated Press/Evan Vucci\n\nWASHINGTON â€” Lawyers for President Donald Trump said Friday that a review of his last 10 years of tax returns did not reflect \"any income of any type from Russian sources,\" with some exceptions.",
  "The letter, written by attorneys Sheri Dillon and William Nelson from the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, simultaneously leaves open the possibility of other Russian ties while attempting to dismiss them.",
  "The attorneys also say that over the last 10 years, it is likely the Trump Organization sold or rented condos or other products that \"could have produced income attributable to Russian sources.\"",
  "The unnamed Russian billionaire cited by the Trump company's lawyers is Dmitry Rybolovlev, whose financial empire springs from his companies' production of potash, often used for fertilizer.",
  "The White House said Trump asked his lawyers for the letter after a request from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for information about any ties Trump might have to Russia.",
  "Their review also notably takes into account Trump's returns from only the past 10 years, leaving questions about whether there were financial dealings with Russia in earlier years.",
  "But it reflected some exceptions, including income from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that was held in Moscow and a property sold to a Russian billionaire in 2008 for $95 million.",
  "The letter came amid an active FBI probe into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia's election meddling and days after Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey.",

  "Trump had purchased the 62,000-square-foot estate for $41.35 million in 2004, and he sold the mansion to Rybolovlev in July 2008 for $95 million.",
  "The president said he \"had dealings over the years,\" including the Miss Universe pageant and the sale of a home to \"a very wealthy Russian.\"",
  "The attorneys did not release copies of Trump's tax returns, so The Associated Press cannot independently verify their conclusions.",
  "Here's the full letter:\n\nWhite House\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Stephen Braun contributed to this report.",
  "Of the pageant, he said, ''I had it in Moscow long time ago, but other than that I have nothing to do with Russia.\"",
