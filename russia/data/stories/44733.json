  "Maybe Facebook won’t be forever, but what my colleague Rebecca Rosen wrote in 2011 still stands today: “Our discomfort grows commensurate with Facebook’s power, such that the more that Facebook is indispensable, the greater our discomfort, and yet the less that discomfort matters.”\n\nIn this context, the last 18 months make more sense: Civil societies are struggling against Facebook not because the company is weaker than it has been in the past, but because it grows ever more powerful.",
  "“And what’s most important in winning budgets is relative performance in the industry.”\n\nAs long as dollars going into the Facebook ad machine sell products, dollars will keep going into the Facebook ad machine.",
  "A method of communication that was universally seen as a great way of exchanging information has been transformed into a rarity reserved for close friends, special occasions, emergencies, and debt collectors.",
  "So, as millions of companies attest, Facebook (and Instagram) ads can do well, especially if they use Facebook’s full suite of products for measuring the precise financial outcomes advertisers are pushing.",
  "And even if one could get free of the service, the social pathways that existed before Facebook have shriveled up, like the towns along the roads that preceded the interstate highway system.",
  "Despite personal reservations about Facebook’s interwoven privacy, data, and advertising practices, the vast majority of people find that they can’t (and don’t want to) quit.",
  "Most of the general pressures on the internet industry’s data practices, whether from Europe or anywhere else, don’t seem to scare Facebook.",
  "“The thing that won’t change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest [return-on-investment] opportunity,” Sandberg said.",
  "Opt out of Facebook, and all those other places are still mining your online profile, and often selling it to the highest bidder.",
  "Just look at how the very meaning of the telephone call has changed as we’ve expanded the number of ways we talk with each other.",
  "Facebook has rewired people’s lives, routing them through its servers, and to disentangle would require major sacrifice.",
  "As long as their friends are still on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, people will keep using Facebook products.",
  "Even if one were to quit the core service, there are many other ways of being roped into the Facebook ecosystem.",
  "Hundreds of companies create data about people on the internet from Google to umpteen obscure little companies.",
  "The company’s financial performance is more of a reflection of Facebook’s unstoppability than its cause.",
  "They have all the data, as fresh as it can be, with comparisons possible across 2 billion other people.",
  "There’s Instagram and WhatsApp, sure, but the company also maintains “shadow profiles” on refuseniks.",
  "Facebook rents out access to your attention, but it doesn’t give Nike or Pottery Barn your data.",
  "In the past, tech empires have risen and fallen, once momentum starts to work against them.",
  "In the company’s conference call with analysts last week, Sheryl Sandberg summed it up.",
  "This protects users to some extent and makes Facebook even more central and powerful.",
  "Their relative position will still be secure, unless something radical changes.",
  "Besides, the rest of the digital-advertising sharks would still be circling.",
  "IBM has been contracting for much of the decade.",
  "Intel is a shadow of its former self.",
  "Most are accountable to no one."
