  "The current chair of the European umbrella group of privacy watchdogs, the Austrian data protection chief Andrea Jelinek, said the incident is “a very serious allegation with far-reaching consequences\" and that all European authorities \"will work together in this process.”",
  "EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourová in Brussels | Emmanel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images EU justice chief laments ‘communist’ voter manipulation by Cambridge Analytica Commissioner Vera Jourová may have little power to act on her concerns.",
  "European Parliament President Antonio Tajani previously said his institution will also “investigate fully” the reports and called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to come to the Parliament to explain the companies' position.",
  "Facebook already face cases and investigations in other countries, including Germany, and could face additional queries if users complain over the misuse of their data to national data protection authorities.",
  "Jourová will send a letter to Facebook Friday asking the social media company for explanations to \"several questions\" on how privacy rights were treated when it shared data with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Barring that letter and some soft political pressure on U.S. authorities to investigate, the Commission can't do much right now but support national regulators in their investigations into the case.",
  "But Facebook's mismanagement and Cambridge Analytica's misuse of data wouldn't fall under these new rules, the commissioner stressed, because the actions happened before the law took effect.",
  "EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourová plans to confront Facebook over its new data mining scandal, comparing Cambridge Analytica's political campaigns with communist indoctrination programs.",
  "\"I made the clear message the EU expects the FTC to investigate this case,\" Jourová said, adding \"Facebook is a subscriber of [an EU-U.S. agreement to transfer data called] privacy shield.",
  "She said the case was a test for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces data protection rules in this case, to show it was serious about respecting European privacy standards.",
  "Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the center of the scandal over data mining, is signed up to privacy shield, exposing the mechanism's weak enforcement powers.",
  "The British Information Commissioner's Office said previously it would also investigate whether Cambridge Analytica, which is U.K.-based, committed fraud.",
  "When I look at the list of features that Cambridge Analytica was monitoring and following, they are digging into the intimate soul of individuals.\"",
  "The new law is designed to increase privacy protections for internet users and impose a series of new requirements on companies handling data.",
  "Jourová also put pressure on U.S. authorities to investigate Facebook over the data mining debacle during a visit to Washington this week.",
  "The mechanism requires companies to pledge they follow EU data protection rules, and the U.S. to check if this is the case.",
  "\"We cannot apply the sanctions that will be applicable under GDPR [and] the U.K.'s maximum sanction is up to £500,000.\"",
  "The new regime also comes with new, high fines that could reach into the billions of euros in the case of tech giants.",
  "But privacy groups and data protection authorities have criticized the Commission over loopholes in the system.",
  "\"People have been manipulated,\" she said, adding that \"people on Facebook appear to be naked.",
  "The EU is preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation to take effect in May.",
  "\"I am myself horrified,\" the Czech commissioner told reporters in Brussels Thursday.",
  "\"We expect that we will get the information from them on what happened,\" she said.",
  "\"I come from a former communist country and I still remember manipulation ...",
  "Privacy shield allows companies to transfer data from the EU to the U.S.",
  "Jourová said: \"That's why I expect the enforcers to do their job.",
  "The FTC said this week it is launching an inquiry into Facebook.",
  "For us, this is an important moment to see the FTC is acting.\"",
  "Such a company needs to be withdrawn from the system.\"",
  "She may have little real power to act, however.",
  "This is what threatens me most about this.\""
