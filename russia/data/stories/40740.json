  "Page is an energy consultant.” Per NBC’s Kristen Welker, Page released this statement: “Consistent with the politically motivated unmasking standards seen in the Obama administration which have recently been exposed, my personal identity and earlier assistance of federal authorities in the 2015 case of USA vs. BURYAKOV, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY was framed in an easily identifiable way that amplified the reputational damage against me.”\n\nSusan Rice is back in the news, too: “White House lawyers last month learned that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign,” Bloomberg’s Eli Lake reported.",

  "Consider these three stories in the past 24 hours:\n\nBlackwater founder, the Seychelles, and Russia: “The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladi­mir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials,” the Washington Post reports.",
  "Person One.’”\n\nUnmasking isn’t leaking — and it certainly isn’t wiretapping\n\nThe New York Times: Trump’s “broadside against his predecessor coincided with a string of reports in conservative news media outlets that Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, requested the identities of Americans who were cited in intelligence reports about surveillance of foreign officials, and who were connected with Mr. Trump’s campaign or transition.",
  "The process of ‘unmasking’ Americans whose names are redacted in intelligence reports, they said, is not the same thing as leaking them publicly.”\n\nStill at DEFCON 1: Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster Gorsuch\n\nWith yesterday’s Senate announcements, NBC’s Capitol Hill team can now count 42 Democratic senators saying they will vote to filibuster Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court — enough to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination.",
  "Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions.” The Trump White House has said that it wasn’t aware of Prince’s meetings, and that he had no role in the transition.",

  "So not only does Congress have to cram to keep the government open later this month, this also means that ANY window to make another health-care push is very small this month, especially if Republicans want to minimize the noise they get from their constituents back home.",
  "“The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on ‘unmasking’ the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally.",
  "If Senate Democrats filibuster his nomination we will likely see Republicans use the so-called “nuclear option” to lower the threshold to invoke cloture, something Senate Democrats did in 2013 for all nominees other than Supreme Court nominees.",
  "“The adviser, Carter Page, met with a Russian intelligence operative named Victor Podobnyy, who was later charged by the US government alongside two others for acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government.",
  "The president said he is talking to moderate and conservative Republicans and thinks he can get a deal.”\n\nBoy, that escalated quickly — Russia edition\n\nThe leaks and counter-leaks are something else right now.",
