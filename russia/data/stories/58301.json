Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said last week that committee Democrats will release their own memo, claiming the Republicans’ document “represents another effort to distract from the Russia probe and … seeks to selectively and misleadingly characterize classified information in an effort to protect the president at any cost.”\n\nRequests for surveillance warrants are made through the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, also known as the FISA court, and target suspected foreign spies inside the United States.",

  "… If you are interested in who paid for the dossier … then, yes, you'll want the memo to come out,” Gowdy told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nThe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence convened Monday evening and is expected to take a vote on whether to release the memo.",

  "However, he asked: “Do you want to know whether or not the primary source in these court proceedings had a bias against one [presidential] candidate?”\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",
  "Steele was hired by the U.S. firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the research with funding from the Democratic National Committee and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.",
  "According to one source, Wray was asked to point out inaccuracies or other issues with the wording -- and said he would need “his people to take a look at it.” The source said the review is ongoing.",
  "Gowdy, chairman of the House oversight committee, also said Sunday that he advised House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to have the FBI review the memo before its release.",
  "Those who have seen the document suggest it reveals what role the unverified anti-Trump \"dossier\" played in the application for a surveillance warrant on at least one President Trump associate.",

  "But South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, who helped write the four-page memo, said Sunday he wants it made public.",

  "The committee, with 13 Republican and nine Democratic members, is expected to vote yes.",
  "The president then would decide whether he has any objections.",
  "“We don’t know what’s in the memo."
