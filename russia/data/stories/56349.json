  "The latest round of pressure for new investigations gained steam last week, when Judicial Watch and then the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) released the latest fruit of a federal lawsuit against the Justice Department — email traffic inside the agency about the June 2016 decision by Bill Clinton to walk across the tarmac at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport and have a conversation with then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.",
  "“Senator Grassley has publicly written the Justice Department several times since 2015, citing news reports about Mr. Blumenthal’s alleged activities with respect to foreign interests, and never received any contact from Mr. Blumenthal about it until now, nor any substantive response other than the Justice Department’s noting that its Foreign Agents Registration Act Unit was aware of the news reports,” Hartmann said.",
  "“There is clear evidence that the main stream media was colluding with the DOJ to bury the story.”\n\nIn a pattern similar to the long-running investigation of the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, the emails have turned up not the redacted talking points but evidence that public affairs officers in the Justice Department, FBI and White House were communicating on how to spin the story.",
  "“In light of current events, it appears to have been instigated as a means to distract and diminish the public attention from the Russian intervention in the presidential election of 2016.”\n\nIn an emailed statement, Grassley spokesman George Hartmann said that the fault was with Blumenthal for declining to explain himself.",
  "“The Justice Department never explained why it failed to require Mr. Blumenthal and his partner, John Kornblum, to register under FARA.”\n\nIn a letter, which he copied to The Washington Post, Blumenthal demanded an apology from Grassley, saying he had never represented Georgia Dream or partnered with Kornblum.",
  "“In his letters, and at the recent hearing on the Justice Department’s failure to adequately enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Senator Grassley cited news reports and noted that if Mr. Blumenthal did not have to register, the Justice Department should explain why not in order to be fair to him.",
  "“It is clear that there were multiple records within the FBI responsive to our request and that discussions regarding the surreptitious meeting between then AG Lynch and the husband of the subject of an ongoing FBI criminal investigation reached the highest levels of the FBI,” Sekulow wrote.",
  "Mr. Blumenthal should direct his attention to the news reports and the Justice Department rather than a senator who cited the reports in the context of whether the Justice Department has been as transparent as it should be with the American people’s business.”\n\nBlumenthal’s letter is below.",
  "But remember that she never recused herself from the actual outcome of the proceeding.”\n\nOn the Tuesday episode of his radio talk show, Rush Limbaugh focused on the dismissive tone reporters used to ask questions of the government spinners and the Lynch email alias.",
  "(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nNine months after Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton to win the presidency, congressional Republicans and conservative legal watchdogs are continuing to probe the scandals that dogged the Democratic campaign.",
  "The meeting, first reported by a local news station that also reported being told not to photograph Lynch or Clinton, caused an instant scandal, despite a hasty attempt by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to describe the meeting as nonpolitical.",
  "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2017\n\nSeparately, the Senate and House judiciary committees have been carrying out or exploring investigations into aspects of the 2016 campaign and Clinton’s years at the State Department.",
  "On Nov. 2, six days before the presidential election, ACLJ chief counsel Jay Sekulow announced that he would be suing for documents after the Justice Department and FBI claimed that a Freedom of Information Request turned up nothing.",
  "On July 26, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) held hearings on the Foreign Agent Registration Act, suggesting that as an aide to Clinton at the State Department, Sidney Blumenthal carried out lobbying activity but never registered.",
  "In July, before the start of the August recess, the House committee hollowed out a Democratic resolution intended to expand the investigation of Comey’s firing and replaced it with one demanding answers about Clinton.",
  "“You have a responsibility to yourself as well to me and to the American public to determine who gave you this false information, encouraged you to make your recent statement and the reason why,” Blumenthal wrote.",
  "“Does this potentially expose its own version of collusion that they’re trying to cover up the fact they were in the fix, if you will, for Hillary Clinton and they didn’t want it exposed?” asked Sean Hannity.",
  "That seems to be building a case.”\n\nSekulow said: “Yes, but add to that also, Sean, that the basis upon which James Comey said he went public was because of these meetings that we’ve got the documents on now.",
  "(The ACLJ has also “unmasked” an email pseudonym Lynch sometimes used, though that’s not uncommon for high-profile public officials, and the emails were obviously discoverable as part of lawsuits.)",
  "That’s the reason he said he made that public statement, because he said the integrity of the agency, the FBI, was put at risk, and the Department of Justice, by Loretta Lynch’s action.",
  "On Friday, Sekulow, who is now a member of the president’s legal team and a frequent advocate for him on television, reported that the lawsuit had turned up hundreds of pages of emails.",
  "“News articles reported that Mr. Blumenthal transmitted documentation to Secretary Clinton on behalf of the Georgian Dream, a political party in the country of Georgia,” Grassley said.",
  "“It turns out these people are using aliases, fake names so that they would not be discovered,” he said, overstating the meaning of the attorney general’s dummy email.",
  "And in conservative media, the churn of possible investigations has created a news cycle that operates independently of the one seen in most of the press.",
  "On Monday night, Sekulow appeared on Fox’s “Hannity,” which frequently editorializes on the need for more Clinton investigations, to share the findings.",
  "E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.",
  "Later in the day, the president himself drew attention to the lawsuits, without naming them.",
  "Yet, since Nov. 8, Trump has tweeted about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton many times.",
  "“And add to that that it’s not an investigation, it’s a matter?",
  "Donald Trump won the presidential election."
