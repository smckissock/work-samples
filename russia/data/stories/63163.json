  "The indictment also referenced a U.S. person who \"was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump\" and exchanging messages with the conspirators, who were posing as Guccifer 2.0.",
  "Earlier Friday, the longtime Republican strategist told The Hill that his messages with Guccifer 2.0, which Stone admitted to having exchanged in the past, were \"benign based on its content context and timing.\"",

  "But he denied he was the person named in Friday's indictment \"because I wasn't in regular contact with members of the Trump campaign,\" The Hill reported.",
  "He told CNN he hadn't read the \"extensive document\" and \"misunderstood\" the reference to the messages when he denied being the unnamed person.",
  "Stone maintained that the exchange was benign in his interview with CNN, and acknowledged he was in contact with Trump campaign officials.",
  "In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Stone said that he's \"probably\" the person named in the filing.",
  "The messages were included in the indictment, raising speculation that Stone was the unnamed person."
