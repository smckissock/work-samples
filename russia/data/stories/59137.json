  "So, this is the president's presentation at a moment when the Democrats are saying $25 billion, you just got a huge tax cut, now, you want to $25 billion for a wall that essentially is symbolic --\n\nWALLACE: So, are using the Democrats -- I mean, on the other hand, 2 million people in this country illegally, even the Dreamers, as sympathetic as they are, are in the country illegally, you are saying Democrats shouldn't jump on this deal?",
  "When you hear what we just heard from Marc Short about what the president is going to say in his State of the Union speech, that he's going to take a victory lap for a strong economic numbers, he's going to talk about infrastructure and creating jobs, he's going to talk about immigration reform, how strong a message for this year and how strong a message for Republicans to run on in November?",
  "WALLACE: But let me -- let me -- let me pick up on this because the reports are, and you kind of indicated that in your answer, that the memo centers on this question of the FISA application, the Department of Justice FBI application in 2016 for a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance against this fellow, then Trump campaign manager Carter Page.",
  "One thing that Juan touched on that was absolutely right, the Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus are going to fight hard to defend the diversity lottery because lotteries are weird, but diversity means we draw people from countries that don't normally flow in to the normal immigration flow, largely African countries.",
  "One, does the president believe that's true, that there has been abuse, that there has been bias in the investigations, and two, as The Washington Post reports today, does he want to see that four-page memo to that effect coming out of the House Intelligence Committee, does he want to see that release to the public?",
  "WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, how much legal jeopardy for the president when he sits down in this interview, given the fact that he has told different stories about why he fired Comey, questions about, you know, when -- when he kicked everybody else out of the room, did he tell him to go easy on Mike Flynn or not?",
  "WALLACE: I want to -- I want to -- I want to -- and I don't mean to interrupt, sir, but I've got two more questions I want to get to and we're running out of time, because I want to address those texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who were two key figures in both the Clinton and Trump investigations.",
  "WALLACE: I want to pick up on that because there was a report this weekend that the White House wants to scale back, when you say regulations, environmental regulations, and critics say the effect is that in order to get these projects going, you would gut the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.",
  "WALLACE: I just want to button up one question about the release of the memo, because the assistant attorney general sent a note to the special -- to the House Intelligence Committee saying it would be, quote, extraordinarily reckless to release that memo because it may reveal sources and methods.",
  "WALLACE: For all of your plans for 2018, for all of the victory lap the president is going to take for the economy and what was accomplished in 2017, I think it's fair to say that there is a cloud that continues to hang over this White House, and that's the Russian investigation.",

  "These same two people who were so biased they should be kicked to the curb immediately were the ones interviewing Hillary Clinton, editing the memo to take out references to President Obama, editing the memo to take out the reference to grossly negligent.",
  "And when you have people like Senator Perdue as Marc Short pointed out, and you have Senator Cotton in particular saying this is a good solid framework --\n\nWALLACE: Yes, we just pointed out, two Republican really strong hardliners on immigration issues.",

  "We believe that right now, you're right, the courts have said that the March 5th is not there, but if another court overrules, they are not going to have the six-month grace period that this president offered Congress to fix it.",
  "Congressman Chaffetz, how do you answer Al and the concern from some conservatives that the president is giving away too much to the Dreamers when he gives them a path to citizenship, which is, again, more than Barack Obama did?",
  "I don't know that I can pass in the House quite as smoothly, but if all the Democrats get behind it in the House that I think there are enough in the House on the Republican side of the aisle that they could actually pass this.",

  "What I have to prove to you is, two really important people hated him, would have done anything to protect her and thank God Michael Horowitz found out about them while they were investigating the president.",

  "But second, in that meeting that you televised, at the White House, when the president had 20 members of Congress over, he said, I will provide cover from our side on this issue.",
  "How was he received there and how much are they counting on the strong economic recovery, the good numbers from 2017 continuing to 2018 to help Republicans in the 2018 midterms?",

  "WALLACE (voice over): Zeller says whether we keep faith with combat translators will send a message, will this country protect or abandon people who help us in future conflicts?",
  "The president doesn't help by tweeting about Schumer, but Schumer doesn't help by going to the floor and Nancy Pelosi's comment was so over-the-top, I'm for immigration reform.",
  "And in the end, though, do they really think they have any choice that he's going to just both politically and legally have to sit down and -- and talk to the special counsel?",
  "WALLACE: Would the White House object if Congress decided on his own to pass a bill to protect the status of the special counsel, to make it harder or impossible to fire him?",

  "If you're Adam Schiff, who is consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure -- he didn't want us to find out any of this information, Chris.",
  "So these same two people, whose bias was so insidious that Bob Mueller fired them the second he found out about it, there bias existed the entire time.",
  "And he will also talk about American strength, the fact that we are continuing to wipe out ISIS, but that we have growing threats, such as North Korea.",
