  "Issouf Sanogo / AFP / Getty Images Burkina Faso troops stand guard outside the Splendid hotel and the nearby Cappuccino restaurant\n\nThe attack claimed by the regional faction of al-Qaeda — who have competed with Islamic State for the loyalty of Islamist insurgents across the region — suggests regional jihadist groups are increasingly gunning for soft targets in rival attempts to grab the global limelight.",
  "For the next two hours, gunmen from al-Qaeda’s North African branch, known as AQIM, unleashed a sophisticated attack that killed at least 29 people from 18 countries, left double that number injured, and roiled a country that has so far largely escaped the militant Islamist attacks and abductions that have plagued its neighbors.",
  "The hours-long rampage in Ouagadougou also called into question the ability of the landlocked country, which houses both a U.S. drone base and French special forces, to respond to a spillover of the jihadis who operate in clusters arcing across the Sahel, from Mali in the west as far as Somalia on the continent’s eastern coast.",
  "“Just recently over the last few months, we’d started getting groups of peaux clairs,” — French for ‘light-skinned,’ a local term used to distinguish Tuaregs, an ethnic group who traditionally roam the Sahara where Islamists groups have flourished in recent years, and Arabs from darker skinned compatriots.",
  "“AQIM and al-Mourabitoun seem to be refining their tactics, and showing that they can cause significant damage and mayhem with a relatively small number of fighters in regional capitals,” said Andrew Lebovich, a regional security expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
  "The French gentleman was just very lucky because the jihadi preferred to go back to a roomful of people rather than concentrate on finding one individual who had escaped,” he said, adding that the French customer initially hid in the toilet.",
  "The assault in Ouagadougou took place at the Hotel Splendid, a five-storey building frequented by United Nations staff and French soldiers with Operation Barkhane, the former colonial power’s counter-insurgency operation across the Sahel.",
  "Issouf Sanogo / AFP / Getty Images A picture shows the Cappuccino restaurant following a jihadist attack in Ouagadougou\n\nStéphane Balkouma wasn’t worried when the first volley of gunshots rang out just before 8pm on Friday night.",
  "He continued praying even after Balkouma, the salesman, opened his office door and ushered them in, asking them to switch off their phones so the ringing wouldn’t attract the attention of the gunmen working methodically below.",
  "Each time anyone moved, they’d fire — one step and they’d fire.”\n\n“Then we heard an explosion, a horrible explosion…they’d put explosives all over the place,” said the man, who was at the restaurant with his girlfriend.",
  "In November, 20 guests were killed in another luxury hotel attack in neighbouring Mali after it was stormed by gunmen from al-Mourabitoun, a group that briefly splintered from al-Qaeda before rejoining them.",
  "“Throughout the hotel siege, there was also sporadic shooting from around the block, as if the jihadis wanted to let the [soldiers] know, ‘we’re out here, we’re watching,’” Nagreogo said.",
  "I was thinking there’d be a bunch of soldiers in trucks,” he said, recalling an attempted coup late last year as the country went to its first free elections in almost three decades.",
  "Ahmed Ouoba / AFP / Getty Images A wounded man receives medical care outside the Splendid hotel\n\nOn the ground floor below Balkouma’s office, a waiter was cowering on the floor.",
  "Witnesses spoke to BuzzFeed News of the horror of the hours-long siege on hotel and restaurant that left at least 29 people, mostly foreigners, dead in the West African nation.",
  "The air conditioner salesman went and stood on the balcony of his second-floor office overlooking the main avenue in downtown Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s dusty capital.",
  "“They would come and get their coffee in groups of three or four, but we didn’t think anything of it,” the waiter said, adding that the men were all in their early 20s.",
  "Cars parked on the hibiscus shrub-lined streets had caught fire as the militants, whom witnesses said were in their early 20s, repeatedly lobbed grenades into them.",
  "By now, at least two other gunmen had entered the Splendid Hotel, which lies across from the Cappuccino and is one of a handful of luxury hotels in Burkina Faso.",
  "The assault was carried out as \"revenge against France and the disbelieving West,\" AQIM said in a statement, according to the SITE Intelligence Group website.",
  "Burkinabe soldiers, accompanied by around three dozen French special forces, eventually arrived and an intense gunfight ensued until the early morning.",
  "The waiter, who asked for his name not to be used out of fear of future attacks, had been assigned to a bustling table of 14 foreigners, mostly French.",
  "They were absolutely prepared to go to paradise today if need be,” said Balkouma, who said he had crouched behind his office blinds to watch them.",
  "Albert Nagreogo, a journalist who rushed to the hotel when the news broke, said the rampage continued uninterrupted for at least another hour.",
  "“After the first volley I was lying on the ground and I noticed it was just slow shots, one at a time, one at a time,” he said by telephone.",
  "It was a Friday night, and a particularly busy one at the Cappuccino, a restaurant was popular with foreigners and moneyed locals alike.",
  "On the same evening, an Australian doctor and his wife were snatched by gunmen near the northern border with Mali.",
  "(Bar a handful of skirmishes in remote northern outposts, there had been just one abduction by radical Islamists.)",
  "“He just went back to reloading his gun.”\n\n“They wanted to kill foreigners, white people — that much was clear.\"",
  "A child lay over the slumped bodies of his parents, a visibly shocked diner said in a video posted on Facebook.",
  "Terrorist attacks are so alien that emergency workers at first didn’t realize one was underway, witnesses said.",
  "Like the 60-odd diners in the cafe, he’d instinctively thrown himself to the ground at the burst of gunfire.",
  "From there, he scrambled up the nearest fire escape stairs to the second floor, where his legs gave way.",
  "They also told BuzzFeed News that the gunmen at times combed through the crowds looking for foreigners.",
  "At least one other militant was located somewhere outside the hotel, two witnesses told BuzzFeed News.",
  "\"There were two men wearing turbans, holding AK47s, walking very calmly and slowly towards the hotel.",
  "In the deathly silence broken only by the sound of a gun being reloaded, the waiter raised his head.",
  "The waiter decided then to also run, making for a back door that opened into a central courtyard.",
  "Among them was a French national who looked up to see a jihadi pointing his gun at him.",
  "I understood immediately that they were jihadis,” he told BuzzFeed News by phone.",
  "Watching beside him, the waiter realized something that made his blood go cold.",
  "“With the smoke everything was just…” he trailed off and shook his head mutely.",
  "He huddled in the corridor with 14 other escapees, praying under his breath.",

  "“It was horrible.” The air was thick with smoke.",

  "What Balkouma saw instead chilled him.",
  "The French national got up and ran.",
  "His bullet chamber was empty.",
  "“I assumed it was a coup.",
  "I was shocked."
