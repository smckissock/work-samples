  "“The Founders never envisioned that a separate office inside the executive branch could hire a bunch of agenda-driven investigators, in search of a crime, by the head of the executive branch [Trump],” Ingraham said, and then called on FBI Deputy Director McCabe to be fired over many things, including his apparent role in planning to “subvert Trump’s campaign, or if elected, his ability to lead the government as president of the United States.”\n\nAlthough she said she is tempted, Ingraham did not call for Mueller to be fired, but did say his investigation is “irreparably tainted” and needs to be investigated.",
  "Laura Ingraham ripped into the “irreparably tainted” Mueller investigation into Russian collusion with the claim that it is now an example of “how big government can end up becoming a threat to a representative democracy.”\n\nOn her Thursday night edition of The Ingraham Angle, Fox News’s latest primetime star opened with a blistering breakdown of the gobsmacking corruption and conflict of interest that has fueled, not only Hillary Clinton’s exoneration over her email scandal, but Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation into Russian collusion.",
  "With only an hour show, Ingraham could not hit on everything, but this “insurance policy” has also manifested itself through inexcusable leaks of President Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders and Mueller’s apparent desire to derail the (successful) Senate vote on tax reform by announcing, on the morning of the vote, his plea bargain (for a process crime) with Michael Flynn, Trump’s former National Security Adviser.",
  "This exchange occurred in the heart of the 2016 presidential election, and these texts relate directly to the idea of stopping Donald Trump from becoming president, to an “insurance policy” if he is elected, to an FBI Agent promising to “protect our country” from Trump on “many levels.”\n\nThis is stuff of banana republics and their secret police.",
  "Worse still, earlier that same month, Lisa Page (a key player in Mueller’s Russia probe) texted to Strzok: “Maybe you’re meant to stay where you are because you’re meant to protect the country from that menace [Trump].”\n\n“I can protect our country at many levels,” Strzok replied.",
  "Specifically, Ingraham pointed to text messages written by FBI Agent Peter Strzok in August of 2016 that read: “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way [Trump] gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.",
  "Strzok then, inexplicably, became a top investigator for Mueller’s Russia probe, and Mueller only became a special prosecutor after Comey illegally leaked confidential notes to the news media in the hopes the appointment of a special prosecutor would be the result.",
  "Moreover, at this point, Clinton had spent millions to put together the phony Russia dossier that was almost certainly used by the FBI and the Obama administration to obtain the warrants necessary to spy on their political opponents in the Trump campaign.",
  "Focusing specifically on the Strzok’s “insurance policy” reassurance to Lisa Page, and calling this text a “smoking gun,” Ingraham broke down exactly how that “insurance” has manifested itself over the last 18 months.",
  "If that is not bad enough, in 2015, when FBI Deputy Director McCabe’s wife ran for state senate in Virginia, longtime Clintonista Terry McAuliffe funneled some $675, 000 into her campaign.",
  "It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”\n\nStrzok is referring to what was obviously a political meeting in FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s office.",
  "And if that is not bad enough, Bruce Ohr, a top Justice Department official, is married to Nellie Ohr, who worked for Fusion GPS to put together the discredited Russian dossier.",
  "If not, she believes his investigation “will and should” collapse over these “endless revelations of bias.”\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.",
  "And if it meant deploying the entire mainstream media apparatus into Defcon 1 mode; hyper-ventilating about Russian collusion 24/7, they’d do it.",
  "Strzok would go on to play a key role in aiding and abetting former FBI Director James Comey’s inexplicable exoneration of Hillary Clinton.",
  "Or maybe spreading damaging falsehoods with anonymous sources that are later parroted and then retracted by major news organizations.",
  "And today, if it means floating a specious story alleging that the president has early on-set dementia, they’ll do that too.",
  "And if that meant applying for a FISA warrant based on a phony dossier in order to spy on the campaign, maybe they’d do it.",
  "Hovering over all of this is the number of Hillary Clinton donors hired by Mueller to investigate the man who beat her.",
  "Ingraham then moved into what this “insurance policy” looks like today as a means to stop Trump from governing.",
  "The following year, Strzok watered down the language that exonerated Hillary for her prosecutable email crimes.",
  "As former Mueller investigator Peter Strzok put it, they needed an “insurance policy” to stop Trump.",
  "They were intent on preventing him from being elected by any means necessary.",
  "Another conflict of interest is that Mueller and Comey are close friends.",
  "Follow his Facebook Page here.",
  "Yeah, they’ll do that too.",
  "… Whatever it takes."
