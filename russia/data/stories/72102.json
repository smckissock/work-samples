  "It was before the reorganization that led to the national security division and so this is someone who was right there in that post-9/11 crucible with men like Robert Mueller, with men like Jim Comey and many people don't realize that Christopher Wray actually in the famous 2004 hospital incident that saw James Comey and Robert Mueller prepared to resign over the NSA domestic program that Christopher Wray, who was assistant attorney general then, was prepared to resign with them.",
  "BALDWIN: So given everything you've just told me and the fact that Wray, according to our justice correspondent, is saying Wray's frustrated, top White House officials are worried he'll resign over this because you have this clash of the president of the United States who wants to get this memo out there to discredit the Mueller investigation and you have the top of the FBI saying no.",
  "This memo, though, what we believe it contains is sort of the idea that Republicans on the House Intel Committee are alleging that basically the FBI took the Steele dossier and signed \"me want warrant\" across the top of the document and handed it in to a federal judge who rubber stamped it and sent it off to be implemented as a FISA warrant.",
  "What I've said, what I said Friday, last Friday, or a week ago tomorrow, was if the immigration issue was not resolved inside the global discussions that the speaker's been talking about that we had going on, which the Democrats have trying to shoehorn the immigration issue into that collection of discussions.",
  "What it is, is the Congress's legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the FISA process is being used correctly and that if it wasn't being used correctly, that needs to come to light and people need to be held accountable so we do not have problems again because this does affect our civil liberties.",
  "I think it's quite notable, Brooke, that Christopher Wray is right now standing there by himself, the FISA process, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process, since Watergate, has been the only legal way for U.S. intelligence agencies to gather foreign intelligence information on U.S. persons.",
  "What this memo is, is Congress doing its job in conducting legitimate oversight over a very unique law FISA and if mistakes were made and if individuals did something wrong then it is our job as the legislative branch of government to conduct oversight over the executive branch if abuses were made.",
  "And as Amanda said, I'm old enough to remember two years ago when Carter Page was unidentified male number one on the audio tapes that the FBI made of Russian SVR agents speaking in the New York resident Torah (ph) about trying to recruit Carter Page as an asset to Russian intelligence.",
  "We also have to make sure if there are certain individuals who did the wrong thing, who either brought bias or cut corners or did something wrong that implicates American civil liberties, it is our job as congressional overseers to bring people to account so it doesn't happen again.",
  "And I think it's really notable that you're not seeing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, you're not seeing NSA Director Mike Rogers, you're not seeing CIA Director Mike Pompeo --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Come behind him and say we agree with you don't release the memo.",
  "GRAFF: One of the things that's important to remember in this is that the FBI's objection isn't so much the sources and methods, that the redactions, even if they exist, even if they happen, the FBI's objection, Christopher Wray's objection is that its fundamentally misleading.",
  "GARRETT GRAFF, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think that there was a perhaps a misunderstanding last summer when Christopher Wray was initially put up for this job that he was going to be some sort of sympathetic Trump stooge, sort of a Trump plant at the White House.",
  "If those are not resolved, I'm perfectly happy, provided the government is still open on February the 8th, to go to the subject and to treat it in a fair way, not try to tilt the playing field in anybody's direction, and we'll see who can get to 60 votes.",
  "Again, like we're all just speculating and everybody's playing politics with it based on a memo written by Devin Nunes's staff who's already been caught misleading the public about intelligence matters because of tampering from the White House.",
  "One of my favorite old Kentucky country saying there's no education in the second kick of a mule, and so I think there will be a new level of seriousness here in trying to resolve these issues the speaker outlined as we go forward.",
  "So I think Speaker Ryan is possibly trying to thread the needle here in saying this doesn't have to do with the campaign or the investigation into Trump's campaign because Carter Page wasn't a member of a campaign at the time.",
  "I would almost quit asking questions about the memo until we see the stupid thing --\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n-- and pay more attention until, you know --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTAKL)\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: The Trump Tower meeting is much more concerning.",
  "Speaking of the stupid thing, to quote you, we're now hearing the administration official saying the White House will tell Congress that the release of this memo is probably tomorrow and so there you have, probably tomorrow.",
  "\n\n\n\nReturn to Transcripts main page\n\nCNN NEWSROOM\n\nWhite House Worried FBI Chief Could Quit Over Memo Release; Ryan, McConnell Speak at Retreat; Briefing on Nunes Memo; Trump Sees Nunes Memo as Way to Discredit Russia Probe.",
  "And if there are institutions or -- excuse me -- if there are instances or individuals who have abused that power, it is our job in Congress to shed light on that and bring transparency and accountability to the process.",
  "\"The FBI Agents Association appreciates FBI Director Chris Wray standing shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of the FBI as we work together to protect our country from criminal and national security threats.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: One thing I would say, Republicans, if you're going on the Steele dossier, any way that could read the reports from the Carter Page can probably guess what was in the FISA application.",
  "Again, you heard my point, right, it's like Speaker Ryan says, no, no, no this doesn't affect the Mueller investigation with what we're hearing from the president is yes, yes, yes, this should discredit it.",
  "But that goes against what the president from the White House our sources is hoping it will absolutely discredit the Mueller investigation so let -- I've still got Garrett Graff hanging out with me.",
  "AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It seems to me that the Republicans getting behind releasing the memo are putting a lot of faith that is not deserved into Devin Nunes and Carter Page.",
  "Devin Nunes helped shepherd through a reauthorization of 702, which is the foreign terrorist form surveillance law, so he's focused on keeping our country safe, focused on national security.",
  "Remember, FISA is a unique situation which involves Americans civil liberties and if American civil liberties were abused, then that needs to come to light so that that doesn't happen again.",
  "Starting with the Supreme Court, now 13 circuit judges, but the 12 we did last year were the most in the first year of any administration since the circuit courts were established in 1891.",
  "This is someone who was the assistant attorney general for the criminal division in the years after 9/11, which was actually the unit overseeing the counterterrorism portfolio at the time.",
  "And even if we get everything figured out by Tuesday, we still have to have a C.R., if only for the fact that we have to get the appropriators time to write an omnibus appropriations bill.",
  "And if you prefer a right-of-center America, as virtually every Republican does, there was never a better year than 2017 in the time I've been here, which would cover three decades.",
  "I think the speaker's done an excellent job of outlining all the good things that are coming about as a result of the comprehensive tax reform bill that we passed in December.",
  "Like I said to you on Tuesday, the men and women over at the Milwaukee office, at the field office of the FBI, they're the ones helping to keep opioids out of our school.",
  "Sources tell us the top White House aides are worried that the FBI director, Christopher Wray, could quit if a highly controversial Republican memo is, in fact, released.",
  "For first of all, the reason we're having these C.R.s in the first place is because the Democrats have been holding the cap agreement hostage for an unrelated issue.",
  "The question was the memo, it's important that we scrub these memos for any sources and methods that could reveal national security our compromise national security.",
  "And that is why the legislative branch of government, this dually elected branch of government, conducts its oversight over the executive branch of government.",
  "Garrett, that flies in the face, obviously, of what we heard from the public statement from the FBI, the semi-private meeting Monday night at the White House.",
  "He talks about transparency and this is an administration that hasn't had a solo press conference in a year or press briefing in the last week and a half.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Mr. Speaker, do you really believe that this memo has nothing at all to do and no impact on the special counsel's investigation.",
  "GRAFF: -- ascertained so far that this is a memo dealing with so- called abuses of the FISA process dealing with Carter Page as Amanda was just saying.",
  "I want to thank him, the vice president and all the members of the administration who have joined us here in West Virginia to talk about this agenda.",
  "REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: So take home pay is\n\n\n\ngoing up, wages are going up, benefits are going up, businesses are expanding.",
  "Think of it this way, taking your foot off the brake and putting it on the accelerator and giving America the opportunity to reach its potential.",
  "GRAFF: And he said, look, I know there's something going on here, when you pull the rip cord, make sure to tell me so that I can jump with you.",
  "Everyone pretty much suspects that this whole FISA debate has to do with whether FISA was appropriately obtained to keep tabs on Carter Page.",
  "This is the same Carter Page that was under FBI watch since 2013 when he was hanging out with Russian agents attempting to recruit Americans.",
  "The speaker said, \"This doesn't implicate the Mueller investigation, it doesn't implicate the DAG, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\"",
  "When a matter was brought to the attention of the committee, they addressed that matter, and then they went through the committee process.",
  "Sources say top White House aides are worried that FBI Director Christopher Wray could quit if this highly controversial memo is released.",
  "And we keep talking about his frustration, and we know that the president is frustrated because, obviously, he wants to release this memo.",
  "We want to make sure that Secretary Mattis, who we heard from this morning, has the tools and resources he needs to rebuild our military.",
  "I think that we -- in these stories often get caught up in, like, this is more Democratic/Republicans partisan squabbling in Washington.",
  "And that he knew that if Robert Mueller and James Comey were prepared to resign over something that it was worth resigning as well.",
  "In regard to, Brooke, about the Intelligence Committee, the only thing I found worse than Republicans in this matter are Democrats.",
  "And we remain focused on our important work to protect the country from terrorists and criminals, both domestic and international.",
  "Until I see their faces pop up and doing interviews rather than Matt Gerts (ph) in between interviews, I just don't believe it.",
  "We used the Congressional Review Act 15 times to try to deal with the regulatory rampage that occurred during the Obama years.",
  "That's the man of sort of in defense of the Justice Department's prerogatives as the defender of the Constitution that he is.",
  "Senator McConnell, have you seen the memo and secondly, do you agree with Senator -- (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nMCCONNELL: No, I haven't.",
  "So this is incredible power that the people of this country, through Congress, has given our executive branch of government.",
  "[14:40:06] MCCONNELL: I might just add, I don't think we'll see a threaten in government shutdown again over this subject.",
  "[14:35:19] SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Mr. Speaker, thanks for inviting us to join your retreat.",
  "So as long as we're not revealing sources and methods to protect our national security, the more transparency the better.",
  "Top-secret information, by definition, being something that if its release could cause grave damage to national security.",
  "BALDWIN: Wasn't he tiptoeing around the White House --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: Yes, he was jumping out of his car.",
  "And at the same time, as at the beginning, as I said, we keep saying it, but this is a tipping point for our democracy.",
  "And this is an administration that doesn't care about the democratic process or the FBI or the Department of Justice.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Any reaction to the reports that Nunes changed this memo after it was voted on?",
  "This is someone who this is not something that just popped up last summer and was rubber stamped by the FISA court.",
  "We're getting word that the Democrats are now claiming that Chairman Nunes made five material changes to this memo.",
  "And Carter Page has nothing to do with the Trump Tower meeting that really should be more concerning to everyone.",
  "And this is the line that I think is key that I just jotted down talking about this memo, right, and the release.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Where do you guys stand on -- (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\nRYAN: We've been both talking about the C.R.",
  "If you're going to show us and cherry pick information, then you're only -- you're only going to fan the flames.",
  "But one of the reasons we're here in West Virginia is because we want to build on this success of 2017 in 2018.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE) -- to remove Chairman Nunes from his position, what's your response to that?",
  "RYAN: They're just playing politics and they're looking for a political distraction is what I get out of that.",
  "And you've got the FBI -- and you may say a lot of things about the FBI, and I've covered them for 30 years.",
  "CNN political commentator, Amanda Carpenter, she's the former communications director for Senator Ted Cruz.",
  "GRAFF: That the memo leaves out key evidence, that it has omissions of fact, and that he has grave concern.",
  "This is an important Intelligence Community equity to defend the -- the sort of integrity of this process.",
  "As Director Wray noted, FBI special agents have remained steadfast in their dedication to professionalism.",
  "So you just had the top Republican both in the House and the Senate there and really mostly Speaker Ryan.",
  "These institutions, the Department of Justice, the FBI, very important institutions for the rule of law.",
  "He didn't know what the controversy was, but he stopped --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: He was with them.",
  "And the American public continues to be well served by the world's preeminent law enforcement agency.\"",
  "But it's also very important that we guard peoples' civil liberties as we exercise these institutions.",
  "We have to go on the South Lawn to try and get in touch with the president and shout questions at him.",
  "KAREM: Well, the appropriate thing --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Hey, maybe you're right on the money.",
  "Let me just say, the vast, vast, vast majority of the men and women of the FBI are doing a great job.",
  "So the people can see their civil liberties are being protected, the Constitution is being followed.",
  "CARPENTER: There are many other Republicans who are credible, who have experience on these issues.",
  "And that is why we're excited about having the president here today to work on this shared agenda.",
  "I especially want to thank Senator Mitch McConnell and our Senate colleagues for joining us here.",
  "So if we would've had our cap agreement in place by now we would not be having to do these C.R.s.",
  "You have an FBI director saying please don't release this memo, it is misleading and incomplete.",
  "This is about us holding the system accountable and reviewing whether or not FISA abuses occur.",
  "And CNN political analyst, Brian Karem, who is the executive editor for \"Sentinel Newspapers.\"",
  "UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Mr. Speaker, Republicans are traditionally the party of law and order.",
  "The more important thing is, again, don't listen, like what Amanda was talking about earlier.",
  "And we need to help people to move from welfare to work so they can tap their true potential.",
  "And finally, as the speaker outlined, the incredible success of this tax reform legislation.",
  "It is the reason for optimism, for growth, the opportunity to get our country growing again.",
  "How many people involved in the Mueller investigation has this president already gone after?",
  "Show me the credible Republicans willing to go out and do an interview and talk about this.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Immigration bill soon can you tell us which bill that's going to be?",
  "If you're going to be transparent, then you release the Democratic version of it as well.",
  "And let's keep in mind this wiretap was not obtained until Carter Page left the campaign.",
  "GRAFF: I think one of the things that it seems like -- again, we haven't seen this memo.",
  "But Christopher Wray has a long and distinguished history within the Justice Department.",
  "The FISA law title one, there's been some confusion about different titles in this law.",
  "We want to go to West Virginia where the House speaker is speaking at this conference.",
  "This law allows the government to go to a secret court to get a wiretap on a citizen.",
  "At the end of the day, people are going to be screaming on either side of the aisle.",
  "This is the same Carter Page that lied and misled about his meetings with Russians.",
  "And the employees all across the country are benefiting from what we did last fall.",
  "Having been here a while, I'm in a good position to compare 2017 with other years.",
  "It's like watching two Houses on fire and they're throwing gasoline on each other.",
  "And at the end of the day, if you're going to be transparent, show us everything.",
  "We have to make sure that this power is being exercised properly and judiciously.",
  "The government has been given extraordinary power over citizens' civil liberties.",
  "President Trump saying the memo should be released, it would pose a great danger.",
  "Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high while unemployment is at a 17-year low.",
  "You mentioned UPS, which happens to be the single biggest employer in Kentucky.",
  "Aired 2:30-3p ET\n\nAired February 1, 2018 - 14:30 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.",
  "just to give the Appropriations Committee time to write an appropriations bill.",
  "He has nothing to do with Michael Flynn lying about his contacts with Russians.",
  "If the head of the FBI you appointed is telling you not to do it, you don't do.",
  "Republicans say that they're minor, insignificant, and there will be no revote.",
  "Maybe they should do a Lexus Nexus search before they release this stupid memo.",
  "CARPENTER: I would say, for the Democrats, they better be substantive changes.",
  "Are we going to be a democracy after today or is this going to be demagoguery?",
  "We're very excited about making more progress for the American people in 2018.",
  "What this is not, is an indictment on our institutions of our justice system.",
  "It does not impugn the Mueller investigation or the deputy attorney general.",
  "In consultation with the FBI, they made a change to register those concerns.",
  "If you're not going to be transparent, you're not going to show us anything.",
  "I say let all of it out so long as we're not involving sources and methods.",
  "Having said all of that, I think we're making progress on a cap agreement.",
  "They would love nothing more than to play politics and change the subject.",
  "So with me, someone who actually knows Christopher Wray, is Garrett Graff.",
  "Special agents take a solemn oath to our country and to the Constitution.",
  "BRIAN KAREM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: And you're hearing that from the FBI.",
  "A big decoy to get people not to pay attention to the appropriate things.",
  "This is an administration that does not enjoy or respect the rule of law.",
  "Scrub to make sure that there are no sources and methods being revealed.",
  "First of all, let me tell\n\n\n\nyou what this memo is and what it is not.",
  "This memo is not indictment of the FBI, of the Department of Justice.",
  "GRAFF: This is something we've never seen in American history before.",
  "This is the president from the FBI Agents Association releasing this.",
  "People should not be drawing lines or implicating independent issues.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: Listen, I wrote a whole article about this.",
  "What they're trying to do is side track us with some political game.",
  "[14:30:00] BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN HOST: We now have a new statement in.",
  "BALDWIN: Let's talk about the House Intelligence Committee, Amanda.",
  "It is our job to make sure that the process is followed properly.",
  "What concerns me is if we are violating American civil liberties.",
  "Now that grave concern in government is a pretty specific phrase.",
  "That is the most disingenuous piece of verbiage I've heard today.",
  "GRAFF: But from sort of what we have --\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Ascertained.",
  "And if it's not followed properly, then we need accountability.",
  "And how many more will he go after until he puts it to an end?",
  "You're either on the president's team or you're off the team.",
  "RYAN: What I'm trying to say is people should not draw lines.",
  "And then they voted on releasing the memo to the White House.",
  "Grave is often a term that deals with top-secret information.",
  "This is all obfuscation to keep the real issue at hand away.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Amanda Carpenter came to play today.",
  "If you're going to talk about it, let's see the whole thing.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.",

  "Let it go through until its end and let's find out.",
  "Brian, Amanda, Garrett, thank you all so very much.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Can you give me an example?",
  "This is simply, and nothing else, but a power play.",

  "This does not implicate the Mueller investigation.",
  "They do their job and they do their job very well.",
  "If you're on the team, he'll make excuses for you.",
  "CARPENTER: Why is everybody trusting Devin Nunes?",
  "A major development in this Russia investigation.",
