  "Following the attacks in Brussels the same tired old refrains are flying again: We need to focus on the role of religion in terrorism; we need to have an \"honest\" conversation about Islam; we need to stop being politically correct; we need to name the enemy; we need to support \"real\" reformers; we need to stop \"regressive\" liberals from \"suppressing\" this crucial debate by raising the canard of Islamophobia.",
  "It is not that they don't care about how the subject of Islam is discussed in the West; they would in fact fervently hope that it is broached with insensitivity so that they can continue to prey on Muslim populations by selling their story of Islam being under global assault and by continuing to present themselves as victims even as they continue to make thousands of Muslims the victims of their crimes.",
  "They have also spawned and support a small but very vocal group of \"Ex-Muslims\" and \"Progressive Muslims\" like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Tarek Fatah who say the same exact things but are courted even more by certain sections of liberal media due to their \"credential\" of being a present or former Muslim.",

  "Let's see about that political correctness and suppression of debate:\n\nFrank Gaffney -- former Assistant Secretary at the Pentagon who runs the Center for Security Policy -- was recently named by presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as a security advisor.",
  "Regarding those two: much as they are often criticized by the media for their openly anti-Muslim rhetoric, their blogs have followings in the hundreds of thousands and they have popularized outlandish notions like \"Creeping Shariah\" and \"Taqiyya\".",
  "This paved the way for successive Western governments, especially after the advent of democracy, to separate religion and government through a gradual legislative process that required successive leaders to stay loyal to the idea of secularism.",
  "Or how about Robert Spencer, darling of the Fox News Network who runs the popular website \"Jihadwatch\" and who is quoted almost every day by other prominent conservative commentators like Pamela Geller and Andrew Breitbart.",
  "It will not stop the world from continuing to support-in fact it will increase support- for the Kings and dictators whose jails and torture cells have cultivated the atrocity exhibition that is ISIS and Al-Qaeda.",
  "The sort of debate that would emerge if those who wish \"political correctness\" to cease on this issue succeeded would be exactly what ISIS needs, and already exploits, to complement its \"Us Vs Them\" narrative.",
  "Let me help these people along the way and summarize the ideas they are pushing for: The Muslim World must accept that there is something intrinsic to Islam that creates and perpetuates violence and terrorism.",
  "It will not stop the religiopolitical parties of the Muslim World who have pushed anti-women and anti-minority legislation while thwarting progressive legislation to keep their political role alive.",
  "When you start a debate about religion you invariably end up with two sides each trying to win the other over, never with two sides doing their best to find middle ground and reach a consensus.",
  "After all this is done, extremism will decline, ISIS and Al-Qaeda will stop recruiting, extremist interpretations of Islam will be defeated and we will all live happily every after.",
  "Regardless of the role of individuals, governments, and organizations in generating terrorism, there seems a pathological preoccupation with fitting religion in as the prime mover.",

  "New Atheist writers like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have kept themselves in the limelight for the past decade purely on the strength of their frequent diatribes against Islam.",
  "The answer to terrorism will not leap out at us from the pages of scripture; it will require the world putting aside petty politics and vested interest and working together.",
  "Political rights, women's rights and LGBT rights were also won through sustained legislative and civil campaigns, not through effecting a rejection of faith or scripture.",
  "It is high time to disembark from this ship of fools and tackle the people and policies that have directly contributed to this grotesque golden age of global terrorism.",
  "Here's the third and most important problem with this argument:\n\nAn unbridled dialogue about Islam and terrorism will not stop ISIS from continuing on the warpath.",
  "In that respect, they are even more ominous in the picture they paint of millions in the Muslim world praying and planning for violent Jihad and global domination.",
  "Well here's a news flash; the only debate that has been ubiquitous in mainstream and social media since September 11, 2001 has been specifically about religion.",
  "Here's the first problem with this line of thinking:\n\nThere is no historical precedent of the followers of a faith reforming by disavowing parts of their faith.",
  "It will not stop the misguided invasions by global powers that create the vacuum which gave extremism a grand arena in Afghanistan in 1979 and in Iraq in 2003.",
  "Support democratic forces without prejudice and support progressive Muslims without demanding that they reach your desired level of lacking religiosity first.",
  "The insistence of many people on turning the debate on terrorism into a debate on religion often seems like an intellectual version of this gruesome exercise.",
  "That Muslims must \"reform\" their faith by disavowing certain parts of their scriptures which they must accept are advocating violence and global domination.",
  "Or how about the two main Republican contenders for president or many prominent members of the Tea Party; is their conversation about Islam \"honest\" enough?",
  "According to Greek mythology, Procrustes was a bandit who invited unsuspecting victims to spend the night at his house only to rob and kill them.",
  "Geller has excellent financing and is courted not only by Fox News but by liberal talk shows like Bill Maher's extremely popular \"Real Time.\"",
  "Better still, they should treat religion as a badge of membership and not take it seriously because, you know, religion makes people stupid.",
  "Whether it is cable news or social media, not a day goes by without a mention of the relationship between Islam and terrorism.",
  "Here's the second problem with the argument:\n\nISIS and Al-Qaeda have already made religion the centerpiece of their narrative.",
  "In short, none of what births and sustains violent extremism will be affected by this \"honest debate\" many want about Islam.",
  "Gaffney has frequented conservative media since 2003 and now has a potential path to the corridors of the White House.",
  "Reform is a gradual process that takes place on many fronts and cannot be forced or accelerated by outside forces.",
  "He was also cited by Donald Trump in his recent tweet about stopping Muslim immigration to the United States.",
  "It will not stop the proxy sectarian wars that Saudi Arabia and Iran are motivating from Karachi to Beirut.",
  "In fact these movements left religion largely untouched which may be part of the reason for their success.",
  "Many, including presidential candidates are already making irresponsible statements and fanning hatred.",
  "The Lutherans for example, broke the monopoly of the Catholic Church and weakened its political power.",
  "There is a legion of people who have dedicated their entire careers to the threats of \"Radical Islam.\"",
  "Societies have reformed by movements within religion paralleled by political and social movements .",
  "Sanction and lobby Saudi Arabia and Iran till they agree to sit at a table and talk like grown-ups.",
