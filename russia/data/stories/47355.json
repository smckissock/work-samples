  "It is against our policies for developers to share data without people’s consent, so we immediately banned Kogan’s app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and other entities he gave the data to, including Cambridge Analytica, formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data — which they ultimately did.",
  "We will\n\ncontinue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference, and we will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.",
  "You should be able to\n\nsign into apps and share your public information easily, but anything that\n\nmight also share other people’s information — like other posts in groups\n\nyou’re in or other people going to events you’re going to — will be much\n\nmore restricted.",
  "But while our primary focus was on traditional threats, we also saw some new behavior in the\n\nsummer of 2016 when APT28-related accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake\n\npersonas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists.",
  "What we found was that bad actors had used coordinated networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election: promoting or attacking specific candidates and causes, creating distrust in political institutions, or simply spreading confusion.",
  "INTRODUCTION\n\nChairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and Members of the Committee,\n\nWe face a number of important issues around privacy, safety, and democracy, and you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer.",

  "We also learned about a disinformation campaign run by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) —a Russian agency that has repeatedly acted deceptively and tried to manipulate people in the US, Europe, and Russia.",
  "- Last week, we took down more than 270 additional pages and accounts operated\n\nby the IRA and used to target people in Russia and Russian speakers in countries\n\nlike Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.",
  "We’re committed to getting this done in time for the\n\ncritical months before the 2018 elections in the U.S. as well as elections in\n\nMexico, Brazil, India, Pakistan and elsewhere in the next year.",
  "“It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent [Facebook’s] tools from being used for harm as well,” Mark Zuckerberg will say in his testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.",
  "Since 2016, we have improved our techniques\n\nto prevent nation states from interfering in foreign elections, and we’ve built more\n\nadvanced AI tools to remove fake accounts more generally.",
  "- We’re requiring developers to not only get approval but also to sign a\n\ncontract that imposes strict requirements in order to ask anyone for access\n\nto their posts or other private data.",
  "Over the same period, the IRA also spent approximately $100,000 on more than 3,000 ads on\n\nFacebook and Instagram, which were seen by an estimated 11 million people in the United\n\nStates.",
  "- We made some big changes to the Facebook platform in 2014 to dramatically\n\nrestrict the amount of data that developers can access and to proactively review\n\nthe apps on our platform.",
  "CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA\n\nOver the past few weeks, we’ve been working to understand exactly what happened with\n\nCambridge Analytica and taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.",
  "- In the U.S. Senate Alabama special election last year, we deployed new AI tools\n\nthat proactively detected and removed fake accounts from Macedonia trying to\n\nspread misinformation.",
  "As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have\n\ngotten a powerful new tool to stay connected to the people they love, make their voices heard, and build communities and businesses.",
  "It was installed by around 300,000 people who agreed to share some of their Facebook information as well as some information from their friends whose privacy settings allowed it.",
  "We’ve been working with other technology companies to share\n\ninformation about threats, and we’re also cooperating with the U.S. and foreign\n\ngovernments on election integrity.",
  "- I’ve directed our teams to invest so much in security — on top of the other\n\ninvestments we’re making — that it will significantly impact our profitability\n\ngoing forward.",
  "We know some Members of Congress are\n\nexploring ways to increase transparency around political or issue advertising, and we’re\n\nhappy to keep working with Congress on that.",
  "On Instagram, where our data on reach is not as complete, we found about 120,000 pieces of content, and estimate that an additional 20 million people were likely served it.",
  "We’re also working with the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office, which has jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica, as it completes its investigation into what happened.",
  "We took\n\nimportant actions to prevent this from happening again today four years ago, but we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.",
  "Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook Page associated with the IRA at some point during that period.",
  "This feature is useful in\n\ncases where people have the same name, but it was abused to link people’s\n\npublic Facebook information to a phone number they already had.",
  "- In Germany, before the 2017 elections, we worked directly with the election\n\ncommission to learn from them about the threats they saw and to share\n\ninformation.",
  "Your calendar should be able to show your friends’ birthdays, your maps should show where\n\nyour friends live, and your address book should show their pictures.",
  "We now serve\n\nmore than 2 billion people around the world, and every day, people use our services to stay\n\nconnected with the people that matter to them most.",
  "And when we address these challenges, I know we’ll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.",
  "What We Are Doing\n\nThere’s no question that we should have spotted Russian interference earlier, and we’re working hard to make sure it doesn’t happen again.",
  "We also required developers to get approval from Facebook before they could request any data beyond a user’s public profile, friend list, and email address.",
  "In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to\n\ndramatically limit the Facebook information apps could access.",
  "We need to make sure that developers like Kogan who got\n\naccess to a lot of information in the past can’t get access to as much information going\n\nforward.",
  "Last month, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified.",
  "This\n\nwill make it much harder for people to run pages using fake accounts, or to grow\n\nvirally and spread misinformation or divisive content that way.",
  "What Happened\n\nElections have always been especially sensitive times for our security team, and the 2016 U.S.\n\npresidential election was no exception.",
  "Most importantly, apps like\n\nKogan’s could no longer ask for information about a person’s friends unless their friends had\n\nalso authorized the app.",
  "I realize the issues we’re talking about today aren’t just issues for Facebook and our\n\ncommunity — they’re challenges for all of us as Americans.",
  "CONCLUSION\n\nMy top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community\n\nand bringing the world closer together.",
  "But\n\nthey will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the\n\n2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.",
  "So now we have to go through every part of our relationship with people and make sure we’re\n\ntaking a broad enough view of our responsibility.",
  "We’re in the process of investigating every app that had access\n\nto a large amount of information before we locked down our platform in 2014.",
  "Organizations\n\nlike the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we’ll keep improving our techniques to stay ahead.",
  "Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access some\n\ninformation about tens of millions of their friends.",
  "Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to investigate this.",
  "At the same time, it’s also important not to lose sight of the more straightforward and larger\n\nways Facebook plays a role in elections.",
  "And we organized “get out the vote” efforts that helped more than 2 million people register to vote who might not have voted otherwise.",
  "This included activity by a group called APT28, that the U.S. government has publicly linked to Russian military intelligence services.",
  "It’s not enough to give people control of their information, we have to make sure developers they’ve given it to are protecting it too.",
  "- But there’s more we can do here to limit the information developers can access\n\nand put more safeguards in place to prevent abuse.",
  "You can already\n\ndo this in your privacy settings, but we’re going to put it at the top of News Feed to make\n\nsure everyone sees it.",
  "We found about 470 accounts and pages linked to the IRA, which generated around 80,000 Facebook posts over about a two-year period.",
  "Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.",
  "It’s not enough to just give people a voice, we have to make sure people aren’t using it to hurt people or spread misinformation.",
  "What We Are Doing\n\nWe have a responsibility to make sure what happened with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica\n\ndoesn’t happen again.",
  "- For even greater political ads transparency, we have also built a tool that lets\n\nanyone see all of the ads a page is running.",
  "This week we started showing everyone a list of the apps\n\nyou’ve used and an easy way to revoke their permissions to your data.",
  "But I want to be clear about what our priority is: protecting our\n\ncommunity is more important than maximizing our profits.",
  "For example:\n\n- In France, leading up to the presidential election in 2017, we found and took\n\ndown 30,000 fake accounts.",
  "Election interference is\n\na problem that’s bigger than any one platform, and that’s why we support the\n\nHonest Ads Act.",
  "- Two weeks ago, we found out that a feature that lets you look someone up\n\nby their phone number and email was abused.",
  "In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as\n\ndevelopers and data privacy.",
  "RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nFacebook’s mission is about giving people a voice and bringing people closer together.",
  "In 2016, people had billions of interactions and open discussions on Facebook that may never\n\nhave happened offline.",
  "Just recently, we’ve seen the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in part, on Facebook.",
  "- We’re reducing the data you give an app when you approve it to only your\n\nname, profile photo, and email address.",
  "Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good.",
  "- In order to require verification for all of these pages and advertisers, we will hire\n\nthousands of more people.",
  "There have been a number of\n\nimportant elections since then where these new tools have been successfully deployed.",
  "Some of the pages we removed belong\n\nto Russian news organizations that we determined were controlled by the IRA.",
  "It will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I’m committed to getting it right.",
  "To do this, we enabled\n\npeople to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.",
  "Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars organizing and advertising online to get their messages out further.",
  "Our security team has been aware of traditional Russian cyber threats — like hacking and\n\nmalware — for years.",
  "Leading up to Election Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia.",
  "What Happened\n\nIn 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social.",
  "That includes improving the way we protect people’s information and safeguard elections around the world.",
  "And we’ll also keep building tools to help more people make their voices heard in the democratic process.",
  "These actions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from being able to access as much Facebook data today.",
  "- We have disabled thousands of accounts tied to organized, financially motivated\n\nfake news spammers.",
  "But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.",
  "We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we’re working hard to get\n\nbetter.",
  "And we also told everyone whose Facebook information may have\n\nbeen shared with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.",
  "From now on, every advertiser who wants to run political or issue ads will need to\n\nbe authorized.",
  "And if we find that someone is\n\nimproperly using data, we’ll ban them and tell everyone affected.",
  "Before I talk about the steps we’re taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here.",
  "In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app.",
  "These investigations have been used to improve our\n\nautomated systems that find fake accounts.",
  "Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that as long as I’m running Facebook.",
  "We’re starting this in the U.S. and expanding to the rest of\n\nthe world in the coming months.",
  "We’re removing developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their app in three months.",
  "Finally, we’re making it easier to understand which apps you’ve\n\nallowed to access your data.",
  "It’s not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure those connections are positive.",
  "Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.",
  "Any advertiser who doesn’t pass will be prohibited from running\n\npolitical or issue ads.",
  "For most of our existence, we focused on all\n\nthe good that connecting people can bring.",
  "After the election, we continued to investigate and learn more about these new threats.",
  "We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.",
  "And more than 70 million small businesses now use Facebook to grow and create jobs.",

  "If we\n\ndetect suspicious activity, we’ll do a full forensic audit.",
  "This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online.",
