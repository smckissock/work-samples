  "SHARE if you agree …’”\n\nMedia Matters for America said the tweet was shared by many people, including a co-anchor of Los Angeles TV station KTLA, Daily Beast correspondent Jamie Kirchick, FoxNews.com contributor Stephen L. Miller, New York Post writer Kirsten Fleming, a deputy director at the conservative think tank Hudson Institute and the chairman of Young Americans for Freedom.",
  "And even though there were plenty of tweets indicating that the quote was fake, other Twitter posts called Waters “unhinged” and an “imbecile.”\n\nA fake Maxine Waters quote about the Supreme Court is spreading on social media and radio.",
  "A Facebook account that supports President Donald Trump posted a doctored photo that appeared to show Waters on CNN and a banner that read:\n\n“Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant.”\n\nThe image made its way to Twitter.",
  "Waters has been at the center of controversy since she urged opponents of Trump’s immigration policies to confront Cabinet members and White House aides in public.",
  "She recently canceled some public appearances after receiving some death threats, but later said, “If you shoot me, you’d better shoot straight.",
  "A quote purportedly uttered by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has gained momentum on social media and radio ?",
  "There’s nothing like a wounded animal.”",
  "All of them later deleted their tweets.",
  "even though she never said the words."
