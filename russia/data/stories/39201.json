  "This directly contradicts Cohen’s January 11, 2017, appearance on Fox News Channel, where he told Sean Hannity, “The last time that there was any activity between the Trump Organization—actually, wasn’t even really the Trump Organization, it was the [2013] Miss Universe pageant, it was held in Moscow.”\n\nAbout his Russian interests, Trump held a calendar in one hand and crossed the fingers on his other when he deflected the Russia question in an interview with CBS4 Miami’s Jim Defede on July 27, 2016, saying, “I have nothing to do with Russia.”\n\nThe week also brought the back story from the New York Times of “Crossfire Hurricane,” the Rolling Stones-derived code name the FBI assigned to his original and wide-ranging investigation about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.",
  "The FBI so concealed the investigation from Congress and the press that when the Times attempted to measure its scope for a story on October 31, 2016, the government downplayed the probe, leading to the now-controversial headline, “Investigating Donald Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link to Russia.”\n\nParticipating in the fantastical-sounding operation along with the FBI, fleeting Trump attorney Joseph diGenova said Thursday night on Fox News, were senior members of the Department of Justice, former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey.",

  "Although our information about Mueller’s investigation is imperfect—he runs a ship of tight lips—he seems to have perfected the art of catching suspects who lie to investigators and then using that violation to get smaller fish like Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos and Alexander van der Zwaan (now in jail) to confess and cooperate.",
  "Presidential fixer Michael Cohen owes his suppurating wound (you know, the one he carries around the streets of Manhattan as he walks from cigar bar to cigar bar) to Mueller’s team, which uncovered that he accepted more than $1 million from an American company connected to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.",
  "In his testimony before the committee, Rob Goldstone—publicist and go-between for Aras Agalarov, a Russian oligarch, and his singer son Emin—said that Trump son-in-law Kushner got all “agitated” at the Trump Tower meeting when the Russians palavered on but didn’t spread any of the promised dirt.",

  "Donald Trump Jr.’s complete testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, all 249 pages of it released this week, stands as a study in obfuscation if not creative lying.",
  "He’s done Robert S. Mueller III much better, spraying him indirectly with a pair of “no collusion” tweets as the first anniversary of the special counsel’s appointment passed.",
  "McFarland’s nomination to the Singapore ambassadorship, zapping Sam Clovis’ appointment to the Department of Agriculture, and diluting Jared Kushner’s security clearance.",
  "DiGenova left his phaser set at “giggle” with his final words, saying \"criminal referrals have already been made\" and advising Brennan to get a good criminal attorney.",
  "Mueller didn’t give his anniversary partner anything in return, although a piece of paper—a subpoena to testify, perhaps—would have been in keeping with tradition.",
  "Asked, Junior said he couldn’t remember whether he had directed any of them to his father, even after a congressional investigator nudged him in that direction.",
  "The crazy thing about the diGenova-Giuliani reality duel is that the guy who isn’t Trump’s attorney is claiming to know more about the case than the guy who is.",

  "This week, for example, he persuaded the former son-in-law of the multiply-indicted Paul Manafort to cut a plea deal and cooperate in the investigation.",

  "Donald Trump proved himself a terrible gift-giver last month when all he got wife Melania for her 48th birthday was … a card.",
  "It will take some creative explaining—or a tidy lie—for Cohen to explain all the strange money flowing into his account.",
