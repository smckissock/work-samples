  "Facebook’s Immediate Crisis\n\nFor the past two weeks, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has been grappling with the backlash from lawmakers, regulators, users, and employees over Facebook’s mishandling of data following revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly obtained and misused data of 50 million Facebook users.",
  "As Peter Drucker noted in his landmark book, Strategy, and elsewhere, there are three broad responsibilities of management:\n\nassuring the performance of the institution for which managers work,\n\nmaking work productive and the worker achieving, and\n\nmanaging social impacts and social responsibilities.",
  "“The open nature of Facebook, coupled with the younger generation’s belief that ‘to be is to share,’ has resulted in a data set and targeting tools that make grocery store scanners, focus groups, panels, and surveys look like a cross between smoke signals and semaphore.",
  "That’s what makes the company so powerful—and potentially dangerous.” The question is whether Facebook will continue to be able to use that data as in the past, when Europe’s new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) comes into effect in May 2018.",
  "Celebrated, but just as important, is Facebook’s willingness to quickly back off when it gets pushback from users or the federal government.”\n\nWhile people use Facebook seemingly for free, the firm itself makes money from around five million advertisers.",
  "“Targeted advertising requires you to have a lot of accurate user information, but if you think about what happens after the implementation of GDPR, it will become much harder to hold that information,” said Neil Campling to the Financial Times.",
  "Facebook has assembled a large team to try to deal with the implementation of GDPR, but the research report suggests the new regulations will significantly impact the company’s ability to attract advertisers in the way it has done so far.",
  "According to a report cited by the Financial Times, many of Facebook’s current data collection policies will breach Europe’s stringent new privacy rules, threatening its ability to sell advertising based on targeted user information.",
  "Although Zuckerberg eventually apologized, he implied that this was a problem that had been fixed by changes in Facebook’s practices in 2014 and offered vague promises about improving Facebook’s use of users’ data in future.",
  "Facebook currently enables advertisers to discover small groups of people significantly more likely to be interested in their offerings through the use of demographic data and information about the pages a user has liked.",
  "But the amount of data collecting is mind-blowing, as Brandon Jones reports in his article, “What Information Does Facebook Collect About Its Users?”\n\nReining in Facebook isn’t likely to be a consumer-led revolution.",
  "Powered by its mobile app, Facebook is now the world’s biggest seller of display advertising—an amazing achievement, given Google’s success in taking ad revenues from traditional media only a few years ago.",
  "In September 2017, Spain’s data protection authority fined Facebook €1.2m for “collecting, storing and using data, including specially protected data, for advertising purposes without obtaining consent”.",
  "This sounds reasonable until you consider that the term platform was never meant to absolve companies from taking responsibility for the damage they do.”\n\nYet will Facebook be able to continue as before?",
  "Customers, thus far at least, have acted as though the utility of connecting with their friends on Facebook is so great that they are willing to endure substantial risks to their data and privacy.",

  "Even before this latest scandal, Facebook had already been facing months of scrutiny over how the social network was used by Russian agents to influence the 2016 presidential election.",
  "Facebook’s management claims ignorance as to how its algorithms reinforce polarization in our society, even as they divide the world into us vs. them and spike anger and outrage.",
  "That’s a lot of work, and it dents profits.”\n\nIt seems likely that Facebook will try to finesse the requirements of GPDR as before, given its culture of non-responsibility.",
  "Facebook often claims that it’s not using the data to tailor ads, but to better serve up content you may be interested in, or want to share, based on what you are doing.",
  "Anything you do involving Facebook is likely to be gathered and stored.”\n\n“Ironically,” says Galloway, “Facebook—and its advertisers—know more about us than our friends.",
  "Yet in the last two months, Facebook has lost over a $100 billion in market capitalization as Facebook’s business conduct has come under attack in both U.S. and Europe.",
  "Yet the fact that Facebook has been egregiously absent in terms of managing the social impacts and responsibilities of its business is now catching up with them.",
