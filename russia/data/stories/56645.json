  "Not even 15 minutes had passed since the Manafort news had been confirmed, and the three hosts had already found ways to bring the story back to Hillary Clinton; repeatedly imply that Manafort’s indictment had nothing whatsoever to do with his work on the Trump campaign; recite several Trump tweets verbatim without comment or analysis; play a video clip in which Kellyanne Conway cast aspersions on the press and Washington Democrats; reiterate there was “no evidence of collusion so far” between the Trump campaign and Russia; gratuitously insult Rep. Adam Schiff; suggest that the people who prematurely leaked the Manafort news to the media were the real crooks; and make it seem like Paul Manafort’s indictment was a welcome and necessary first step on the road to his eventual exoneration.",
  "And this is going to be a significant development if it is true, because it tells us where this investigation and this special counsel is headed.” After briefly establishing the facts, the Fox & Friends crew reverted to their standard roles as enthusiastic lickspittles for President Trump.",
  "So given the fact that Paul Manafort has dealt internationally for decades, probably a pretty good opportunity this was a while back.”\n\n“We interviewed Jonathan Turley, who’s a constitutional law professor, and he was talking about the leaking.",
  "As we mentioned even before the show started, and the big question we seemed to be zeroing in on, did this even happen, did any of this activity happen during his months with President Trump?” asked Kilmeade.",
  "Doocy then went on to revisit the Clinton campaign and the DNC’s role in helping to fund the Fusion GPS research, and to amplify President Trump’s choleric “DO SOMETHING” tweets from over the weekend.",
  "“Moments ago, there were reports coming out of multiple news organizations that it is going to be former campaign manager Paul Manafort and a business associate of his, Rick Gates,” Doocy continued.",
  "“The two of them set up a firm … Manafort’s firm set up in Cyprus to receive payments,” said Doocy, fumbling for the right words to use to properly exonerate the president.",
  "Or things he and Mr. Gates did years ago?”\n\n“Oh, I think this certainly suggests that they were looking into things they did years ago,” said Carter.",
  "The three hosts moved quickly to begin neutralizing any and all criticisms that might be lobbed Trump’s way as a result of the Manafort indictment.",
  "When Monday morning’s episode of Fox & Friends began at 6 a.m., hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade were focused on one thing.",
  "Carter has been a ubiquitous face on Fox News recently, ever since she and John Solomon of the Hill revived the long-dormant Uranium One story.",
  "“Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups is the most popular Halloween candy, according to a survey,” said Kilmeade during a “News by the Numbers” segment.",
  "“I mean, we’ve heard about Ukraine, and we’ve heard about other business dealings in Eastern Europe, but we had not heard about Cyprus.",
  "“In addition to Mr. Manafort, apparently, Sara, Rick Gates, a former business associate, told to surrender today,” said Doocy.",
  "“There is speculation mounting as we await the first indictment of the special counsel on Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.",
  "With that settled, Fox & Friends changed the topic to something more suitable for a light-hearted morning show: candy.",
  "“Does this suggest to you that they’re looking into things Manafort did when he was campaign manager?",
  "After going to a commercial break, the three hosts welcomed guest Sara Carter, a reporter for Circa.",
  "“It is an announcement that could be made today.”\n\nAround 8 a.m., the announcement finally broke.",
  "“Evidently the report goes on to say the FBI probe is looking into 13 suspicious wire transfers.",
  "“[Manafort] was under investigation for violations of federal tax law and money laundering.",
  "and then not disclosing his foreign transactions as a lobbyist,” said Earhardt.",
  "You stop being—now you can start defending yourself.”\n\nGood old Fox & Friends.",
  "Then you have a chance to find out what they have and to mount a defense.",
  "“Just because you’re indicted, doesn’t mean you’re guilty of anything.",
  "“That is not confirmed by us yet, but it is certainly out there.",
  "“Keep in mind, and I just keep saying this,” said Kilmeade.",
  "The leaker could also be in trouble here,” said Earhardt.",
  "“Reese’s miniatures and Twix rounding out the top three.”",
  "“We finally have a name.”\n\nTwo names, actually.",
  "We’ve got a Fox News alert,” said Steve Doocy.",
  "“Today, not tonight,” emphasized Earhardt.",
  "(Don’t worry, he eventually found them!)",
  "We expect it today,” said Kilmeade.",
  "“All right.",
  "Great!"
