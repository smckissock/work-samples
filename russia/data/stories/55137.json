  "The media was mostly benign, and didn’t play a destructive role.” Referring to some of the AfD’s more extremist positions and remarks, Wientzek added: “There is also a strong consensus in Germany on ‘you don’t do that.’” But on one point Wientzek is convinced: “Emulation is almost always the worst strategy.” As one official told BuzzFeed News, “Populism thrives not because of the Le Pens and the Wilders, but because of the failures of centrists like David Cameron.”\n\nIt is difficult to talk about right-wing populism in Germany without references to the country’s past: The lessons of World War II, the Cold War, and the trauma of the Berlin Wall all make their way into conversations.",
  "“The refugee crisis, but particularly New Year's Eve in Cologne 2015, have actually helped create a more controversial but also a more honest climate.” Parts of German media were highly vocal during the financial crisis, some even calling for Greece to leave the euro; others are sceptical of EU rules (at times, much like the UK press) and a number were strongly critical of Merkel’s handling of the refugee crisis.",
  "Alongside spending tens of billions of euros on housing and integrating refugees, the government has been a key advocate of a controversial and much criticised agreement between the EU and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants reaching Greece, and is pushing for similar arrangements with other countries (alongside development and cooperation efforts).",

  "According to Olaf Wientzek of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank close to Merkel’s CDU, there is no clear single recipe for challenging right-wing populism: “In some cases including populists in government has seen their support fall [in Finland, for example].",
  "But the far-right party’s slide is the result of an extraordinarily focused effort from both media and the government to defeat the far right through controlling the language of immigration discourse as well as a raft of expensive policies.",
  "Still, the vast majority of Germany’s political mainstream and the country’s media have always been careful to not conflate refugees with economic migrants, and – in contrast to the UK – trust in the press among Germans remains high.",

  "The right wing of the CDU, and its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), were clamouring for the introduction of a cap on new arrivals.",
  "The thinking in her inner circle was that a cap would make the immigration debate about numbers, not substance: Someone will always demand a lower cap.",
