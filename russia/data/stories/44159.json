  "Silicon Valley insider on why you should take a social media break right now 12:01 PM ET Thu, 21 June 2018 | 05:19\n\nRather than resisting data collection, society should double down on it â€” so long as people are appropriately compensated, technology pioneer Jaron Lanier argued.",
  "Amid several cases of high profile breaches and data mismanagement, consumers are increasingly aware of just how much information big technology companies collect from users.",
  "But Lanier, an interdisciplinary scientist at Microsoft and vocal critic of social media, says rather than locking up data, people should be incentivized to give it away.",
  "It all came to a head in March, after reports that Cambridge Analytica, hired by Donald Trump's campaign, improperly used data of 87 million Facebook users.",
  "Lanier also argued that data will become even more important as artificial intelligence technology advances, because \"AI needs your data.\"",
  "Growing fears of unchecked data use have prompted behavioral and policy changes, like Europe's General Data Protection Rule.",
  "Instead of taking it, we should tell people, 'You're valuable in this new way,'\" Lanier said on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\"",
  "Let's admit that data is valuable, pay people for it, motivate them to make it better.",
  "\"The reason companies need your data is they want to be AI companies,\" Lanier said.",
  "Taking data and using it to manipulate people is not a real market.",
  "\"We should think about data as a new way that people provide value.",
  "Let's get out of the manipulation business,\" Lanier said.",
  "\"I believe in markets."
