  "“While they continued to hold open the door to a diplomatic resolution of this crisis, based on the Geneva agreement, the five leaders agreed that in the light of Russia’s refusal to support the process, an extension of the current targeted sanctions would need to be implemented, in conjunction with other G7 leaders and with European partners,” a spokesperson for Cameron’s office said.",

  "On Friday, Kerry warned that new round of American financial assaults on Russia were on the way.",
  "Other top U.S. officials are also now out of direct contact with their Russian interlocutors.",
  "Russian businesses and individuals close to Putin would be on the sanctions list, he added.",
  "Asked during his stop in South Korea if he would save Putin from drowning, Obama said.",
