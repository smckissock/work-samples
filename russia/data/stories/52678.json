  "As I have written on numerous occasions, WikiLeaks was a godsend for Putin to “show corruption in American politics.” The Kremlin media has regaled the Russian public with the US press’s own accounts of a rigged election, conspiracies against Bernie Sanders, of Soros, Goldman Sachs, and the Saudi princes determining the election outcome, the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and the press, and the Clintons growing rich from their political connections.",
  "But neither of the sources said they knew of specific intelligence that directly ties Putin to the attack.”\n\nThe likely result of a serious investigation would be a strong suspicion that Putin ordered the hacks because such operations “require high-level approval.” The Kremlin will continue to invoke “plausible deniability,” and we may have to increasingly take action in the absence of certainty of guilt.",
  "The London judge in the Litvinenko polonium poisoning could only conclude that Putin was a “likely” defendant because a murder in a foreign country would have to be approved “at the highest levels.”\n\nObama invoked the same logic in justifying new sanctions for Russian hacking: \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin….",
  "Could this, as cautioned by Rolling Stone’s “Something About This Russian Story Stinks,” turn out to be a historic intelligence failure: “The problem with this story is that, like the Iraq-WMD mess, it takes place in the middle of a highly politicized environment during which the motives of all the relevant actors are suspect.",
  "A cooperative media has concluded, as the New York Times put it, that “Russian hacking was meant to help elect Mr. Trump.” The political establishment has thus concluded that the Russian state hacked the emails to elect Trump, who will cancel sanctions, weaken NATO, and betray Ukraine.",
  "WikiLeaks’s release of thousands of damaging DNC, Podesta, and other private accounts starting in June left Hillary with the weak defense that “the Russians did it; pay no attention.”\n\nWith the shocking election of Trump, some Democrats now blame Russian intervention for the upset.",
  "According to the released FBI-DHS Grizzly Steppe report “two different RIS [Russian Intelligence Service] actors participated in the intrusion into a U.S. political party.” They used simple spearphishing and then extracted material with a high level of sophistication.",
  "Trump’s election spoils Putin’s narrative\n\nRussian propagandists, fully expecting a Clinton victory, played up Trump as the Don Quixote candidate – a shining knight fighting against all odds -- about to be rolled over by the crooked American political establishment.",
  "He can use his propaganda to turn Trump into a monster on par with George Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton or he can use the brief window of a positive US presidential figure to explore whether there are real opportunities to repair US-Russian relations.",
  "He maintains that “the complexity of modern hackers made it ‘extremely difficult’ to definitively say who was responsible for the leak, and suggested that they can disguise their activities and ‘leave their mark,’ or even the mark of others.\"",
  "Some bloggers used treason to characterize President-elect Donald Trump’s praise of Putin as “smart” for not letting Obama’s last-minute sanctions obstruct negotiations over the “unsatisfactory state of relations” between Russia and America.",
  "As outgoing President Barack Obama imposed additional (largely symbolic) sanctions on Russia and the Senate scheduled hearings on Russian interference in the US elections, Vladimir Putin decided not to respond with counter sanctions.",
  "Unfortunately, politicians on both sides of the aisle seem intent on turning such an investigation into a political football from which we learn nothing, while Putin's nuclear saber rattling makes such a study even more urgent.",
  "Another hacker (or hacking organization), calling itself Guccifer 2, with suspected ties to Russian intelligence, claimed that it hacked the DNC and Clinton Foundation and turned the material over to WikiLeaks.",
  "Trump’s unexpected 2016 election was a monumental intelligence/media/political failure that deserves serious non-partisan investigation of the following open questions:\n\nDid Putin order the hacks?",
  "The WikiLeaks release of Clinton-camp emails has readied an indifferent America for a serious discussion of the worldwide threat of Russian aggression through both soft and hard power.",
  "Watch On Forbes: Don't Presume That Tillerson Will Be Soft On Russia\n\nUntil 2016, US politics, with its two major parties and billion dollar elections, seemed impenetrable.",
  "Trump campaign officials, who had consulted for Russian-friendly clients, were forced to withdraw, while Clinton’s top campaign officials with similar ties were left alone.",
  "The use by Russian media of WikiLeaks for domestic consumption makes a very strong case that Putin wanted the hacked emails to bolster his tenuous hold on domestic power.",
  "They were hacking, but the use they allegedly made of this hacking eludes me.” The answer to Kissinger’s question: The hacking was meant for a domestic audience.",
  "This is contrary to Putin’s narrative of a decadent, greedy, and aggressive US establishment that uses its political monopoly to cut down a Trump-like candidacy.",
  "A CNN assessment, based on intelligence leaks, claims that “the use of the advanced tools suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved in the hacks….",
  "The US intelligence community, according to leaks, appears convinced that Russian governmental agencies are behind the hacks because of their sophistication.",
  "As noted by none other than Henry Kissinger, Putin, like everyone else, would have expected a Clinton victory, perhaps even a landslide, based on the polls.",
  "Russia’s information technologists target external enemies -- NATO and EU countries-- through disinformation and assistance to Russian-friendly parties.",
  "The Anna Politovskaya and Boris Nemtsov murders involved complicated layers of sub-contractors, hired killers, Chechen clans, and Russian underworld.",
  "The 2016 election shows Russians that, in America, a candidate can come out of nowhere – a David to slay the Goliath of crooked American politics.",
  "A victorious Clinton would offer Putin hostile predictability, but her base would restrain her from an aggressive military and foreign policy.",
  "The unanticipated consequence of his surprise victory, therefore, is an unwelcome affirmation of American democracy for the Russian people.",
  "To be true, reports of “incontrovertible evidence” that Putin wanted Trump elected require that our spies know Putin’s innermost thoughts.",
  "Few took notice of RT’s 2013 revelation of Clinton’s private email account that reinforced her reputation for dishonesty two years later.",
  "The Kremlin’s foreign media arms, RT and Sputnik, attracted small US audiences, and only fringe parties heeded the Kremlin’s siren call.",
  "This is the last message Putin wants delivered to the Russian people with his own carefully-orchestrated election scheduled for 2018.",
  "Even worse for Putin, Trump would promote US energy development and drive down the energy prices on which Putin’s Petrostate rests.",
  "The main target is the Russian people, who must be convinced that Russia is under imminent threat from the decadent hegemonic West.",
  "In past “black “operations, Putin has maintained space between himself and the actual perpetrators to disguise his involvement.",
  "Trump would be unpredictable, would build up US armed forces, and have to make strong deals to meet his electoral promises.",
  "For Putin “to antagonize the president-to-be by getting into an open support of the opponent doesn’t make any sense to me.",
  "Another unanswered question, therefore, is why such sophisticated hackers left traces to identify them almost immediately?",
  "We need more detailed intelligence reports to determine whether multiple cyber-attackers are claiming the same hack.",
  "Crowdstrike promptly assigned blame to two cyber organizations purportedly associated with Russian intelligence.",

  "Despite these facts, Russia played a major role from the start to finish of the 2016 campaign.",
  "Putin could now ask: Who gives these Clintons the right to criticize me and my elections?",
  "Per this line of thinking, Russia’s intervention thus invalidates Trump’s presidency.",

  "this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government.\"",
  "Ordinary Russians used the occasion to take a drunken holiday.",
  "What more revenge against Hillary Clinton could Putin ask for?",
