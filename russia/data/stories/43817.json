  "\"The Board has announced today that Dr. Alexander Tayler has stepped down as acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica and will resume his former position as Chief Data Officer in order to focus on the various technical investigations and inquiries,\" Cambridge Analytica said in its statement.",
  "Wednesday's announcement comes after Cambridge Analytica suspended its previous CEO, Alexander Nix, on March 20, naming Tayler as acting CEO, amid public revelations that the analysis firm had improperly obtained the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users.",
  "Tayler's resignation also came the same morning Facebook cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his second appearance before Congress to testify about the social media company's practices around privacy, content moderation, hate speech and Russian election meddling.",
  "The political research firm that has come under scrutiny for improperly acquiring the personal information of 87 million Facebook users announced on Wednesday that its acting CEO Alexander Tayler has stepped down.",
  "The firm, London-based Cambridge Analytica, said in a statement on its website that Tayler has resigned from his chief executive position and will return to his previous role as chief data officer.",
  "Cambridge Analytica purchased the data from a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan, who collected the data through an app he developed and connected to Facebook in 2013.",
  "In 2014, Facebook changed its policies to stop allowing app creators to access data about a person's friends unless the user's friends had also authorized the app.",
  "Facebook learned last month that Cambridge Analytica \"may not\" have deleted the data as it had claimed and banned the firm from using any of its services.",
  "In 2015, Facebook learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had violated Facebook's policies by sharing the data with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Cambridge Analytica is being investigated by U.K. authorities, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook's privacy practices.",
  "Facebook then banned Kogan from the platform and demanded that he and Cambridge Analytica \"formally certify\" that they had deleted the data.",
  "\"We would like to thank Dr. Tayler for his service in what has been a challenging time for the company.\"",
  "The data analysis firm helped run President Donald Trump's political campaign."
