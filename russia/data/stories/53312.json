  "(Photo: Julie Jacobson, AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — A painting of Christ by the Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci sold for a record $450 million (380 million euros) at auction on Wednesday, obliterating previous records for artworks sold at auction or privately.",
  "The highest known sale price for any artwork had been $300 million (253 million euros), for Willem de Kooning's \"Interchange,\" sold privately in September 2015 by the David Geffen Foundation to hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin.",
  "The 26-inch-tall (66-centimeter-tall) Leonardo painting dates from around 1500 and shows Christ dressed in Renaissance-style robes, his right hand raised in blessing as his left hand holds a crystal sphere.",
  "The painting was sold Wednesday by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million (108 million euros) in a private sale that became the subject of a continuing lawsuit.",
  "Christie's says most scholars agree that the painting is by Leonardo, though some critics have questioned the attribution and some say the extensive restoration muddies the work's authorship.",
  "Christie's capitalized on the public's interest in Leonardo, considered one of the greatest artists of all time, with a media campaign that labeled the painting \"The Last Da Vinci.\"",

  "The painting was sold again in 1958 and then acquired in 2005, badly damaged and partly painted-over, by a consortium of art dealers who paid less than $10,000 (8,445 euros).",
  "The painting, called \"Salvator Mundi,\" Italian for \"Savior of the World,\" is one of fewer than 20 paintings by Leonardo known to exist and the only one in private hands.",
  "In New York, where no museum owns a Leonardo, art lovers lined up outside Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters on Tuesday to view \"Salvator Mundi.\"",
  "Once owned by King Charles I of England, it disappeared from view until 1900, when it resurfaced and was acquired by a British collector.",
