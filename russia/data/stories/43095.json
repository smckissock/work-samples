  "Carrey, the actor and comedian who has recently made a name for himself as a political artist, posted a new drawing on Twitter on Tuesday showing Hannity and Jones as WWE wrestlers sparring in the ring in front of a crowd of onlookers that includes Hitler.",
  "Getty Images / Mario Tama\n\nJim Carrey's latest drawing goes after the Fox News host Sean Hannity and the InfoWars host Alex Jones, depicting them as professional wrestlers and criticizing them for doing \"damage to the culture.\"",
  "Carrey received backlash from Fox News and conservative commentators last month after posting an unflattering portrait of the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.",
  "Carrey has taken that line of criticism to a new level, grouping Sinclair with Hannity and Jones, who is best known for pushing conspiracy theories on his InfoWars show.",
  "In July, the \"Last Week Tonight\" host John Oliver criticized its right-leaning \"must run\" segments, and on Sunday, he blasted the company over the \"false news\" script.",
  "A Deadspin video went viral this week showing anchors at local TV news stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group reciting the same speech about \"false news.\"",
  "The tweet says: \"If u believe wrestling is real u may even believe Fox news, Info Wars and the robotic drones on Sinclair Broadcasting.",
