  "But in filing in one of the cooperating witness' cases, the lawyer for a major law firm who prepared a report and lied about it to the FBI relating to Manafort's business for Ukraine, you had the filing that Richard Gates, the deputy to Manafort, was in touch throughout the campaign, including the closing weeks of the campaign, September -- October '16, to a guy who was a known Russian intelligence agent, a guy from the GRU.",
  "So, let's talk about this new fight he's picking with Amazon and the rest of the week's developments with Jill Colvin, a White House reporter for \"The Associated Press\", and Michael Isikoff, chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News and the author of the number one best-selling book in the country, \"Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump\".",
  "And I think the conclusion was, kind of the consensus is, this is an attempt to soften the ground, to discredit Bob Mueller and his people and the men and women of the FBI, so that if something does come down the line and show some kind of malfeasance, that they can look back and say, aha, we told you all along that these folks can't be trusted.",
  "So, I think that this -- you know, these '90s and aughts radio host folks who have become faces of Fox News are realizing that acting like wrestling heels and saying whatever you want is unfortunately not the way it works, and that meeting speech with speech is fine, but part of speech in our culture is money.",
  "I fault those who masquerade as journalists, who -- and, fortunately, I can't sympathize with this -- to go to bed every night looking back knowing that your spent your day as a shill for a politician, and knowing you're going to get up tomorrow and do the same, it's got to be an incredibly icky feeling.",
  "Journalism -- I agree, journalism essentially has the same root as activism, where, when you're going into covering a story, you want to present people with all of the facts and all of the information, hoping that they will be able to be informed enough and go out and make what change they feel is best.",
  "STELTER: Do you see the ultimate strategy here, the daily complaints and attacks against the FBI, as a plan for whatever happens down the line with Mueller, whatever indictments come, that Trump and his media allies will be able to point and say, they're biased, they're corrupt, you can't believe it?",
  "And then we're talking about the ongoing attacks against Robert Mueller's investigation, attacks coming from the right against the FBI, attacks like this one:\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEAN HANNITY, HOST, \"HANNITY\": Our sources are telling us that the abusive power is far bigger than Watergate.",
  "And, you know, my first concern was when they hired Boris Epshteyn from the Trump White House and made him the chief political analyst, and stations were dictated to carry his, what I think of as, talking points, almost out of the Trump's -- talking points almost, out of the Trump White House.",
  "There's so much history involved in this, if you try to put it in context, put it in context of \"All in the Family\" as a working-class, highly political sitcom from '71 to '79 with a president, Richard Nixon, like Trump in the White House, and the same kind of cultural divide we have today.",
  "And a lot of these -- if you think about law enforcement, which is mostly right-of-center, a lot of folks, politically, they would sit say perplexed and say, here's the network that we watch, here's the party -- quote, unquote -- \"of law enforcement\" that's now attacking the FBI.",
  "When you look at politics -- and this is what I'm afraid, when you look at this prime-time lineup, when you have the political model that's now infused on top of journalism, these folks start with a conclusion and then selectively pick facts in order to reach that conclusion.",
  "But now that the show is a hit, now that people are looking forward to the next episode, there's also talk about Roseanne Barr's real life views, about what she's been tweeting about, about what she's been saying online, because she's been into conspiracy theories for years.",
  "And she -- also, I think the show represents something that was more important, especially in the first run, which was putting out a point of view in this country that was the last time we really saw true working-class views represented on television in a mainstream way.",
  "TAGOURI: Well, I think that saying that journalism and activism should not touch at all or not be related at all is a very privileged mentality, because, essentially, choosing what stories we're going to cover and how we're going to cover them is a form of activism.",
  "STELTER: Michael, I've noticed every time Mueller fades from the headlines for a week or there aren't new indictments for a couple weeks, there's a conservative media narrative that, ah, Mueller doesn't have anything and the media has moved on from collusion.",
  "I think Roseanne is an important figure in the history of American television because she brought working-class sitcom back to the top 10, and she did it in the '80s, you know, in the era of \"Dynasty\" and \"Dallas\" and glitz and money, much like today.",
  "And I think, at the end of the day, because the FBI is an organization that has to be believed, if this corrosive doubt continues to take hold and the American people really think the FBI can't be trusted, then I think it's dangerous for our country.",
  "It was this comment from Rebecca Schneid:\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREBECCA SCHNEID, STUDENT, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: I think that, for me, the purpose of journalism is to raise the voices of people that maybe don't have a voice.",
  "I mean, we've seen countless examples of where some random account on Fox News, Saturday night Jeanine Pirro show, or Sean Hannity, which has only a marginal connection with reality then gets echoed and amplified by the president on Twitter.",
  "Look, this thing by Deadspin is a really clever piece of editing, but it powerfully states what people have been saying about the danger of centralized messaging if a broadcaster decides it wants to send out political messages that way.",
  "You take a look at her Twitter feed, her social media feeds, you will see it for herself, some fringe conspiracy theories that she's been embracing, including one about something called QAnon, a conspiracy theory called The Storm.",
  "If you are centralizing a political message to however many -- more than 200 stations I think it'll be if they get the FCC approval for this, to 200 stations, you have one of the great political messaging machines in the world.",
  "But you have to believe that the president's tweets clearly complicated his job and made it much more difficult to deal with all the issues that -- and, you know, remember, the president has a depleted legal team right now.",
  "Look, on the Amazon issue, there may well be legitimate issues to debate about what the pricing policy should be for Amazon's shipment, its impact on retail stores or whether it's paying its full fair share of sales taxes.",
  "COLVIN: Problem is, when those kinds of errors then trickle in to\n\n\n\nthese are official communications from the president, these are official communications from the United States, what does that do to U.S. credibility?",
  "This is a president who very often will overlook those truths and those facts to make a political point, or in this case to be able to continue ramming \"The Washington Post\" because he's angry at stories he's written.",
  "All these are legitimate questions, but when it comes off as Trump's going after Jeff Bezos because he doesn't like what \"The Washington Post\" is writing about him, it undermines whatever he's trying to accomplish.",
  "And I think the other thing that's really dangerous, in my view, is also this echo chamber of -- especially in the right wing and sometimes in the left of saying really egregious things simply to get attention.",
  "And there's been talk about this being a Trump effect, that Barr's support in real life and on the show for President Trump was a big factor, although I think it had a lot to do with the comedy of the show.",
  "And I do think it's interesting to have a show on the air that shows right and left in a house, which is what's happening in America and probably around the Easter table and the Passover tables right now.",
  "And now even high school kids are becoming the attack -- the victims of, you know, people on media who say, OK, we're throwing everything, all caution to the wind and now we're setting our sights on them.",
  "But the fact that the president himself was attacking on Twitter the deputy director of the FBI raised questions about whether the decision to fire him was done for a legitimate reason, based on the I.G.",
  "Could you imagine going through something like that and having the ability to speak on the Washington mall and activate yourself while pushing into the back of your mind what you have suffered through?",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSTELTER: So you're saying that there are folks still at the FBI that have to explain this to their relatives, right, that have to say, here's why they're attacking us on television?",
  "CAMPBELL: I don't fault a politician for looking and saying, OK, here's my orbit, and communication is a part of that, so I'm going to try to co-opt fringe media in order to help amplify my view.",
  "I see it as a piece of his directives to the Justice Department about who they should investigate, his attacks on Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director who was fired at the Justice Department.",
  "Whether you're an FBI agent or analyst at FBI headquarters, maybe you're down in Salt Lake doing an investigation, moving up in the chain, or you're out in the field, you are impacted by this.",
  "And when you are making those decisions on what people are going to consume, that, in itself, is a form of activism, because you are deciding what is important enough for people to hear.",
  "So, any step similarly with Jeff Bezos and Amazon, any step the board of governors of the Postal Service or Congress seeks to -- does in response, will have the same cloud cast over it.",
  "Are they doing it because of legitimate policy reasons the president is making, or is it because he's going after a political enemy and they're bowing to pressure from the White House?",
  "So, if you feel you're a high school student and somebody of her stature is taunting you on Twitter -- look, there's two things about these students at Parkland that just fascinate me.",
  "And especially, it's the local people, the people you see at the supermarket in Tulsa, Oklahoma, or your hometown in Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, who are delivering these messages.",
  "But, I mean, this is not the kind of legal fire power you would want when you're up against a major criminal investigation into your campaign and the operations of your White House.",
  "You know, Amazon not only do the packages mailed by the USPS cover the cost, but Amazon and all the money it spends with the postal service is helping keep the postal service alive.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'll be off next week for Easter break with my kids, but fear not, we've got a great lineup of guest hosts to fill in for me.",
  "And when you're in a newsroom, oftentimes, the people who are running the show typically tend to be people of privilege, whether they're white college-educated men and so forth.",
  "So everybody all of a sudden started to live in suburban homes and the mothers wore pearls while they were doing the dishes and the dads always had a white shirt and tie on.",
  "We're choosing what's going to be prioritized in the media, what is going to be covered, how much we're going to cover it, how much we're going to go into the story itself.",
  "And, you know, the problem is that it undermines whatever legitimate policy goals the president might have in mind because it comes off as him just attacking his enemies.",
  "And yet, in the case of Roseanne Barr, I wonder if people should try to separate or maybe in all cases try to separate their personal views from their professional work.",
  "And I think the most amazing thing to me is these young kids have more maturity and purpose than most of the folks who are trying to cover the story, especially at Fox.",
  "ATAMANUIK: I think it's one of the more difficult ones, because she has tweeted some things I think people would consider beyond the pale, Pizzagate being one of them.",
  "I think when you look back at that show, you say, yes, you know, it is good that we can sort of symbolically have these discussions about politics in a sitcom format.",
  "To put this into perspective for you, my sources at ABC said the show was more than twice as highly rated as the network projected, as the network expected it to be.",
  "Let's put on screen some of the other examples of President Trump, using his power of the office to pressure companies or criticize companies that he's at odds with.",
  "This week, the narrative was, ah, the media is focusing on Stormy Daniels because that's a new way to get to the president because Mueller hasn't found collusion.",

  "They quickly got away from it because Madison Avenue wanted to use television to sell the consumer society of credit cards and buying on credit to America.",
  "And they have it because of what they went through, seeing classmates killed and then having to mourn and bury their classmates and go on with their life.",
  "I'm Brian Stelter, and this is RELIABLE SOURCES, our weekly look at the story behind the story, of how the media really works and how the news gets made.",
  "We see again and again where the president puts out tweets that contain -- I think there was one recently that had like five errors in 140 characters.",
  "[11:55:02]\n\n\n\nSTELTER: And I look at something like the March For Our Lives last weekend, and I say, journalists have to stay on the sidelines, right?",
  "And if you think about it, there were some out there who were saying, well, we're just talking about leadership, we're not talking about the people.",
  "He will let, for instance, Dan Scavino, his social media guy, who is at this point pretty much his longest serving aide, someone he's very close to.",
  "ISIKOFF: Well, you know, I think to those of us who are following the Mueller investigation closely, it was highly significant and got duly noted.",
  "Josh, you posted a tweet this week that caught my eye, saying that\n\n\n\nHannity's attacks, the complaints from FOX, they are warping people's minds.",
  "Anthony, what I oftentimes hear from conservative media is that liberal celebrities, they should stay out of politics and not talk about politics.",
  "I mean, I think one of the big issues here is that Laura Ingraham was not in some sort of capacity as a radio host or TV show host in that moment.",
  "He said: The president often gets agitated and stirred to action by random things he hears on TV or from shoot the bull conversations of friends.",
  "I think the fact these students are under attack in the first place, though, proves they're winning, proves how much political power they have.",
  "You know, we have yet to hear from John Dowd about all the reasons that he was the president's top lawyer who resigned just a week or so ago.",
  "STELTER: Yes, I was just pulling up this quote from \"Axios\" this week that I wanted to read to you, Michael, and see if it rings true to you.",
  "STELTER: Time Warner is in the process of being bought by AT&T, but the Justice Department under President Trump is suing to block the deal.",
  "If you want to affect the way or have repercussions for how you speak out against somebody, then a good way is to remove their advertisers.",
  "So, why you would go after someone like that and not expect the fiercest kind of push back that he or she can generate doesn't make sense.",
  "If the president is saying something, you don't put it out there for readers without the context of explaining whether it's true or not.",
  "And it dawned on me that these are two professions that are very similar, in the sense that you collect facts and then you explain them.",
  "Now, news outlets have been churning out fact check after fact check, correcting the false claims here and trying to put it in context.",
  "Laura Ingraham picked on Parkland-shooting-survivor- turned-activist David Hogg, mocking him for getting rejected by several colleges.",
  "But I think if you tweet and you work in the mainstream media, you might as well publish it on the front page of \"The New York Times.\"",
  "But, again, Twitter has devolved 5,000 years of human history of trying to clear our mind of the first thought that comes to our head.",
  "The medium started out in the early '50s with a number of hard-core working-class sitcoms like \"The Honeymooners\" and \"The Goldbergs.\"",

  "Josh Kraushaar of \"The National Journal\" said, \"Journalism is not activism, and that mentality is killing trust in our profession.\"",
  "My focus here is on the prime-time lineup that often tries to masquerade itself as news, when, in fact, it's really entertainment.",
  "The president tends to lash out when \"The Post\" publishes a particular juicy story about palace intrigue as they did this weekend.",
  "So I think the idea of returning to a deeper debate and putting some issues out there that are uncomfortable for people are good.",
  "What I think is interesting, Jill, is that some of the president's attacks against companies or other figures, they're not true.",
  "It drives staff nuts because they're responding to things that are either inaccurate, highly distorted, or flat-out don't exist.",
  "And actually, on our podcast this week, our RELIABLE SOURCES podcast, we talk more in depth about sorting out fact and fiction.",
  "ZURAWIK: Totally, and --\n\n\n\nSTELTER: Anthony, let me get your take on this ad boycott issue because you work at Comedy Central.",
  "But it's notable because this time last year when Bill O'Reilly was in trouble, he went on vacation, too, and never came back.",
  "You know, he's down to like basically Jay Sekulow, an assistant at this point, as well as Ty Cobb from inside the White House.",
  "But that symbolic kind of playing out of the tensions that Roseanne and Laurie Metcalf have in this show I think is important.",
  "And when I talk about FOX, I just want to say at the outset that there are a lot of good, hardworking journalists over at FOX.",
  "And we now have this new evidence that he was communicating with a guy who the FBI believed was a Russian intelligence agent.",
  "Do you see a connection here between the Amazon attacks and some of the other companies he's been battling with as president?",
  "And instead now we celebrate all the flotsam and jetsam that shoots out of our prefrontal cortex, which is a bigger problem.",
  "The question all along has been whether President Trump's disdain for CNN is somehow a factor in the government's lawsuit.",
  "ATAMANUIK: Well, I think that David really has it right, which is that it also has to do with the position somebody's in.",
  "This weekend, he's attacking Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos in what appears to be a proxy war with \"The Washington Post.\"",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[11:53:18]\n\n\n\nSTELTER: There was a moment on last week's RELIABLE SOURCES that sparked a reaction.",

  "Now, we don't know the details yet of what those communications were, but that was a significant new filing by Mueller.",
  "It drove his lawyers crazy, because especially when it gets into the Mueller investigation, and the Russia connections.",
  "On Saturday, we heard from the company Bayer, announcing, quote, we have stopped advertising on Laura Ingraham's show.",
  "And I've been talking to staffers in markets, David, that say they're sickened by this, they're uncomfortable with it.",
  "Matt Pearce of \"The Los Angeles Times\" took the opposite view, saying, \"Journalism is activism in its most basic form.",
  "I think, if you look at recent events, I think it shows that we are slipping as a society because of some in the news.",
  "And last month, I reported that the company was mandating its local stations to produce these media-bashing promos.",
  "[11:35:00] And I think, therefore, for Roseanne, it's more about what the show -- you know, how the show plays out.",
  "DAVID ZURAWIK, MEDIA CRITIC, THE BALTIMORE SUN: Well, Brian, I agree with let's meet their speech with more speech.",
  "We jumped to the \"Friends\" world, where everyone is living in impossibly expensive apartments and don't have jobs.",
  "But we also have a terrible history in this country of network television when it comes to working-class sitcoms.",
  "STELTER: Shouldn't the president have someone by his side to see if his tweets are true before he sends them out?",
  "Look, I think reporters and anchors, especially when you centralize the message -- and this is what's important.",
  "I think Sinclair has the potential for that, and I think in some ways, people react to that when they see this.",
  "It would probably be helpful to step back from like NewsNow YouTruth.org and whatever -- that's not a real one.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTELTER: And Fox is backing her up, confirming this was a preplanned spring break vacation.",
  "And not just my view, and but a lot of my former colleagues who I would talk to, we would sit there and watch.",
  "For months and months, almost for a year at this point, Hannity has been waging a war on Mueller and the FBI.",
  "And I think that there's distinctions for me as a journalist and also as someone that wants to demand change.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSTELTER: Yes, I don't think Anderson Cooper has received a congrats phone call about that one.",
  "I think you have to also take into account the idea that this is, what, weeks ago, right, maybe a month ago.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nPROMOS: The sharing of bias and false news has become all too common on social media.",
  "I find it a disingenuous argument to say they've been put into or provoked or paid into becoming activists.",
  "STELTER: Well, look, the Bezos/\"Post\" connection, this Amazon issue, it calls to mind AT&T and Time Warner.",
  "Choosing what you want people to know is a form of activism, even if it's not the march and protest kind.\"",
  "And to provide opinion that is masquerading as news without providing the facts, I think, is a disservice.",
  "And later, a segment you have to see about the effects of the pro- Trump media's attacks against the FBI.",
  "ATAMANUIK: Well, I think the media has, but, you know, Brian, a lot of the media is sort of ahistorical.",
  "But you can read about them on CNN.com and on The Daily Beast and other sites that have done explainers.",
  "They're also, especially David Hogg and some of the others, incredibly media savvy in a good, good way.",
  "I think it's dangerous to see these ad boycott attempts happening more and more often in this country.",
  "And it -- you know, it's really -- it's a mirror image in a way of the way Vladimir Putin runs Russia.",
  "Her comment prompted all sorts of responses about journalism vs. activism or whether they're similar.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTELTER: We're going to get into that with a former FBI agent right after this.",
  "And so I think we have had a long run of seeing people impossibly successful without making effort.",
  "So it wasn't too much of a surprise that the revamp of her show \"Roseanne\" was a big hit this week.",
  "But this is something Kelly did try to do, where he wanted the president to at least run by tweets.",
  "But the mere fact that you had -- you know, Manafort was gone from the campaign by August of 2016.",
  "As long as that little cube is spinning in the bottom of the screen saying news, folks wants news.",
  "But I think that the partnership of the two is the only reason that we are able to make a change.",
  "Hannity, of course, has been a loyal attack dog in the battle against Robert Mueller and the FBI.",
  "There's clearly a lot more we'll want to know about what the nature of those communications were.",
  "It's what the great -- Greeks said they were doing with drama, the ancient Greeks and catharsis.",

  "When we look at this dinner with Sean Hannity and the president, I don't fault the president.",
  "I mean, this is presidential pique, government by presidential pique, rather than by policy.",
  "No, I don't think any reporters are because the truth is important and facts are important.",
  "It didn't get nearly as much attention because of Stormy Daniels and a lot of other things.",
  "[11:20:03] One, they have a great moral authority that most people in the media don't have.",
  "But in the world of commercial media, nothing is more powerful than an advertiser boycott.",
  "Now, here's an incomplete list of the advertisers that have cut ties with Ingraham's show.",
  "It's like, as opposed to running away from politics, this show is running toward politics.",
  "And, at the same time, you know, Roseanne was incredibly successful for a very long time.",
  "Coming up here, why Fox's Laura Ingraham is taking a vacation amid an advertiser boycott.",
  "I would really rather not go into details about them, because they're so uncomfortable.",
  "She was an active feminist, all the way from her youth through into her comedy career.",
  "And media does both reflect our state of being, but also can imbue our state of being.",
  "And if you look at these attacks, Brian, kind of throughout, there's one common theme.",
  "So, to me, that's where the very clear delineation is between journalism and activism.",
  "What's interesting is that on Friday night, Ingraham said, hey, I'm going on vacation.",
  "Can I ask you, are you tired of this point of writing fact checks about the president?",
  "JILL COLVIN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: It's an interesting question.",
