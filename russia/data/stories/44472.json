  "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Facebook Inc executive said in an internal memo in 2016 that the social media company needed to pursue adding users above all else, BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday, prompting disavowals from the executive and Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe memo from Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, had not been previously reported as Facebook faces inquiries over how it handles personal information and the tactics the social media company has used to grow to 2.1 billion users.",
  "Facebook users, advertisers and investors have been in an uproar for months over a series of scandals, most recently privacy practices that allowed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to obtain personal information on 50 million Facebook members.",
  "“Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas, if only to eliminate them,” Bosworth’s statement said.",
  "All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends,” he wrote in the memo, which BuzzFeed published on its website.",
  "Bosworth confirmed the memo’s authenticity but in a statement he disavowed its message, saying its goal had been to encourage debate.",
  "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the Facebook F8 conference in San Francisco, California April 12, 2016.",
  "Bosworth wrote in the June 2016 memo that some “questionable” practices were all right if the result was connecting people.",
  "Bosworth said Thursday that he did not agree with the post today “and I didn’t agree with it even when I wrote it.",
  "Zuckerberg stood by Bosworth, who goes by the nickname “Boz,” while distancing himself from the memo’s contents.",
  "Zuckerberg is expected to testify at a hearing with U.S. lawmakers as soon as April.",
  "This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly.",
  "We’ve never believed the ends justify the means,” Zuckerberg said in a statement.",
  "He also urged fellow employees not to let potential negatives slow them down.",
  "Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.",
  "“Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things.",
  "“Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies.",
  "“That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified.",
  "All the questionable contact importing practices.",
  "And still we connect people,” he wrote."
