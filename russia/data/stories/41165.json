  "\"The meeting -- and the subsequent drafting of a misleading statement on Air Force One -- has become one of the most important focal points of the Russia investigations, both on Capitol Hill and within Mueller's team, because it provides one of the clearest indications that the Trump campaign was willing to entertain collusion with Russians,\" the report said.",

  "In addition to the Comey and Flynn firings, key issues from Bannon's time in the White House are likely to include Trump's decision to fire then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates and any pressure the President may have exerted on Sessions about the FBI investigation into Russia's interference with the election.",
  "Michael Flynn's calls to the Russian ambassador\n\nMueller's investigators may also have questions about Bannon's activities during the presidential transition, a period that lawmakers on Capitol Hill were interested in when Bannon made his first appearance before the House Intelligence Committee.",

  "Bannon also claimed in the Wolff book that there was \"zero\" chance that Trump Jr. didn't introduce the Russians to his father, an allegation Trump Jr. and others have denied.",
  "'Fire and Fury' revelations\n\nThe former Breitbart News executive's propensity for spouting off in colorful fashion appears to have raised investigators' interest in Bannon.",
