  "\"Once the witnesses' attorneys have indicated what their clients are willing to do voluntarily, Grassley will consult with ranking member Feinstein on whether to issue subpoenas.\"",
  "\"Chairman Grassley and ranking member [Sen. Dianne] Feinstein have made clear that they intend to hear from all witnesses for next Wednesday's hearing,\" he said.",
