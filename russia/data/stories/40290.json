  "On Sept. 29, the Commission on Offender Review produced a memorandum titled “Initial Parole Interview: Rationale / Basis for Recommendation.” That document cites Griffin’s “outstanding and above satisfactory work ratings,” notes that he is a GED dorm tutor and a math classroom tutor, and says he “has received no processed disciplinary reports since his initial incarceration.” It also includes a lengthy list of largely faith-related programs the 56-year-old Griffin has completed, among them “Becoming a Contagious Christian” and “Forward in Faith.”\n\nGiven his “lack of [disciplinary reports] and program participation,” the memo states, the investigator assigned to look over Griffin’s parole case recommended that he “be referred to the [Florida International University] lifer’s program” upon his presumptive parole release date.",
  "The Florida International University lifer’s program, per a 2016 op-ed in the Miami Herald, consists of a series of workshops and classes that prepare men for the transition “from institutionalized prison life back into the free world, and not one has returned to prison for committing another violent crime.” An essay on the website Forgotten Majority notes that an inmate may enter the program only “through direct recommendation from the Florida Parole Commission.” It further says that the “coveted Program is the exit door from state prison for enrollees who successfully complete.”\n\nIn an interview with James Risen and Judy L. Thomas of Newsweek in 1998, Michael Frederick Griffin showed no remorse whatsoever for the murder of Dr. David Gunn.",
  "“The only people who should be in fear and terror are the abortion doctors,” he said, explaining that “they’ve got to have a reckoning one day with God.” Griffin added that a doctor performing abortions today “should stop what he’s doing and get saved and repent of it.” When the interviewer, Tara Brown, replied, “Well, he says he’s not going to stop,” Griffin answered, “He’ll stop one day, take my word for it.” He said that was “a promise.”\n\nBrown ended her report by noting that the “good news is, [Griffin] is unlikely to ever get out of jail.” Griffin closed his part of the interview by urging his acolytes to commit murder.",
  "Florida Commission on Offender Review\n\nIn his letter and in our phone conversation, Gunn Jr. noted Chapter 947 of the Florida state code, which states, “No person shall be placed on parole merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties assigned in prison.” Even so, the parole interview report recommending Griffin’s admission to the lifer’s program—“the exit door from state prison”—does not mention anything beyond good behavior and the completion of classes.",
  "A report issued earlier this year noted that attacks on clinics are occurring at higher rates right now than at any time in the past 20 years, with “34.2 percent of U.S. abortion providers report[ing] ‘severe violence or threats of violence’ in the first half of 2016.” These attacks are carried out by people who believe they are above the laws that define murder and homicide and that they are justified in impeding every abortion by any means necessary.",
  "More recently, Robert Lewis Dear, who killed three people in a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, reportedly told police that Griffin’s follower Hill was “somebody that he thought very highly of.” After murdering a police officer and two civilians, Dear allegedly said, “No more baby parts.”\n\nDr. David Gunn was shot and killed in 1993 on his way into a medical clinic that performed abortions.",
  "While the doctor bled to death, Griffin calmly surrendered to the police, saying, “I just shot someone.” Those attending the protest with Griffin showed no alarm at the shooting, a witness told the Washington Post’s William Booth: “It looked like they were just happy.”\n\nAt Griffin’s murder trial, his defense counsel would blame his actions on a pro-life leader named John Burt.",
  "It was more like anti-murder.”) Shannon, who like Hill was connected to the Christian terrorist group the Army of God, called Griffin “the awesomest greatest hero of our time.” Shannon is now serving a prison sentence for a failed attempt to murder Dr. George Tiller, as well as for her part in bombings and arson attacks on other clinics.",
  "… I felt like I had another word from the Lord for him: that he was accused and convicted of murder and that his sentence was Genesis 9:6, ‘Whosoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood shall be shed.’ ”\n\nGriffin hadn’t changed his attitude in 2010, when he sat down for a jailhouse interview with 60 Minutes Australia.",
  "That killing began what I think of as years of siege.”\n\n“Their blood being shed in their clinics and stuff is just retribution from God for their acts.” Michael Griffin\n\nAs Michael E. Miller and Yanan Wang have painstakingly detailed, one hallmark of all these clinic murders is that the killers show no remorse.",
  "In a phone interview, Gunn Jr. told me a victims’ services representative from the Florida Commission on Offender Review informed him roughly a year ago that Griffin’s hearing would be scheduled for the fall of 2017 and that the commission would likely set his presumptive parole release date at that time.",
  "“Those extremists would see that Michael Griffin’s sentence is over and might make the calculation that they could risk a couple of decades in jail to kill an abortion provider.”\n\nIn his letter to the Commission on Offender Review, Gunn Jr. describes how the world has changed since his father’s murder.",
  "In interviews with the communications director of the Florida Commission on Offender Review, I was told that the decision to set a presumptive parole release date is made by the three commissioners themselves and does not in any way rely on the commission investigator’s recommendation.",
  "Three days later, Griffin “emerged from a hedgerow where he was hiding with all the discipline and cold calculation of a trained assassin, and pumped three pistol rounds into my dad’s back.”\n\nGunn Jr. is now 47 years old and works as a case manager at a law firm in Birmingham, Alabama.",
  "Today, seven years after that interview aired on Australian television, Griffin says he takes “full responsibility for my actions.” He makes that claim in a four-page handwritten letter to the Commission on Offender Review in which he argues that he should be granted parole.",
  "The facts and circumstances surrounding this crime, in total, indicate that society will be best served and protected with his continued incarceration.”\n\nIn his letter to the Commission on Offender Review, Gunn Jr. points to the killers who claimed to be inspired by Griffin.",
  "It is illogical to reach any other conclusion but that parole and clemency for this particular inmate will have disastrous effects on the lives of countless people who engage in professions or live lifestyles terrorists like inmate Griffin disagree with or find offensive.",
  "May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected.”\n\nIn December 1994, a 22-year-old anti-abortion activist named John Salvi III walked into a clinic in Brookline, Massachusetts, and started shooting, killing two and eventually injuring five others.",
  "They had no shortage of patients but lacked a committed doctor.” Gunn, who had three children, the oldest of whom died in a car accident, soon began making a weekly run from Eufala, Alabama, to Columbus to Montgomery, Alabama, to Mobile, Alabama, to Pensacola.",
  "He explained to his son that “women would suffer without care if he refused as there was a shortage of doctors willing to [provide abortion services] in the area.”\n\nIn the last year of his life, Gunn was stalked, threatened, harassed, and intimidated.",
  "In his autobiography, Hill wrote that the act of taking Gunn’s life was comparable to “killing a Nazi concentration camp ‘doctor.’ ” Hill, who sat through Griffin’s trial, murdered Dr. John Britton and James Barrett in Pensacola on July 29, 1994.",
  "“Releasing Michael Griffin would … send a horrific message to those who believe that abortion should be stopped at all costs,” David Cohen, co-author of Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism, told me via email.",
  "“When my dad was killed 24 years ago, it was fairly shocking news, especially to those outside the abortion rights and provider communities, to see just how violent and volatile the anti-abortion movement had become of late,” he writes.",
  "After Gunn’s killing, Burt had announced, “We don’t condone this, but we have to remember that Dr. Gunn has killed thousands and thousands of babies.” At trial, Griffin claimed he’d been manipulated by Burt and others.",
  "It is as though doctors, nurses, clinic owners and patients must alter their expectations of civility and liberty, and simply get used to living in terror under fear of their lives and the lives of their families.”",
  "Mobile Press-Register/AP\n\nImmediately after Gunn’s killing, militant anti-abortion activist Paul Hill began circulating what became known as the “defensive action statement,” condoning and justifying the killing.",
  "Ralf-Finn Hestoft/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nAlthough Florida effectively abolished parole in 1983, those who committed first-degree murder prior to 1995 are part of a small group of inmates who remain eligible.",

  "Kathryn Kolbert, a reproductive rights lawyer who argued Planned Parenthood v. Casey at the Supreme Court in 1992, told me Michael Griffin’s murder of David Gunn “gave permission to everyone else.",
  "Today we think of this as the first targeted killing of an abortion doctor in America—the murder that led to passage of the FACE Act, which made it a federal crime to block access to clinics.",
  "It also established the battle lines in an ever more violent and nihilistic war against abortion providers, one that has led to the murders of nearly a dozen more people in the decades since.",
  "“If you parole the first person to murder a doctor for providing his patients with a legal service the assassin finds morally reprehensible, are you setting a dangerous precedent?” he asks.",

  "Dad greeted protesters outside a clinic in Montgomery with an impromptu solo performance of Happy Birthday to You celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade [ruling].",
