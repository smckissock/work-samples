  "Proppant costs– While most of the P10 screaming wells we see in the northern Midland and southern Delaware are the result of super high-intensity completions using upwards of 3,000 lbs/ft of proppant, the best wells in the southern Midland use between 2,000 and 2,500 lbs/ft.",
  "Firstly, the investment thesis of many private equity-backed companies is that bringing new technology back to rocks once deemed under-productive is a winning strategy – see virtually every Haynesville/Cotton Valley deal in 2016.",
  "Private equity is back on the scene\n\nThe line-up of operators in the southern Midland has quietly evolved over the past couple years into a fresh class with private equity capital committed to pushing development forward.",
  "Advances in geosteering and a better understanding of high proppant loads and pumping schedules unlocked the Delaware Basin in 2015 and 2016, but these technologies are proving beneficial in the southern Midland too.",
  "The optimal project today is a three-well pad where a rig can, after a spudder rig sets 1,000 ft of surface casing, be assembled and drill three extended lateral wells then moved to the next pad in under a month.",
  "Pressure pumping– Because the southern Midland has a lower pressure gradient than other parts of the Permian and average proppant loads are smaller, operators don’t require costly stage 2 or 3 pumping services.",
  "Multiple operators have sung the praises of the University Lands response to low prices, particularly a sliding scale royalty structure that provides incentive to drill in low price environments.",
  "The Texas Pacifico railway runs directly through Barnhart (Irion County) and Rankin (Upton County), making logistics easier and trucking distances shorter than in other parts of the basin.",
  "Even if we assume 15% cost inflation, the offset from 20% productivity gains and favourable royalty terms means the breakeven gap to premier parts of the play is now less than $10/bbl.",
  "Typically, a five-skid pump pattern is sufficient for completions, whereas the northern Midland often utilises a 10-skid pattern and Delaware operators sometimes use 15.",
  "A combined 35 horizontal rigs are active in Upton, Reagan, Irion and Crockett counties – impressive considering there are 52 active rigs in the entire Williston Basin.",
  "EOG sold its Crockett County position to Amistad Energy (Kayne Anderson) and its Irion, Reagan and Schleicher County position to Sequitur (Acon Investments).",
  "Other operators that will play a role are Foreland Operating (Vortus Investments), Hunt Oil (TSSP), PT Petroleum (Kayne Anderson) and Broad Oak II (EnCap).",
  "Further, last-mile logistics to move proppant from railway to well site can be complex and expensive, particularly in remote areas of the Delaware Basin.",
  "Secondly, there are large swaths of University Lands lease positions, and the University Lands office has proven to be a strong partner to work with.",
  "EP Energy expanded its position when it bought BHP’s assets, and Apollo Global Management will help fund development of specific tranches of wells.",
  "Favourable royalty overrides are highly beneficial to an operator and often overlooked by industry observers as having influence on activity.",
  "It looks like operators will first encounter pricing increases for pressure pumping, followed by rising proppant costs and then rig rates.",
  "Rig rates– A key component to success in the southern Midland is high-accuracy drilling targeting specific windows of the Wolfcamp.",
  "We have recently examined the inevitability of service price inflation and believe the booming Permian is most exposed for 2017.",
  "Sable Permian Resources (Energy and Minerals Group/OnyxPoint Global Management) is one of the most active operators in the area.",
  "That means a rig can realistically drill 30 wells a year, more than double that achievable in competing parts of the basin.",
  "As of 1 May, 2017, OnyxPoint Global Management and Energy and Minerals Group are controlling shareholders of the company.",
  "Operators are also typically using only two strings of casing, compared with three or four in other parts of the basin.",
  "The southern Midland boasts some advantages, perhaps none bigger than a comparative edge in the face of cost inflation.",
  "The conventional wisdom from 2014 was that the southern Midland was fringe, so what has changed to bring activity back?",
  "Wood Mackenzie estimated last year that the southern part of the basin needed $48/bbl to see material activity return.",
  "Our North America Well Analysis Tool (NAWAT) is a wonderful way to visualize and benchmark these operators’ positions.",
  "Prior to the booms in the northern Midland and southern Delaware, there was also a major influx of private equity.",
  "ConocoPhillips’ position, acquired in the 2011 University Lands lease sale, is now owned by Henry Resources.",
  "This post has been edited to clarify the ownership of Permian Resources, now Sable Permian Resources.",
  "Don’t look now, but the rig count in the once-forgotten southern Midland Basin is on the rise again.",
  "Early results from 2016 wells suggest they are 20% more productive per lateral foot than in 2014.",
  "Between these two factors, Wood Mackenzie estimates 2017 breakevens are down to $40/bbl.",
  "Most of the basin could see up to 25% service pricing inflation by the end of the year.",
  "Instead of 25% cost inflation, operators in the southern Midland expect less than 10%.",
  "Forget what you thought you knew about the southern Midland – it’s a new play today.",
  "However, the rocks are shallower and easier to drill, which pushes drill days down.",
  "Fleur de Lis acquired Devon's Irion and Crockett County position last year.",
  "Regionally speaking, the southern Midland fares well in all three buckets.",
  "As such, high-specification rigs must be considered a requirement.",
  "But there's a lot more to it than just some price support.",
  "Oil price is, of course, the simple answer.",
  "In a word, no – and for two major reasons.",
  "No wonder the rig count is on the rise.",
  "How does it fare in a crowded basin?",
  "Is $48/bbl still the magic number?"
