  "Groups such as the Center for Security Policy, which argue that \"nearly every\" Muslim American group, including campus student groups, are extremist sleeper cells bent on launching \"stealth jihad\" and subverting the Constitution, have raised tens of millions in donations, which they use, along with preexisting connections to conservative media institutions, to push anti-Muslim hysteria and conspiracy theories.",
  "An absolutely horrific demonstration of Islamophobia in the U.S. https://t.co/wMFZD6n7Ci — INSIDER (@thisisinsider) November 27, 2015\n\nOn the Tuesday after the Paris terror attacks, a Virginia civil engineer named Samer Shalaby carried a few poster boards into Spotsylvania County's small, low-ceilinged community forum room to present plans to replace Fredericksburg's aging Islamic center.",
  "Hosts have repeated bigoted falsehoods, for example that female genital mutilation is an inherently Muslim problem (in fact, it is a regional practice that crosses religious lines) or that restrictions on women driving are \"commonplace\" in the Muslim world (in fact, it is restricted to one country, Saudi Arabia, that represents 2 percent of the global Muslim population).",
  "America is working very hard to ignore this problem — even as it spirals out of control\n\nWhen the Trump supporter demanded \"when can we get rid of 'em,\" there was an odd reaction in the media: to note that the man had only been referring to fictitious \"training camps\" and not to all Muslims, and that therefore his statement was not an incitement to sectarian violence.",
  "Obviously, actual attacks on Muslims are worse than implicit or explicit threats — and, make no mistake, when militias stand outside an Islamic center, even if they have no intention of using violence, they are conveying a threat — but they serve the same goal of inflicting suffering on Muslims meant to drive them into the shadows or out of public society altogether.",
  "The guest, a member of an anti-Muslim group known as the Clarion Project (one of the groups, mentioned above, that has worked to mainstream extremist anti-Muslim ideas), suggested that seemingly peaceful Muslim American families were in fact hiding vast training facilities that, if left undisturbed, would be used to launch terror attacks across the US.",

  "Host Jeanine Pirro once issued a breathtaking seven-minute monologue calling for the United States to arm death squads throughout the Muslim world to kill all Islamists and members of Islamist organizations, though many of those organizations are avowedly peaceful and have millions of members, including women and children.",
  "It is a climate of active and widespread hate that has included incitements to violence and actual violence against an American demographic group that is too small to compel political action on its own behalf, yet large enough to be nationally visible at a moment when being visible is dangerous.",
  "The politics of Islamophobia are everywhere in America\n\nIslamophobic attitudes initially spiked after President Obama's election — a continuation of the dog-whistle politics that Obama is a secret Muslim, or at least suspiciously un-hostile toward Islam — but have been resurfacing more recently.",
  "Though her stunt likely seemed silly to many Americans — another far-flung legislator saying something outlandish — it was neither isolated nor fringe, but rather part of a concerted and deliberate campaign to promote anti-Muslim fear and hatred that has coincided with anti-Muslim violence.",
  "The threat of violence often has the same theatrical point as violence itself: to terrify and intimidate, to inflict psychological suffering on the targeted group in the form of fear and alienation, to force that targeted group to live a little bit less in the open and more in the shadows.",
  "Shalaby's presentation was meant to formalize his application for a zoning permit — the very dullest sort of dull civic meeting — but as a crowd filed in, filling every seat and standing shoulder to shoulder along the walls, it became clear that they were not there to discuss zoning.",
  "This September, when a Texas school had a 14-year-old boy named Ahmed Mohamed arrested for bringing in a homemade clock, it again looked like a moment when Islamophobia had brought America to such absurd lengths that surely we would have to acknowledge things had gone too far.",
  "The line about \"training camps\" referred to a conspiracy theory that has been festering for months and growing from the far-right fringes to the right-wing mainstream: that Muslim American communities throughout the US are sheltering secret terrorist training camps in the US.",
  "In other words, the campaign deflected criticism that it had indulged anti-Obama conspiracy theories by instead saying it had indulged Islamophobic conspiracy theories that have, in the recent past, been the basis of attempted terrorist violence against American families.",
  "How right-wing media is mainstreaming violent Islamophobia\n\nFox News has taken this media treatment of Islam to the next logical step, telling its millions of viewers over and over that Muslims are a threat who must be feared and dealt with forcefully, even violently.",
  "But what is worst is arguably not these incidents of over Islamophobia on cable news, but rather the degree to which American media treats the question of whether Muslims are inherently violent or backward as a valid debate in which both sides should be aired.",
  "When the incident became a minor scandal — mostly over Trump's apparent support for the idea that Obama is Muslim — the Trump campaign responded by insisting that the question and Trump's \"we're gonna look into it\" were in fact about the \"training camps.\"",
  "When national media was slow to pick up the story of what had happened in Chapel Hill, many Muslim Americans used the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter to call attention to the murders and, just as crucially, to the growing hatred toward Muslims in this country.",

  "Both Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz have proposed barring refugees but making special exemptions for Christian refugees — again, a policy that only makes sense if you see refugees as threats not because they are refugees or foreign but because they are Muslim.",
  "and presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal has falsely claimed that Muslims in the UK have set up \"no-go zones\" that police refuse to enter and where Sharia law prevails, and that Muslim immigrants coming to the US are an \"invasion\" and \"colonization.\"",
  "Ben Carson compared Syrian refugees to rabid dogs; he has also said that Muslims should be barred from the presidency and has falsely claimed, among other things, that Islamic law requires that \"people following other religions must be killed.\"",
  "Thankfully, so far most of that violence has targeted Islamic buildings rather than people — a series of mosques and Islamic cemeteries have been vandalized — though even this is rightly perceived by Muslims as a threat of more deadly attacks.",
  "In late January, a Texas state legislator protested the state capital's Muslim Capitol Day, meant to promote tolerance, by demanding that any Muslim \"publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws\" before entering her office.",
  "Because many in the media continue to indulge Islamophobia as a valid position, they implicitly tell their audiences that it is acceptable to hate Muslims and indeed important to question whether Muslims are inherently inferior.",
  "In the first days after the terror attacks in Paris, American politics became consumed in debate over whether the attacks showed that the US should slow or altogether halt its already-small program to admit Syrian refugees.",
  "That December, a man in Kansas City wrote on his SUV that the Quran was a \"disease worse than Ebola,\" and then drove the vehicle into a 15-year-old Muslim boy in front of a local mosque, severing his legs and killing him.",
  "It's not that Trump caused anti-Muslim violence, but rather that his comments — widely believed and legitimately popular among a slice of Americans — are the leading edge of an Islamophobic movement that is also violent.",

  "The day after the Texas militia incident, Trump claimed that \"thousands\" of Muslims in New Jersey had cheered the 9/11 terrorist attacks — a claim he has repeated over and over despite it being frequently disproven.",
  "The fact that these conspiracy theories have nonetheless received two extended hearings on Fox News, and were the subject of a Trump rally, shows just how out of control America's Islamophobia problem has grown.",
  "HBO host Bill Maher frequently rants against Islam and its adherents, saying, for example, that \"vast numbers of Muslims want humans to die for holding a different idea\" and share \"too much in common with ISIS.\"",
  "In one bizarre segment, during an interview with Muslim-American human rights lawyer Arsalan Iftikhar, CNN host Don Lemon interrupted him mid-sentence to ask, for no obvious reason at all, \"Do you support ISIS?\"",
  "The conversation has at moments drifted, tellingly, away from the refugee issue entirely and more explicitly into what it was always about: a desire to treat Muslims as dangerous threats who must be controlled.",
  "But in fact the opposite happened: The more information that came out showing Syrian refugees had played little or no role in Paris, the more vigorously Americans debated blocking Syrian refugees in response.",
  "CNN has promoted a kind of \"he said, she said\" conception of Islam, in which it is valid and worthwhile to debate whether Muslims make for inferior people and societies, thus mainstreaming more overt bigotry.",
  "The film went on to become one of the most successful war films in American history, to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and to inspire a wave of death threats against Muslims and Arabs.",
  "As the debate developed, it became clearer why this was: The backlash against Syrian refugees wasn't really about Paris, but rather about a deeper fear of Muslims that has been building for some time.",
  "In part, this is about hostility toward immigrants, irrespective of their religion — a central issue for Trump and his campaign for months, and one he's pressed on Latin American immigration as well.",
  "In January, Warner Bros. released American Sniper, an Iraq War film that portrays Iraqis as an undifferentiated mass of terrorists and terrorist sympathizers who can only be confronted with violence.",
  "The morality of killing Iraqi civilians is raised only so the hero protagonist can shout down whoever has had the gall to question his decisions by explaining that those civilians were no innocents.",
  "So when the Trump supporter warned of the \"training camps\" and said he wanted to \"get rid of 'em,\" the thing he wanted to \"get rid of\" was not camps but rather peaceful Muslim American communities.",
  "On Thanksgiving, just a few days later, a cab driver in Pittsburgh who is also an immigrant from Morocco picked up a passenger who accosted him with questions about his background and about ISIS.",
  "\"In 20 years I have not heard such intolerance and hatred from political leaders in this society,\" Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Guardian.",
  "Then, in February, came the Chapel Hill murders: A man known for both his anger problems and his hatred of religion shot to death three university students, all Muslim, in his apartment complex.",
  "The murders of the three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, this February, took us a step closer to seeing the problem of American Islamophobia and dealing with it, but it did not get us there.",
  "Tellingly, Vox's coverage of that Islamophobia has drawn us more threats of violence, including threats of sexual violence against women writers, than any other subject I have ever covered.",
  "It's hard to ignore the appearance that the focus on refugees, though refugees played no currently known role in the Paris attacks, is at least in part about generalized anti-Muslim fear.",
  "This spring, the FBI arrested a Tennessee man named Robert Doggart who was plotting to lead a far-right militia on a killing spree against a heavily Muslim community in New York state.",
  "The January terrorist attack against Charlie Hebdo magazine, in Paris, provoked a wave of Islamophobic violence in France as well as many threats to Muslims here in the United States.",
  "Yet the fact that only Trump drew widespread outrage shows how accustomed we have become to out-in-the-open anti-Muslim prejudice in this country, and the extremes that now tolerate.",
  "In one scene, the film's protagonist and namesake shoots an Iraqi woman and child to death — an act the film tacitly approves by later showing them as having been carrying a grenade.",
  "And not just as rhetorical devices for metaphorical struggles against extremism, but rather to describe a narrative of a literal, actual war against \"radical Muslims\" or \"Islamists.\"",
  "It is frightening to consider what it would take, if a triple murder and the persecution of an innocent child did not do it, to force Americans to recognize its Islamophobia problem.",
  "Over the past year, much of the media has treated the rise of ISIS in the Middle East as an indictment of Islam itself, a sign that Muslims are somehow less human and more violent.",
  "By September, an Iowa poll found that only 49 percent of Republicans there believed that Islam should be legal, with 30 percent saying it should be illegal and 21 percent \"unsure.\"",
  "The militia leader responded to criticism of the list by writing on Facebook, \"If we had a hit list and wanted to run down that list, you would have already seen it on the news.\"",

  "As French authorities identified the attackers, each turned out to be not Syrian at all, refugee or otherwise, but rather a European Union citizen who was French or Belgian.",
  "Both Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz had, weeks earlier, called for accepting refugees from Syria only if they are Christian — thus effectively banning Syrian refugees who are Muslim.",
  "Trump was widely and correctly criticized for this, accused of wanting to reproduce discriminatory policies like those of prewar Europe, when Jews were forcibly registered.",

  "Three days later, on November 20, Donald Trump told an NBC News reporter that he would \"certainly\" implement a system to register and track Muslims in the United States.",
  "Hence Trump's suggestion that he would support a federal \"database\" of all Muslims in the US and might even require Muslim Americans to carry special identification.",
  "The hashtag asked Americans to acknowledge the climate, one that many non-Muslims still refuse to see, in which Muslims are treated with open fear and suspicion.",
  "But looking at the timeline of events since the Paris attacks, and indeed in the months before them, it becomes clear that Trump isn't actually the problem here.",
  "Maybe some sanity will finally emerge in our political discourse, or cable media will confront its own role and start pushing back on a problem it helped create.",
  "But the reaction against Syrian refugees, for all its similarities to other anti-immigration movements, also has a clear and consistent religious element to it.",

  "Many Americans presumed that the Paris attacks had been conducted by people who'd arrived from Syria and feared the same happening here.",
  "Among Trump supporters in Iowa, hostility toward Muslims was higher but not that much higher: 36 percent said Islam should be outlawed.",
  "For example, Fox News's Andrea Tantaros, in making a point about \"the history of Islam,\" argued, \"You can't solve it with a dialogue.",

  "The United States does not officially track the number of citizens who are Muslim, but it's likely a few million.",
