  "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed major sanctions on Friday against 24 Russians, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.”\n\nThe action, taken under pressure from the U.S. Congress, freezes the U.S. assets of oligarchs such as aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of Putin, and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, whose family controls Russia’s largest gold producer, Polyus.",
  "But Daniel Fried, the U.S. government’s former coordinator of sanctions policy under President Barack Obama, said the sanctions list “is a solid piece of work.”\n\nPutin’s government has been blamed for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent living in Britain last month and the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response.",
  "SDN stands for “Specially Designated National.”\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nA Cyprus-based company tied to Deripaska sued Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, two former aides to Trump’s presidential campaign, in a New York state court in January, accusing them of misappropriating more than $18.9 million earmarked for deals in Ukraine in 2008.",
  "“But first of all we would like to recommend that Washington discard illusions that we can be spoken to in the language of sanctions.”\n\nOLIGARCHS AND ELITES\n\nThe sanctions could hurt the Russian economy, especially the aluminum, financial and energy sectors, and are a clear message to Putin and his inner circle of U.S. displeasure.",
  "Deripaska called the decision to target him “very unfortunate but not unexpected.”\n\n“Certainly the grounds for putting my name on the list of SDNs as provided by U.S. officials are groundless, ridiculous and absurd,” he said, in a statement sent to Reuters by a spokesperson for his industrial group Basic Element.",
  "Although they are under European Union jurisdiction, they will not want to fall foul of any U.S. legislation\n\nDeripaska’s blacklisting will also reverberate around the world because his empire has a global footprint and counts major multinationals as partners, including German automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).",
