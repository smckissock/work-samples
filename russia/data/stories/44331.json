  "Answer by Mohamed Sarwat, Computer Science faculty at Arizona State University, on Quora:\n\nOver the past few decades, computer science research, either in industry or academia, has led to ground breaking technology innovations such as the internet, which continues to change our lives.",
  "The Master of Computer Science offered by ASU both on campus and online via Coursera offer subjects related to cutting edge technology in the areas of big data, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.",
  "Moreover, the emergence of Bitcoins led to the development of the Blockchain technology, which enables the robust exchange of cryptocurrencies and digital assets without the need of a central authority.",
  "Generally, computer science research has been driven by one of the following factors:\n\n(1) New hardware: Moore's law always impacts the way we design algorithms and implement software systems.",
  "Data system support for the Internet of Things: Internet of Things simply means that smart devices equipped with sensors and actuators keep generating data from the local environment.",
  "Other important, yet underdeveloped, research areas include but are not limited to leveraging AI to improve the healthcare system, transportation, and global security challenges.",
  "The offered courses give students hands-on experience with state-of-the-art technology and hence prepare them to pursue a research-oriented degree/career in the future.",
  "Personal data protection systems: Recent data breaches, e.g., Equifax, and data abuse such as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica incident have triggered a red alert.",
  "Such incidents call for designing and developing robust personal data management systems that protect not only privacy, but also data ownership and transparency.",
  "(2) New applications: Emerging applications such as autonomous cars and cryptocurrency have called for novel computing systems that can enable such applications.",
  "This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.",
  "Furthermore, solid state drives (SSDs) changed the way we design storage systems, which were previously tailored for the mechanical hard drive (HDD).",
  "In the post-Moore's Law era, advances in cloud computing affected so many sub-areas of computer science like operating systems and database systems.",
  "Autonomous cars triggered AI and data science researchers to develop novel algorithms to enable effective, robust, and safe self-driving cars.",
  "originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.",
  "In the future, advances in quantum computing computing research may drastically change the way we design and implement computer systems.",
  "For instance, companies like Oracle may provide a version of their Oracle Database Management System (DBMS) that is GDPR-compliant.",
  "Finding effective data management strategies between the edge and the cloud could have a huge impact on real-time applications.",
  "The flow of data from devices to the cloud and back is currently done in a random manner, wasting time, resource, and energy.",
  "Recently, quantum computing promises lightning-speed calculations as opposed to classic electronics-based computers.",
  "The question of how existing data systems adapt to such regulations may impact how companies run businesses today.",
  "That may lead to tremendous changes in the DBMS stack from data storage systems to query processing algorithms.",
  "Such devices (i.e., things) then send such data to the cloud via the internet for further processing.",
  "Beyond these though, I believe the following areas also need further attention:\n\n1.",
  "What are some underdeveloped areas in computer science research right now (2018)?",
  "You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.",
  "GDPR recently took effect in Europe.",
  "More questions:",
  "2."
