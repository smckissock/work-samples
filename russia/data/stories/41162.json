  "And even if it comes from a Russian, or a German, or an American, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nHe also argued that because, according to those in the meeting, there was no actual exchange of “dirt”—instead, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya pressed them on the Magnitsky Act, a law detested by the Kremlin—the conversation was licit.",
  "Last month, trying to prove that Trump had not committed any campaign-finance violations, a legal argument, his account of Trump’s reimbursement to fixer Michael Cohen for a payoff to porn actress and director Stormy Daniels created a political mess.",

  "As with much of the discussion over Russian interference, it conflates the legal and political realms.",
  "“When I ran against [Hillary Clinton], they were looking for dirt on me every day,” Giuliani said.",
  "“He had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting,” Trump said, referring to his eldest son.",
