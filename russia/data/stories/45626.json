  "In Medium’s case, the company actually clarifies that it “may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances” and offers several examples including “to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards” and “academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonomization.”\n\nAs with Facebook, Medium’s allowance for data transfer to a “service provider or partner” without constraints on what kinds of partners it will transfer data to or what can be done with that data leaves open nearly any imaginable data exchange, including with commercial data brokers.",
  "In Medium’s case, the company explicitly outlines that if it goes bankrupt or is sold to another company, all of its privacy protections may be waived: “If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer.”\n\nIt is notable that the company’s only remedy for those who don’t want their data sold is to delete their account prior to the sale.",
  "It seems that even a company that has built its business on the idea of ads being evil and positioned itself as a responsible and ethical alternative is simply not willing to talk about what it does with the vast and extremely valuable mountains of user data it assembles on all of us or to eschew collecting that data in the first place and commit to deleting all user data on a rolling window that gives it only enough of a window to address security and billing needs.",
  "Of course, as Facebook reminded us earlier this month, the definition of “third party” is notoriously fuzzy in our modern surveillance society, with Facebook reclassifying many third party companies as extensions of itself, rather than external partners, to avoid violating key legal agreements governing what it could share with outside entities.",
  "Medium’s founder Evan Williams famously positioned the platform as the answer to the “the broken system [of] ad-driven media on the internet.” In his view, the ad-supported web is built to the needs of advertisers, favoring content that garners views rather than conveys insights and encourages vapid virality over thoughtful enlightenment.",
  "This is a critical distinction, as the current terms of service would appear to permit Medium to provide your personal data to data brokers and other for-profit commercial entities so long as Medium does not receive monetary benefit for the transfer by “selling” the data rather than bartering it for something else.",
  "More to the point, it is also a reminder that companies, especially startups, are bought and sold everyday and that when a company’s ownership changes hands, all of those privacy guarantees about protecting your data and not selling your most intimate information to the highest bidder are moot.",
  "For example, receiving free web analytics services from third parties by permitting them to see all of its web traffic and profile its users would be explicitly permitted under Medium’s terms of service and indeed the company does use at least one third party tracking service on its site.",
  "It is particularly troubling that Medium uses the language “academic or non-profit researchers” instead of “strictly non-commercial research.”\n\nThis is a critical distinction that is lost on many in Silicon Valley who lack experience with the administrative aspects of academic research.",
  "Universities with large engineering colleges and especially those with competitive computer science departments typically have large amounts of commercially funded research in which private companies provide funding to the university to conduct research of interest to that company.",
  "Medium can also provide the data to any third-party company or academic or non-profit researchers it pleases and researchers could even spin it into a company or provide it back to a company without additional contractual restrictions that Medium would have to impose separately.",
  "In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg both alluded to the notion of a paid subscription version of Facebook in which users could spend a bit of money for the privilege of not being bombarded with obnoxious advertisements.",
  "In some cases this commercially funded research is designed to permit a company to gain access to data and resources not otherwise available to commercial entities by using the university to conduct the research and provide the data and results back to the company.",
  "Instead of stating that Medium will not provide your data to third parties for any purpose, the company explicitly states that it will only not share your data for advertising purposes but grants itself the right to provide your data for any other purpose.",
  "Specifically, companies can rewrite their terms of service at any moment to remove their privacy protections and there is nothing you can do about it other than to delete your account prior to the change and hope that that allows you to exclude your data.",
  "In Medium’s case, both such scenarios are possible under Medium’s terms of use, offering a reminder of how important it is for companies to play devil’s advocate and consider and explicitly exclude the common ways in which their data could be misused.",
  "However, look a bit closer and it is highly unlikely that “ad free” would actually mean “surveillance free.” In reality the surveillance machine would continue on, but hidden in the shadows rather than announcing its presence in plain sight.",
  "Medium’s Privacy Policy, last updated May 25, 2018 details a wealth of information that the company tracks and retains about its users, including all of the usual behavioral indicators tracked by all major social media companies.",
  "Yet, the clarification that the company won’t provide data to third parties for the explicit purpose of “providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you” while not excluding any other kind of data transfer is concerning.",
  "Putting this all together, at the end of the day all we know for certain is that Medium’s terms of service states that it tracks all of the same behavioral and account indicators that all the other social media companies record.",
  "A faculty member conducting federally funded academic research using data that is restricted to university use only can build computer models and training datasets using that data and then commercialize them into a startup.",
  "The unacknowledged undertone of this so-called “paid Facebook” was the promise that somehow removing advertisements would also remove the surveillance machine behind them, granting paying users the ultimate luxury: privacy.",
  "After all, as Verizon taught us, simply paying a subscription fee and having no ads doesn’t mean that a company won’t make a profit reselling your most intimate and private data on the side to make even more money.",
  "The company’s terms of service permit it to make all of that data available to anyone it pleases so long as it doesn’t sell the data and doesn’t provide it to a company for the stated purpose of advertisement.",
  "In many ways Medium is a real-life example of precisely the kind of ad-free subscription-supported citizen social content platform that Sandberg and Zuckerberg had alluded to as a possibility for Facebook.",
  "Most US universities permit academic research that is funded by commercial entities, while the Bayh-Dole Act also provides for the commercialization of academic research that is purely federally funded.",
  "Of course, Medium did offer ads, but subsequently pivoted to a subscription model in which users willing to pay a small monthly fee would get unlimited access to articles and exclusive premium content.",
  "The company takes great pains to state that \"Medium won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you.",
  "Yet even those sites like Medium that have built their businesses on ads being evil and use a free plus subscription model offer few details on what they do with their users’ data.",
  "In other cases, even federally funded research can lead to the commercialization of data that is traditionally banned from commercial use, through faculty startups.",
  "This view is so central to the very existence of Medium that its about page describes the platform in terms of a crossed out list of advertising related terms.",
  "Indeed, this happens routinely in academia and poses unique challenges to traditional norms of licensing, copyright and intellectual property ownership.",
  "In other words, terms of service are living documents that can be changed at any moment and the few privacy protections they offer are not binding.",
  "While we don’t typically think about prominent Silicon Valley companies failing, that is always a possibility.",
  "It is also notable that Medium explicitly extends a blanket opening for academic and non-profit research.",
  "This raises the question, does the lack of ads mean that Medium does not track its users in any way?",
  "In the end we simply have no idea as the company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
  "It seems the ad-free subscription model is not the route to privacy and transparency after all.",
  "Finally, there is the question of what happens if Medium ever went bankrupt or was sold.",
  "Has Medium already shared user data and with how many companies or researchers?",
  "Medium is living proof that ad free does not mean surveillance free.",
  "This raises the question – what does Medium do with all this data?",
  "Clearly ad-free does not mean surveillance free.",
  "We won’t sell information about you.\""
