  "Speakers came from Apollo Global Management, PJT Partners, Susquehanna Financial Group, Point72 Academy, Rockbridge Growth Equity, Ariel Investments, Charles Schwab, FTI Consulting, Moelis, BlackRock, Miller Value Partners, Kirkland & Ellis, Lyrical Asset Management and Benzinga.",
  "We arrived at this price target through several valuation methodologies including a levered discounted cash flow analysis, a dividend discounted model and a net asset valuation based on Seritage’s balance sheet and a 6.5% assumed cap rate.",
  "At this moment, Seritage Growth Properties (SRG) has entered into enough long-term lease agreements with diversified tenants to gradually mitigate the market’s concern about Seritage's revenue concentration in Sears.",
  "However, because the lease contracts on the existing redevelopment pipeline are already locked in with new tenants, we would see this lost rental income hit the income statement gradually over the next 12-months.",
  "Once revenue from the current redevelopment pipeline hits Seritage's income statement and if Sears survives through the end of 2018, fundamentals imply a high probability of a short squeeze on Seritage.",
  "This program helps fund scholarships for first-generation college students that come to the University of Florida and GSIF is very excited to partner with MFOS and give back to the community.",
  "Once tenants move into completed redevelopments and SRG sees this rent hit the income statement, speculators using Seritage to bet on a Sears default will be forced to buy back their shares.",
  "Because of near-term concerns, the market has not given SRG credit for this and we expect to see much of Seritage's intrinsic value unlocked as redevelopments diversify its tenant base.",
  "This would also lower interest coverage ratios in the near term slowing down the pace of funding future redevelopment projects for around a year until current projects are complete.",
  "Three students from the University of Florida did just that and they won a stock pitch competition at the Ross School of Business with their buy pitch on Seritage Growth Properties.",
  "Sears' bonds due in 2018 are priced to imply an 85% chance of Sears surviving through 2018 and the 2019 bonds are priced to imply a 67% chance of surviving through the end of 2019.",
  "The event was sponsored by Point72, Janus Henderson Investors, Capital Group, Susquehanna Financial Group, Telemus, BainCapital, the David Kudla Foundation and Morning Brew.",
  "This year, the club partnered with David Kudla from Mainstay Capital Management and they held the Engage Undergraduate Investment Conference from Oct. 20th to the 22nd.",
  "The market has established a massive short interest percentage on Seritage because Seritage provides a cheaper way to speculate on the timing of a Sears bankruptcy.",
  "If Sears went bankrupt before the completion of Seritage’s current redevelopment pipeline, investors would likely sell off Seritage due to the lost rental income.",
  "After completing announced redevelopments Seritage still has the ability to quadruple its rent revenue on over 75% of its properties at 12% return on investment.",
  "The economics of these redevelopments and revenue expansion from releasing mean, over the long run, SRG will generate significantly more cash than they do today.",
  "The ability to recapture, release and redevelop drives Seritage's ability to quadruple rent revenue over time while maintaining relatively flat overhead costs.",
  "The competition attracted 25 schools and the University of Florida, University of Texas at Austin and the University of Wisconsin made it into the final round.",
  "For investors with a longer holding period, Seritage offers an attractive return especially if the company trades down on any negative developments at Sears.",
  "Importantly, while we are enthusiastic about Seritage's return potential over the next 12 months, we love this company for its long-term prospects.",
  "Each year the Michigan Interactive Investments club at the University of Michigan hosts a stock pitch competition at the Ross School of Business.",
  "Sears continues to remain one of Seritage’s primary tenants and the market has a valid near-term concern about Seritage’s revenue concentration.",
  "The fund recently transitioned into an endowment structure to make annual pay-outs to the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars (MFOS) program.",
  "Kristen Mousa, David Stanley and Austin Goyer from the University of Florida won the competition and they took home the $3,000 grand prize.",
  "When a significant portion of the market is shorting a stock and hopes that it will drop, would you have the courage to pitch it as a buy?",
  "Seritage needs to finish its announced redevelopment projects before we will see any of contractual revenue hit the income statement.",
  "It was initially spun-off of from Sears back in 2015 in a transaction that was structured similarly to a sale-leaseback.",
  "We all are excited to see GSIF continue to grow in the future as we grow our fund size and payouts to the MFOS program.",
  "Sears faces liquidity issues and as a result, the market continues to sell Seritage due to its high exposure to Sears.",
  "Additionally, the bond market is giving us favorable odds that Sears will survive long to ensure a smooth transition.",
  "We are all members of the Gator Student Investment Fund (GSIF) which is a long-only equity student-managed portfolio.",
  "However, we see this as something Seritage could easily accomplish due to its low comparable debt per square feet.",
  "This will result in a short squeeze and a period of sustained buying as the current shorts cover their positions.",
  "It currently would take speculators over 50 days to cover all their positions at average daily trading volumes.",
  "An immediate Sears bankruptcy scenario may also force Seritage to raise additional debt to fund redevelopments.",
  "We have a $60 price target on Seritage which is an approximate 42% upside compared to where it trades today.",
  "No other equity REIT has over 75% of their real estate leased at (1/4) of the prevailing market rates.",
  "However, this short thesis will become increasingly invalid as Seritage diversifies its revenue base.",
  "The fund consists of roughly 45 members who are divided among 6 different industry sectors.",
  "Seritage is a real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of roughly 260 properties.",
  "The transaction gave SRG the ability to quadruple its rental revenue over time.",
  "We currently manage $500,000 in capital on behalf of the university endowment.",
  "Your school has a student managed fund, could you tell me more about it?",
  "The interaction between these three points drives our near-term thesis.",
  "Why do you like this stock more than some others in the same industry?",
  "We pitched a buy recommendation on Seritage Growth Properties.",
  "Our analysis shows this will happen towards the end of 2018.",
  "What stock did you pitch and what was your recommendation?",
  "Do you see any risks to your investment recommendation?",
  "Disclosure: Kai works at the Ross School of Business.",
  "What price target do you have and how did you get it?",
  "Seritage is uniquely positioned among its peers.",
  "and favorable redevelopment economics.",
  "What catalysts might move the stock?"
