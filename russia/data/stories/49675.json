  "Because some of the abuse cases that — that are very sensitive, like face recognition, for example — and I feel there's a balance that's extremely important to strike here, where you obtain special consent for sensitive features like face recognition, but don't — but we still need to make it so that American companies can innovate in those areas, or else we're going to fall behind Chinese competitors and others around the world who have different regimes for — for different new features like that.",
  "In addition to that, Facebook has initially shut down the Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day page, has blocked a post of a Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen Catholic pages, and most recently blocked Trump supporters Diamond and Silk's page, with 1.2 million Facebook followers, after determining their content and brand were, quote, “unsafe to the community.”\n\nTo a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias.",
  "So, for example, the messages that people send is something that we collect in order to operate the service, but in general, that data is not going to be shared with third parties, it is not connected to the broader Facebook ...\n\nDURBIN: Excuse me, as a lawyer, I picked up on that word “in general,” the phrase “in general.” It seems to suggest that in some circumstances it will be shared with third parties.",
  "First, I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and I — this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about.",
  "DURBIN: I think that may be what this is all about: your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy and how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, “connecting people around the world;” a question, basically, of what information Facebook's collecting, who they're sending it to and whether they ever asked me, in advance, my permission to do that.",
  "So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, “All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women,” then we might have some sense, because people shared skiing-related content, or said they were interested in that, they shared whether they're a woman, and then we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.",
  "So, one of the things that — that we've struggled with over time is to make something that is as simple as possible so people can understand it, as well as giving them controls in line in the product in the context of when they're trying to actually use them, taking into account that we don't expect that most people will want to go through and read a full legal document.",
  "That's why, every single time you go to share something on Facebook, whether it's a photo in Facebook, or a message — in Messenger or What's App, every single time, there's a control right there about who you're going to be sharing it with — whether it's your friends or public or a specific group — and you can — you can change that and control that in line.",
  "Or is he going along with what is a major trend in an information age, to try to harvest information for political forces?”\n\nAnd so my question to you is, do you see that those applications, that those companies — Palantir and even WhatsApp — are going to fall into the same situation that you've just fallen into, over the last several years?",
  "And I think that there is — there are moral and legal obligation questions that I think we'll have to wrestle with as a society about when we want to require companies to take action proactively on certain of those things, and when that gets in the way of ...\n\nCORNYN: I appreciate that, I have two minutes left ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: All right.",
  "So we took the step last week — that was a pretty big step for us — of taking down sanctioned news organizations in Russia as part of an operation to remove 270 fake accounts and pages, part of their broader network in Russia, that was — that was actually not targeting international interference as much as — sorry, let me correct that.",

  "But my question is, during the time that it was Facebook's mantra or motto to move fast and break things, do you think some of the misjudgments, perhaps mistakes that you've admitted to here, were as a result of that culture or that attitude, particularly as it regards to personal privacy of the information of your subscribers?",
  "And I just want to be clear, as we work to pass this law so that we have the same rules in place to disclose political ads and issue ads as we do for TV and radio, as well as disclaimers, that you're going to take early action, as soon as June I heard, before this election so that people can view these ads, including issue ads.",
  "So I know net neutrality has been a — a hotly debated topic, and one of the reasons why I have been out there saying that I think that should be the case is because, you know, I look at my own story of when I was getting started building Facebook at Harvard, you know, I only had one option for an ISP to use.",
  "The background on Messenger Kids is, we heard feedback from thousands of parents that they want to be able to stay in touch with their kids and call them, use apps like FaceTime when they're working late or not around and want to communicate with their kids, but they want to have complete control over that.",
  "Facebook collects massive amounts of data from consumers, including content, networks, contact lists, device information, location, and information from third parties, yet your data policy is only a few pages long and provides consumers with only a few examples of what is collected and how it might be used.",
  "DURBIN: They certainly know within the Facebook pages who their friends are, but they may not know as has happened — and you've conceded this point in the past, that sometimes that information is going way beyond there friends, and sometimes people have made money off of sharing that information, correct?",
  "And the fact that people like John Bolton, basically, was an investor — in a New York Times article earlier — I guess it was actually last month — that the Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp-wristed and spineless, and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues.",
  "I mean, they're going to keep on getting better at this, and we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this, too, which is why one of things I mentioned before is we're going to have more than 20,000 people, by the end of this year, working on security and content review across the company.",
  "And I think, in other areas, like the core part of what we do — right, if you — if you think about — just, at the most basic level, people come to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, about a hundred billion times a day to share a piece of content or a message with a specific set of people.",
  "And I think that that basic functionality people understand, because we have the controls in line every time, and given the volume of — of — of the activity, and the value that people tell us that they're getting from that, I think that that control in line does seem to be working fairly well.",
  "This needs — the stuff needs to be implemented in a way where people can actually understand it, where consumers can — can understand it, but that can also capture all the nuances of how these services work in a way that doesn't — that's not overly restrictive on — on providing the services.",
  "So the most important way that this happens across our services is that every day, people come to our services to choose to share photos or send messages, and every single time they choose to share something, there — they have a control right there about who they want to share it with.",

  "And the way I explain it to my constituents is that if someone breaks into my apartment with the crowbar and they take my stuff, it's just like if the manager gave them the keys or if they didn't have any locks on the doors, it's still a breach; it's still a break in.",
  "That's why every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our services and either post a photo or send a message to someone, because they know that they have that control and that who they say it's going to go to is going to be who sees the content.",
  "But, overall, the way we've enforced our platform policies in the past is we have looked at patterns of how apps have used our APIs and accessed information, as well as looked into reports that people have made to us about apps that might be doing sketchy things.",
  "When I saw you not too long after I entered the Senate in 2011, I told you, when I sent my business cards down to be printed, they came back from the Senate print shop with the message that it was the first business card they'd ever printed a Facebook address on.",

  "We've seen how foreign actors are abusing social media platforms like Facebook to interfere in elections and take millions of Americans' personal information without their knowledge in order to manipulate public opinion and target individual voters.",
  "Nevertheless, some have warned that the actions Facebook is taking to ensure that third parties do not obtain data from unsuspecting users, while necessary, will actually serve to enhance Facebook's own ability to market such data exclusively.",
  "So, when I look at Palantir and what they're doing; and I look at WhatsApp, which is another acquisition; and I look at where you are, from the 2011 consent decree, and where you are today; I am thinking, “Is this guy outfoxing the foxes?",
  "And that app offers people an option to sync their — their text messages into the messenging app, and to make it so that — so basically so you can have one app where it has both your texts and — and your Facebook messages in one place.",

  "The examples given emphasize benign uses, such as “connecting with friends,” but your policy does not give any indication for more controversial issues of such data.",
  "I'm concerned that press reports indicate Facebook learned about this breach in 2015, but appears not to have taken significant steps to address it until this year.",
  "But as I've said a number of times today, I think we need to take a broader view of our responsibility around privacy than just what is mandated in the current law.",
  "And while that wasn't a matter — the “move fast” cultural value is more tactical around whether engineers can ship things and — and different ways that we operate.",
  "Second is we're working with civil society in Myanmar to identify specific hate figures so we can take down their accounts, rather than specific pieces of content.",
  "One other thing: There have been reports that Facebook can track a user's Internet browsing activity, even after that user has logged off of the Facebook platform.",
  "The idea that for every person who decided to try an app, information about nearly 300 other people was scraped from your service is, to put it mildly, disturbing.",
  "And I know that, when we address these challenges we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: When we learned in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had bought data from an app developer on Facebook that people had shared it with, we did take action.",
  "Illinois has a Biometric Information Privacy Act, or the state does, which is to regulate the commercial use of facial, voice, finger and iris scans and the like.",
  "Would you be open to the idea that someone having reached adult age, having grown up with Messenger Kids, should be allowed to delete the data that you collected?",
  "Under paragraph number two, you say, “You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook.” That's what you've told us here today, a number of times.",
  "You have told us today — and you've told the world — that Facebook was deceived by Aleksandr Kogan when he sold user information to Cambridge Analytica, correct?",
  "CRUZ: Do you know, of those 15 to 20,000 people engaged in content review, how many, if any, have ever supported, financially, a Republican candidate for office?",
  "And, between those three elections, we were able to proactively remove tens of thousands of accounts that — before they — they could contribute significant harm.",
  "1.4 billion people use it every day; more than the population of any country on Earth except China, and more than four times the population of the United States.",
  "From that perspective, that's why we generally try to refer to what we do as platform for all ideas ...\n\nCRUZ: Let me try this, because the time is constrained.",
  "And they are based on legislation that I've offered, the MY DATA Act; legislation that Senator Markey is introducing today, the CONSENT Act, which I'm joining.",
  "And if I had to pay extra in order to make it so that my app could potentially be seen or used by other people, then — then we probably wouldn't be here today.",
  "Facebook created an app allowing kids between the ages of 6 and 12 to send video and text messages through Facebook as an extension of their parent's account.",
  "Facebook currently has over 2 billion monthly active users across the world, over 25,000 employees, and offices in 13 U.S. cities and various other countries.",
  "And a bill that we've just passed — it will be signed into law tomorrow — SESTA, the Stop Exploiting Sex Trafficking Act — was the result of our cooperation.",
  "We have to make sure those connections are positive.” It says, “We have to make sure people aren't using their voice to hurt people or spread misinformation.",
  "And let me agree with basically his — his advice, that we don't want to overregulate (inaudible) to the point where we're stifling innovation and investment.",
  "You've also estimated that roughly 126 people — million people may have been shown content from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency.",
  "So memo to the rest of you, we have to get this done or we're going to have a patchwork of ads, and I hope that you'll be working with us to pass this bill.",
  "But I think you and I agree, this is going to be one of the major items of debate if we have to go forward and — and do this from a governmental standpoint.",
  "What I'm asking about, in terms of what your subscribers understand, in terms of how their data is going to be used — but let me go to the terms of service.",
  "Today, Facebook has access of data points, ranging from ads that you've clicked on, events you've attended and your location, based upon your mobile device.",
  "As for past activity, I don't have all the examples of apps that we've banned here, but if you would like, I can have my team follow up with you after this.",
  "And if you make it long and spell out all the detail, then you're probably going to reduce the percent of people who read it and make it accessible to them.",
  "It has exposed that consumers may not fully understand or appreciate the extent to which their data is collected, protected, transferred, used and misused.",
  "We want to hear more, without delay, about what Facebook and other companies plan to do to take greater responsibility for what happens on their platforms.",
  "Are you a ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: Well ...\n\nCRUZ: ... First Amendment speaker expressing your views, or are you a neutral public forum allowing everyone to speak?",
  "CANTWELL: Well, I guess, given the track record — where Facebook is and why you're here today, I guess people would say that they didn't act boldly enough.",
  "So I think we can all agree that if you — when your kid is 6 or 7, even if they have access to a phone, you want to control everyone who they can contact.",
  "tools that can get into some of the nuances — the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate in flagging things for our systems.",
  "We expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber attacks, which we did identify and notify the campaigns that they were trying to hack into them.",
  "At the same time, these stories touch on the very foundation of the Internet economy and the way the websites that drive our Internet economy make money.",
  "WhatsApp collects very little information and, I — I think, is less likely to have the kind of issues because of the way that the service is architected.",
  "By the end of this year, by the way, we're going to have more than 20,000 people working on security and content review, working across all these things.",
  "And so, my reservation about your testimony today is that I don't see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road.",
  "If you looked at the comments on the internal discussion ...\n\nGRAHAM: Would you say ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: ... the vast majority of people internally did, too.",
  "But I want to make sure that I'm precise in my answer, so let me ...\n\nWICKER: When — well, when you get ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: ... follow up with you on that.",
  "GRASSLEY: I'll remind members that, maybe, weren't here when I had my opening comments that we are operating under the five-year — the five-minute rule.",
  "THUNE: You've promised that when Facebook discovers other apps that had access to large amounts of user data, you will ban them and tell those affected.",
  "Now, at a minimum, consumers must have the transparency necessary to make an informed decision about whether to share their data and how it can be used.",
  "What we know now is that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed some information about millions of Facebook members by buying it from an app developer.",
  "It is no secret that Facebook makes money off this data through advertising revenue, although many seem confused by or altogether unaware of this fact.",
  "But as you've said, this is not likely to be an isolated incident; a fact demonstrated by Facebook's suspension of another firm just this past weekend.",
  "CORNYN: How about third parties that you have contracted with to use some of that underlying information, perhaps to target advertising for themselves?",
  "A quiz app used by approximately 300,000 people led to information about 87 million Facebook users being obtained by the company Cambridge Analytica.",
  "That may not seem like a large group by Facebook standards ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... but it is significant here for a hearing in the United States Senate.",
  "NELSON: So, only now — and I appreciate our conversation — only now, Facebook has pledged to inform those consumers whose accounts were compromised.",
  "Here's the question that all of us got to answer: What do we tell our constituents, given what's happened here, why we should let you self-regulate?",
  "But we are committed to completing this full audit and getting to the bottom of what's going on here, so that way we can have more answers to this.",
  "So, now, we have to go through our — all of our relationship with people and make sure that we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.",
  "The tech industry has an obligation to respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy and security and to restore the public's trust.",
  "I'd like to remind the members of both committees that time limits will be and must be strictly enforced given the numbers that we have here today.",
  "And the fact that those 87 million people may have technically consented to making their data available doesn't make those people feel any better.",
  "This may be your first appearance before Congress, but it's not the first time that Facebook has faced tough questions about its privacy policies.",
  "I do think it's worth adding, though, that we're going to do the same verification of identity and location of admins who are running large pages.",
  "And why should we trust Facebook to make the necessary changes to ensure user privacy and give people a clearer picture of your privacy policies?",
  "More importantly, though, these events have ignited a larger discussion on consumers' expectations and the future of data privacy in our society.",
  "And, last week, we learned that number was even higher: 87 million Facebook users who had their private information taken without their consent.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I don't know when we changed it, but the mantra is currently move fast with stable infrastructure, which is a much less sexy mantra.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, what's happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEAHY: We all agree with that.",
  "The average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRAHAM: Okay.",
  "There are plenty of questions about the behavior of Cambridge Analytica and we expect to hold a future hearing on Cambridge and similar firms.",
  "When you discovered that Cambridge Analytica — that had fraudulently obtained all of this information, why didn't you inform those 87 million?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Mr. Chairman, I believe it's important to tell people exactly how the information that they share on Facebook is going to be used.",
  "What binds these two incidents is that they don't appear to be caused by the kind of negligence that allows typical data breaches to happen.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, there — the second category that I was going to talk about are ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRAHAM: I'm not talking about categories.",
  "You know, six months ago, I asked your general counsel about Facebook's role as a breeding ground for hate speech against Rohingya refugees.",
  "Do you agree now that Facebook and the other social media platforms are not neutral platforms, but bear some responsibility for the content?",
  "Facebook generates — generated $40 billion in revenue in 2017, with about 98 percent coming from advertising across Facebook and Instagram.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Overall, I would say that we're going through a broader philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibility as a company.",
  "Around privacy specifically, there are a few principles that I think it would be useful to — to discuss and potentially codified into law.",
  "And, if Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to — we, the Congress.",
  "BLUNT: The — so do you — you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree to what devices I may use, that you may have contact with?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, here's how we think about this: I don't believe that — there are certain content that clearly we do not allow, right?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I know that the — people use cookies on the Internet, and that you can probably correlate activity between — between sessions.",
  "BLUMENTHAL: Who in Facebook was responsible for seeing those terms of service that put you on notice that that information could be sold?",
  "What guarantees can you give us the note data from Messenger Kids is or will be collected or shared with those of might violate that law?",
  "And, in the present case, we recognize that Cambridge Analytica and an app developer lied to consumers and lied to you, lied to Facebook.",
  "You have a real opportunity this afternoon to lead the industry and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting individual privacy.",
  "Third, to prevent this from ever happening again, going forward, we're making sure that developers can't access as much information now.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we provided support to the Trump campaign similar to what we provide to any advertiser or campaign who asks for it.",
  "Actually, at — the first line of our Terms of Service say that you control and own the information and content that you put on Facebook.",
  "We took down the app, and we demanded that both the app developer and Cambridge Analytica delete and stop using any data that they had.",
  "Contrast that, for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we've actually been very successful at deploying A.I.",
  "If you knew in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica was using the information of Professor Kogan's, why didn't Facebook ban Cambridge in 2015?",
  "Do you consider yourself a neutral public forum, or are you engaged in political speech, which is your right under the First Amendment.",
  "Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum, and representatives of your company are giving conflicting answers on this?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator — I — I want to make sure I get this accurate, so it would probably be better to have my team follow up afterwards.",
  "Is it true that — as was recently publicized, that Facebook collects the call and text histories of its users that use Android phones?",
  "But what I would like to say today is that we're going to go forward and implement that, regardless of what the regulatory outcome is.",
  "DURBIN: I have three minutes left, so maybe you can do that for the record, because I have couple other questions I would like to ask.",
  "There may be some specific things about the device that you're using that Facebook needs to understand in order to offer the service.",
  "WICKER: And is that true for — is this practice done at all with minors, or do you make an exception there for persons aged 13 to 17?",
  "I — one of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, my — I can certainly have my team get back to you on any specifics there that I don't know, sitting here today.",
  "My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together.",
  "It will take some time to work through all the changes we need to make across the company, but I'm committed to getting this right.",
  "Have you determined when — whether any of those people were the same Facebook users who's data was shared with Cambridge Analytica?",
  "Now ...\n\nCRUZ: Let me — let me ask this question: Are you aware of any ad or page that has been taken down from Planned Parenthood?",
  "Now, you — you understand this better than I do, but maybe — maybe you can explain to me why that's that — why that's complicated.",
  "But the other really important piece is around verifying every single advertiser who's going to be running political or issue ads.",
  "It was primarily targeting — spreading misinformation in Russia itself, as well as certain Russian-speaking neighboring countries.",
  "And, again, I can make sure that our team follows up with you on anything about the specific past stats that would be interesting.",
  "As of this — early this year, you did not actively monitor whether that data was transferred by such developers to other parties.",
  "My question: Why doesn't Facebook disclose to its users all the ways that data might be used by Facebook and other third parties?",
  "Did any of these individuals ever stop to ask themselves why Facebook and Google didn't — don't change — don't charge for access?",
  "Although I know that we did help out the Trump campaign overall in sales support in the same way that we do with other companies.",
  "You earlier stated publicly and here that you would support some privacy rules so that everyone's playing by the same rules here.",
  "Instead they both appear to be the result of people exploiting the very tools that you created to manipulate users' information.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you created, the story that you've created represents the American Dream.",
  "SEN. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY (R-IOWA): The Committees on the Judiciary and Commerce, Science and Transportation will come to order.",
  "If you want something without having to pay money for it, you're going to have to pay for it in some other way, it seems to me.",
  "And I believe we need to have laws and rules that are sophisticated as the — the brilliant products that you've developed here.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Because they were very talented app developers who were making good use of our platform and understood our values.",
  "On January 30th, the Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood and lots of other child development organizations warned Facebook.",
  "CRUZ: So as CEO, have you ever made hiring or firing decisions based on political positions or what candidates they supported?",
  "tools that do a better job of identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation.",
  "Do consumers have the information they need to make an informed choice regarding whether or not to visit a particular website?",
  "How can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable information?",
  "Welcome to the committee, and, whatever your statement is orally — if you have a longer one, it'll be included in the record.",
  "As we get more free or extremely low-cost services, the trade-off for the American consumer is to provide more personal data.",
  "Whenever a controversy like this arises, there's always the danger that Congress's response will be to step and overregulate.",
  "But in general, a lot of the mistakes are around how people connect to each other, just because of the nature of the service.",
  "So hate speech is one of the hardest, because determining if something is hate speech is very linguistically nuanced, right?",
  "And I believe that, over the coming years, once we fully work all these solutions through, people will see real differences.",
  "In order to do that, we believe that we need to offer a service that everyone can afford, and we're committed to doing that.",
  "In your view, what sorts of legislative changes would help to solve the problems the Cambridge Analytica story has revealed?",
  "Through this 37-page indictment, we learned that the IRA ran a coordinated campaign through 470 Facebook accounts and pages.",
  "As I mentioned previously, his company now has over $40 billion of annual revenue and over 2 billion, monthly, active users.",
  "And that goes for fake news, for foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.",
  "We have a responsibility, not just to build tools, to make sure those tools are used for good.”\n\nMr. Zuckerberg, do you feel",
  "And I laid that out earlier when I talked about what ...\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Would you agree to an opt-in as opposed to an opt-out?",
  "Now on the subject of Cambridge Analytica, were these people, the 87 million people, users, concentrated in certain states?",
  "I understand with regard to suggested rules or suggested legislation, there are at least two schools of thought out there.",
  "And maybe we can go through largely just even “yes” and “no” and then we'll get back to more expansive discussion of this.",
  "But, more importantly, we try to provide in-line controls so that — that are in plain English, that people can understand.",
  "This includes the basic responsibility of protecting people's information, which we failed to do with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Some have professed themselves shocked — shocked that companies like Facebook and Google share user data with advertisers.",
  "I think what Sheryl was saying was that, in order to not run ads at all, we would still need some sort of business model.",
  "And how do you intend to proactively stop harmful conduct instead of being forced to respond to it months or years later?",
  "BLUMENTHAL: All of the information that you collect as a result of purchases from data brokers, as well as tracking them?",
  "Or am I able to, one at a — individually say what I'm willing for you to — to watch, and what I don't want you to watch?",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nDURBIN: If you messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged?",
  "So are — is that to suggest that the consent that people give subject to that terms of service is not informed consent?",
  "So data privacy and foreign interference in elections are certainly topics that we have discussed at the board meeting.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: But I think that there are different ways that we can communicate that, and have a responsibility to do so.",
  "Which is ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: ... ranging from texting apps, to email, to ...\n\nGRAHAM: ... is the same service you provide?",
  "And so it's my pleasure to recognize the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Chairman Thune, for his opening statement.",
  "If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore.",
  "Cambridge Analytica then took this data and created a psychological warfare tool to influence United States elections.",
  "These are some of the biggest issues that the company has faced, and we feel a huge responsibility to get these right.",
  "One is we're hiring dozens of more Burmese-language content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific.",
  "It's hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, senator, we try to run our company in a way where people can express different opinions internally.",
  "You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical obligation to have reported this violation of the FTC consent decree.",
  "But their use over the past years, across the political spectrum, and their increased significance cannot be ignored.",
  "Just recently, we've seen the “Me Too” movement and the March for our Lives organized, at least in part, on Facebook.",
  "This hearing is an opportunity to speak to those who believe in Facebook and those who are deeply skeptical about it.",
  "And, if we find that someone improperly used data, we're going to ban them from Facebook and tell everyone affected.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, along with his wife, also established the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to further philanthropy causes.",
  "CORNYN: And — but you concede that — you doubt everybody reads or understands that legalese, those terms of service.",
  "You have cartoonlike stickers, and other features designed to appeal to little kids — first-graders, kindergartners.",
  "KLOBUCHAR: Okay, because as we know, that election was close, and it was only thousands of votes in certain states.",
  "How can you dedicate, and will you dedicate, resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down within 24 hours?",
  "Right now I am not convinced that Facebook's users have the information that they need to make meaningful choices.",
  "If we find that they're doing anything improper, we'll ban them from Facebook and we will tell everyone affected.",
  "They look a lot like the anonymous groups that Russian agents used to spread propaganda during the 2016 election.",
  "I just think part of this was when people don't even know that their data's been breached, that's a huge problem.",
  "One are the other tech platforms — so Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft — we overlap with them in different ways.",
  "What we found is that even though some people don't like ads, people really don't like ads that aren't relevant.",
  "Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to make sure that they're used for good.",
  "If so, how many times has that happened, and was Facebook only made aware of that transfer by some third party?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think that there are a few categories of legislation that — that make sense to consider.",
  "And I just want to take a moment before I go into this in more detail to thank you for your leadership on this.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, I — I assume Facebook's been served with subpoenas from the — Special Counsel Mueller's office.",
  "GRAHAM: Do you — do you agree with me that you better come up with different ways, because this ain't working?",
  "CRUZ: In your testimony, you say that you have 15,000 to 20,000 people working on security and content review.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: What we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement.",
  "And I think we should have our team follow up with — with yours to — to discuss the details around that more.",
  "I think in general, the expectations that people have of the pipes are somewhat different from the platforms.",
  "So, at the end of the day, this is going to be something where people will measure us by our results on this.",
  "GRASSLEY: Okay but, right now, you have no certainty of whether or not — how much of that's going on, right?",
  "It's hard to say that people fully understand something when it's only written out in a long legal document.",
  "And I think that that control is something that's important that I think should apply to — to every service.",
  "I'll place for the record — I want to know what you will do about Chinese censorship, when they come to you.",
  "I haven't printed that on my card yet, I — I will — will say that, but I think we have that account as well.",
  "There are days when I've regretted that, but more days when we get lots of information that we need to get.",
  "We have — Facebook has participated recently in the fight against scourge — the scourge of sex trafficking.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: That is a specific personnel matter that seems like it would be inappropriate to speak to here.",
  "LEAHY: Senator Cruz and I sent a letter to Apple, asking what they're going to do about Chinese censorship.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Sorry, are you — are you asking if Cambridge Analytica's data — data could be stored in Russia?",
  "One is around having a simple and practical set of — of ways that you explain what you are doing with data.",
  "After the 2016 election, our top priority was protecting the integrity of other elections around the world.",
  "It is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and to bring the world closer together.",
  "Do users understand what they're agreeing to — to when they access a website or agree to terms of service?",
  "Moreover, your policies only prohibit transfers by developers to parties seeking to profit from such data.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, people have a control over how their information is used in ads in the product today.",
  "Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I.",
  "NELSON: But — so, therefore, you consider my personally identifiable data the company's data, not my data.",
  "First, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, and telling everyone affected.",
  "If they make a defective car, it gets out in the world, people stop buying that car; they buy another one.",
  "And what are the applications and interests that are being discussed without putting real teeth into this?",
  "Do you know the political orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000 people engaging engaged in content review?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I'm not specifically aware of those ...\n\nCRUZ: How about any Democratic candidate for office?",
  "In the future, we're going to have tools that are going to be able to identify more types of bad content.",
  "Recently, U.N. investigators blamed Facebook for playing a role in inciting possible genocide in Myanmar.",
  "And, as context, Boz wrote that — Boz is what we call him internally — he wrote that as an internal note.",
  "Consumers ought to have clearer information, not opaque policies and complex click-through consent pages.",
  "It's even more extraordinary to have a single CEO testify before nearly half of the United States Senate.",
  "tools that can identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team at Facebook.",
  "CANTWELL: During the 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump campaign to refine tactics.",
  "We welcome everyone to today's hearing on Facebook's social media privacy and the use and abuse of data.",
  "One reason that so many people are worried about this incident is what it says about how Facebook works.",
  "But there's more to do, and you can find more details on the steps we're taking in my written statement.",
  "And we look forward to passing this bill — we'd love to pass it before the election — on the honest ads.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?",
  "BLUMENTHAL: I have a number of other specific requests that you agree to support as part of legislation.",
  "CRUZ: You just made a specific representation, that you didn't make decisions based on political views.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, my understanding is that that is how the mobile operating systems are architected.",
  "And the — the information, obviously, is an important commodity and it's what makes your business work.",
  "One is we try to be exhaustive in the legal documents, or on the terms of service and privacy policies.",
  "Because, if he had understood where you — where you were at, he would have never said it to begin with.",
  "The Judiciary Committee will hold a separate hearing exploring Cambridge and other data privacy issues.",
  "Do you think Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica, as press reports are saying, how to do these tactics?",
  "It's because, as of the time that we learned about their activity in 2015, they weren't an advertiser.",
  "You — you have to affirmatively say that you want to sync that information before we get access to it.",
  "I am not that familiar with the specific legal language of the — the law that you — that you speak to.",
  "But the broadest mistakes that we made here are not taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.",
  "My point is that one way to regulate a company is through competition, through government regulation.",
  "So, from the beginning of the company in 2004 — I started in my dorm room; it was me and my roommate.",
  "But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well.",
  "Plus, roughly 45 percent of American adults report getting at least some of their news from Facebook.",
  "From the moment that we wake up in the morning, until we go to bed, we're on those handheld tablets.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, what is Facebook doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections?",
  "BLUNT: So do people — do people now give you permission to track specific devices in their contract?",
  "We had indicated earlier on that we would take a couple of breaks, give our witness an opportunity.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have an app called Messenger for sending messages to your Facebook friends.",
  "LEAHY: But U.N. investigators have blamed you — blamed Facebook for playing a role in the genocide.",
  "And we talked a little bit earlier around the complexity of laying out these long privacy policies.",
  "A significant amount of that data is shared with third-party developers, who utilize your platform.",
  "And, every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most.",
  "But for this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know the stakes that are involved.",
  "We need to make sure that people aren't using it to harm other people or to spread misinformation.",
  "So here are a few things that we are doing to address this and to prevent it from happening again.",
  "HATCH: Well, if so, how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I think the Internet is increasingly ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRAHAM: You embrace regulation?",
  "We do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they're joining the company.",
  "GRAHAM: ... that you did a poor job, as a CEO, communicating your displeasure with such thoughts?",
  "Would you support a rule that would require you to notify your users of a breach within 72 hours?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I do not have that information with me, but we can follow up with your — your office.",
  "I realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for Facebook and our community.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.",
  "Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here.",
  "Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that, as long as I am running Facebook.",
  "I'll speak to hate speech, and then I'll talk about enforcing our content policies more broadly.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: No, senator, for the same reason — that we'd considered it a closed — a closed case.",
  "So would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry?",
  "Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity, anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community.",
  "That's a very fundamental part of how our model works and something that is often misunderstood.",
  "And you'll note that the Face — the FTC order specifically requires Facebook to protect privacy.",
  "It was heedless and reckless, which, in fact, amounted to a violation of the FTC consent decree.",
  "And I'm afraid Facebook has come down to the position of trying to carve out exceptions to that.",
  "So I think it's certainly worth discussing whether we should have something similar in the U.S.",
  "And I'm happy to have my team follow up with you on more information, if that would be helpful.",
  "And these great websites that don't charge for access — they extract value in some other way.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Mr. Chairman, I will have my team follow up with you on what information we have.",
  "Our witness today is Mark Zuckerberg, founder, chairman, chief executive officer of Facebook.",
  "The potential for further growth and innovation based on collection of data is unlimitedless.",
  "It has also been reported that he sold this data to Cambridge Analytica for $800,000 dollars.",
  "You lead a big company with 27,000 employees, and we very much look forward to your comments.",
  "It's not that I expect anything that I say here today — to necessarily change people's view.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I don't know that our employees were involved with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Or is that a recent addition to how you deal with those other ways that I might communicate?",
  "In other words, they may not read it, and even if they read it, they may not understand it?",
  "The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.",
  "LEAHY: ... it's a fight that's been going on for some time, so I might say it's about time.",
  "And Senator Warner and I have also called on Google and the other platforms to do the same.",
  "We need to make sure that the developers they share it with protect their information, too.",
  "I know Facebook has taken several steps, and intends to take more, to address these issues.",
  "And more than 70 million businesses — small business use Facebook to create jobs and grow.",
  "Like their expanding user base, the data collected on Facebook users has also skyrocketed.",
  "And online companies like Facebook are tracking our activities and collecting information.",
  "CANTWELL: So they may have been involved and all working together during that time period?",
  "Why'd you wait another ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nZUCKERBERG: Senator, that's a — a great question.",
  "Are you actually considering having Facebook users pay for you not to use the information?",
  "The app collects a minimum amount of information that is necessary to operate the service.",
  "Is that all in this document that I would see and agree to before I entered into Facebook?",
  "BLUMENTHAL: Would you agree that users should be able to access all of their information?",
  "My question is going to be, sort of, a follow-up on what Senator Hatch was talking about.",
  "THUNE: And — and, Mr. Zuckerberg, would you that — do that differently today, presumably?",
  "And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million Facebook users?",
  "And there's nothing wrong with that, as long as they're upfront about what they're doing.",
  "We have learned over the past few months, and we've learned a great deal that's alarming.",
  "When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had deleted the data.",
  "And that's appropriate, but it's unlikely to be enough for the 2 billion Facebook users.",
  "To the specifics about those apps, I'm not really that familiar with what Palantir does.",
  "I know in — up until 2014, a mantra or motto of Facebook was move fast and break things.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: All right, senator, so a number of things I think are — are important here.",
  "LEAHY: Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the Special Counsel's Office?",
  "After Hurricane Harvey, people came together to raise more than $20 million for relief.",
  "For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do.",
  "Are websites upfront about how they extract value from users, or do they hide the ball?",
  "Although to be clear, we don't offer an option today for people to pay to not show ads.",
  "Have you ever required an audit to ensure the deletion of improperly transferred data?",
  "And, now, we discover yet another incidence where the data was failed to be protected.",
  "But, until we get it more automated, there is a higher error rate than I'm happy with.",
  "We are listening, America is listening and quite possibly the world is listening, too.",
  "And I think we might have to take that for the record, based on everybody else's time.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I just think we have a broader responsibility than what the law requires.",
  "So I — what you ...\n\nCORNYN: No, I'm talking — I'm talking about — I appreciate that.",
  "WICKER: Unless you — unless you opt in, you don't collect that call and text history?",
  "We believe that we're going to be investigating many apps, tens of thousands of apps.",
  "After more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today's apology different?",
  "Now, Mr. Zuckerberg, I remember well your first visit to Capitol Hill, back in 2010.",
  "Overall, I — I do think that these issues around information access are challenging.",
  "We're here because of what you, Mr. Zuckerberg, have described as a breach of trust.",
  "The history and growth of Facebook mirrors that of many of our technological giants.",
  "Significant data collection is also occurring at Google, Twitter, Apple, and Amazon.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection.",
  "If I'm upset with Facebook, what's the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?",
  "Your business model is to monetize user information to maximize profit over privacy.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, senator, our goal is certainly not to engage in political speech.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, I can — I can commit that it was not because of a political view.",
  "There — there may be some data that is necessary to provide the service that we do.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I don't think that the average person likely reads that whole document.",
  "And I also think we get to solutions faster when we get that information out there.",
  "KLOBUCHAR: Okay, that seems like a big deal as we look back at that last election.",
  "If I buy a Ford, and it doesn't work well, and I don't like it, I can buy a Chevy.",
  "My understanding is that — is not that this was a violation of the consent decree.",
  "I want to thank Chairman Thune for working with all of us on scheduling a hearing.",
  "So this hearing is important, and I appreciate the conversation we had yesterday.",
  "Hate speech — I am optimistic that, over a 5 to 10-year period, we will have A.I.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, senator, my position is not that there should be no regulation.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I don't have any specific knowledge that would suggest that.",
  "CANTWELL: Do you believe European regulations should be applied here in the U.S.?",
  "LEAHY: But, if you decided this policy a week ago, you'd be able to verify them?",
  "So I think what we'll do is ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nZUCKERBERG: You can do a few more.",
  "Founded by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004, Facebook has exploded over the past 14 years.",
  "It's also more than 1,500 times the population of my home state of South Dakota.",
  "Questioning will alternate between majority and minority and between committees.",
  "Our policy towards data privacy and security must keep pace with these changes.",
  "The amount and type of data obtained, however, has seen a very dramatic change.",
  "In addition, their concerns about data that is being gathered about these kids.",
  "I just want to make clear that you have been contacted, you have had subpoenas.",
  "We also allow people the option of ...\n\nWICKER: You can opt in or out of that?",
  "We believe that it is entirely possible that there will be a connection there.",
  "In — in general, Facebook is not collecting data from other apps that you use.",
  "The FTC found that Facebook's privacy policies had deceived users in the past.",
  "If you're over your time, Chairman Thune and I will make sure to let you know.",
  "We will do our best to keep things moving efficiently given our circumstances.",
  "FEINSTEIN: Speak for a moment about automated bots that spread disinformation.",
  "So — actually, maybe, if — if you're okay with it, I'll go in the other order.",
  "So, when content gets flagged to us, we have those — those people look at it.",
  "And what is Facebook's responsibility to inform users about that information?",
  "So, since then, we — 2018 is — is an incredibly important year for elections.",
  "Cambridge Analytica wasn't using our services in 2015, as far as we can tell.",
  "But, certainly, I think that these are broad issues across the tech industry.",
  "To my — to my mind, these are questions that we should ask or be focusing on.",
  "Of course there will be the usual follow-up written questions for the record.",
  "It's not the first time that Facebook has mishandled its users' information.",
  "What are you doing to punish those who exploit your platform in that regard?",
  "But we were slow at identifying the type of — of new information operations.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I look forward to having my team work with you on this.",
  "I hope you'll fill me in on how that is consistent with protecting privacy.",
  "My question is whether you have all the will to help us solve this problem.",
  "Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, thank you both for holding this hearing.",
  "Professor Kogan is said to have taken data from over 70 million Americans.",
  "tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.",
  "Facebook handles extensive amounts of personal data for billions of users.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: ... and we should have followed up and done a full audit then.",
  "Do you think the average consumer understands what they're signing up for?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think that — that certainly makes sense to discuss.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas.",
  "CRUZ: Your testimony says, “It is not enough that we just connect people.",
  "If you delete your account, we should get rid of all of your information.",
  "So he'd want to be sure I mentioned him while I was here with — with you.",
  "There are days when I wonder if “Facebook friends” is a little misstated.",
  "In retrospect, it was clearly a mistake to believe them ...\n\nNELSON: Yes.",
  "Thank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take your questions.",
  "And what sorts of legislative changes would not help to solve this issue?",
  "CANTWELL: Do you think that Palantir has ever scraped data from Facebook?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, you're not allowed to have a fake account on Facebook.",
  "And that applies to those of us who are chairing the committee, as well.",
  "And — and I think that that's — that's a good level of control to offer.",
  "I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.",
  "About a month ago, we heard new reports that suggested that wasn't true.",
  "I think everyone should have control over how their information is used.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I am not familiar with those pieces of content specifically.",
  "LEAHY: Well, will you — will you find out the answer and get back to me?",
  "But I think for the quarter of the service, it actually is quite clear.",
  "And you also said here that you should have notified customers earlier.",
  "BLUMENTHAL: Well, what happened here was, in effect, willful blindness.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, our app review team would be responsible for that.",
  "And it's not enough to just give people control over their information.",
  "You spoke to the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, which I chair.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg launched Facebook February 4th, 2004, at the age of 19.",
  "Data has been used in advertising and political campaigns for decades.",
  "In many respects, Facebook's incredible reach is why we're here today.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do think that we made mistakes because of that.",
  "If they don't, we're going to take legal action against them to do so.",
  "This, I think, is an important area for the whole industry to move on.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, I think we all agree that what happened here was bad.",
  "But, you know, the — the platform you've created is really important.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, does Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: It was right around the time of the 2016 election itself.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: That's the only way that we can reach billions of people.",
  "That — in response to Senator Nelson's question ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: Yes.",
  "So — so we basically had to enforce our content policies reactively.",
  "The rules of the road have to be the result of congressional action.",
  "SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TEX): Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here.",
  "You have recently announced something that is called Messenger Kids.",
  "Had ...\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Has anyone been fired on that app review team?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, senator, I think, in certain areas, that is true.",
  "But these — these unverified, divisive pages are on Facebook today.",
  "technology that could look at the content that people were sharing.",
  "And all of a sudden I start receiving advertisements for chocolate.",
  "Now, that's been the experience that I've had, in my 42 years here.",
  "Data privacy should be tethered to consumer needs and expectations.",
  "Facebook has a responsibility to protect this personal information.",
  "So the effectiveness of these social media tactics can be debated.",
  "And you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer.",
  "When you sign up for Facebook, you sign up for a terms of service.",
  "GRAHAM: Do they do — do they provide the same service you provide?",
  "Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do generally agree with what you're saying.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I'm not — I'm not sure of the answer to that question.",
  "And, if they do, is that a relatively new addition to what you do?",
  "And we have letters — we've had contacts with Facebook employees.",
  "They have moved on from schools, likes and relationship statuses.",
  "We will proceed in order based on respective committee seniority.",
  "We have policies to try to make it as not subjective as possible.",
  "So I take it that — and I used the harmless example of chocolate.",
  "THUNE: Well — and I'm glad that you all have gotten that message.",
  "What if I don't want to receive those commercial advertisements?",
  "This is one of my top priorities in 2018 — is to get this right.",
  "We will anticipate a couple short breaks later in the afternoon.",
  "How will you inform users about the changes that you are making?",
  "You can't — do you — do you call back that information, as well?",
  "So I want to have my team follow up with you on that afterwards.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: So there are three categories that I would focus on.",
  "I believe that there may be, but I know we're working with them.",
  "Are you able to confirm whether they're Russian-created groups?",
  "SEN. RICHARD J. DURBIN (D-ILL): Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.",
  "GRASSLEY: Although not unprecedented, this is a unique hearing.",
  "DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",
  "THUNE: Thank you ...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRASSLEY: Senator Feinstein?",
  "I just want to make sure I get specifically what you're asking.",
  "FEINSTEIN: How many accounts of this type have you taken down?",
  "And that applies to ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... the five-minute rule.",
  "WICKER: Okay, well — but we're talking about privacy concerns.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I think the categories of — did you want just one?",
  "And, if somebody worked for me that said this, I'd fire them.",
  "GRAHAM: Have you ever submitted ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThat's true.",
  "But, when you look at terms of service, this is what you get.",
  "KLOBUCHAR: That's what he said this weekend on a Sunday show.",
  "And let me just say, we'll — we'll have to follow up on this.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, are you asking about those specifically?",
  "LEAHY: Have you been interviewed ...\n\nZUCKERBERG: I have not.",
  "And I apologize for interrupting you, but my time is limited.",
  "I hope that we can cooperate on this kind of measure as well.",
  "There was the U.S. Senate Alabama special election last year.",
  "CANTWELL: Some people refer to them as a Stanford Analytica.",
  "And the third point is — is just around enabling innovation.",
  "And I think we've been going, now, for just under two hours.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I think, if it's the right regulation, then yes.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Well, we provide a number of different services.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: In different ways — different parts of it, yes.",
  "And I'm looking forward to better disclosure this election.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I — I'm not familiar with those specific cases.",
  "BLUNT: Well, now, that doesn't seem that complicated to me.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I want to make sure we get this right.",
  "But do you collect user data through cross-device tracking?",
  "There's obviously a great deal of interest in this subject.",
  "And, at that time, he was a student at Harvard University.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, can you repeat the specific question?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not — I'm not sure, specifically.",
  "SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CONN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "I'm just trying to lay out how broadly I think about this.",
  "And one of the areas that I've focused on is the election.",
  "Is there an alternative to Facebook in the private sector?",
  "GRAHAM: Well, this is an opinion that really disturbs me.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nTHUNE: You — you're — you want to keep going?",
  "BLUMENTHAL: Well, here is my reservation, Mr. Zuckerberg.",
  "So I want to ask you a couple of very specific questions.",
  "We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world.",
  "They're issues and challenges for all of us as Americans.",
  "That in essence is what I understood Ms. Sandberg to say.",
  "So we have made a lot of mistakes in running the company.",
  "We have to make sure that those connections are positive.",
  "Each member will have five minutes to question witnesses.",
  "So we offer this control that — that you're referencing.",
  "I don't have the exact figure on how many times we have.",
  "Maybe that's something your investigation will find out.",
  "CANTWELL: Have you heard of Total Information Awareness?",
  "There will always be a version of Facebook that is free.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, let me say a few things about this.",
  "And my son Charlie, who's 13, is dedicated to Instagram.",
  "But I don't — I don't have that on — sitting here today.",
  "How do you disclose your collected — collection methods?",
  "Is that a fair thing for the user of Facebook to expect?",
  "GRAHAM: But — but you, as a company, welcome regulation?",
  "However, I wonder about some of the collection efforts.",
  "And, if it violates our policies, then we take it down.",
  "FEINSTEIN: I believe this is extraordinarily important.",
  "GRASSLEY: Thank you, my colleagues and Senator Nelson.",
  "You said back then that Facebook would always be free.",
  "SEN. MARIA CANTWELL (D-WASH): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "So that's something that I would want to follow up on.",
  "I would probably not choose to do that publicly, here.",
  "DURBIN: I'll close, because I just have a few seconds.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.",
  "I'm talking about, is there real competition you face?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: It overlaps with a portion of what we do.",
  "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MINN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "And there are three specific things that we're doing.",
  "NELSON: Yes, you did that, and you apologized for it.",
  "However, the potential for abuse is also significant.",
  "It's extraordinary to hold a joint committee hearing.",
  "This should be a wake-up call for the tech community.",
  "More than 2 billion people use Facebook every month.",
  "The second is around giving people complete control.",
  "My question, I'll place ...\n\nTHUNE: That'd be great.",
  "Now, Facebook is an edge provider on the other hand.",
  "SEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MISS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "I'm not sure I can give one, but can I give a bunch?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, this is an important question.",
  "We don't want to come back to this situation again.",
  "There's a Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.",
  "It doesn't seem like I have those every single day.",
  "FEINSTEIN: Explain what is better about the record.",
  "So, back in 2011, it was a settlement with the FTC.",
  "So there are — there are two ways that we do this.",
  "Now, there are certain limits of the law, we know.",
  "You have to start over and get a Facebook account.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have a lot of competitors.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we're investigating that now.",
  "I disagreed with it at the time that he wrote it.",
  "Would you submit to us some proposed regulations?",
  "And, Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being with us.",
  "But that level of control is extremely important.",
  "And I think the details around this matter a lot.",
  "Some problems lend themselves more easily to A.I.",
  "Many are incredibly inspired by what you've done.",
  "Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company.",
  "And I hope that will be the in the answers today.",
  "You told me that the company had failed to do so.",
  "We need to make sure that they're used for good.",
  "So that's a success in terms of rolling out A.I.",
  "FEINSTEIN: When did you identify new operations?",
  "But let me just ...\n\nCRUZ: How about moveon.org?",
  "But they bore no responsibility for the content.",
  "Because car companies face a lot of competition.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I think that they get things right.",
  "Let me just move on to another couple of items.",
  "SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "So I'm — I appreciate that you brought that up.",
  "Thank you for being here today, Mr. Zuckerberg.",
  "SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TEX): Thank you Mr. Chairman.",
  "So I would need to follow up with you on that.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I'll have my team get back to you.",
  "It calls for the death of a Muslim journalist.",
  "Are you able to figure out where they're from?",
  "BILL NELSON (D-FLA.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "We have 44 members between our two committees.",
  "And were Facebook employees involved in that?",
  "GRAHAM: You think the Europeans had it right?",
  "This is the type of content I'm referring to.",
  "So ...\n\nLEAHY: But you can't answer on these?",
  "And there was an app out there that did that.",
  "Have you seen these terms of service before?",
  "Can you confirm whether or not this is true?",
  "GRAHAM: You don't think you have a monopoly?",
  "GRAHAM: He said, “So we connect more people.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, that makes sense to me.",
  "And that is not a mistake that we will make.",
  "It's not the majority of people on Facebook.",
  "It's not enough to just give people a voice.",
  "But did Facebook watch over the operations?",
  "We want to know if it's going to be enough.",
  "But then, Facebook is pretty extraordinary.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not aware of that.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I have not heard that.",
  "There was the French presidential election.",
  "To my mind, the issue here is transparency.",
  "GRASSLEY: No, thank you, Senator Feinstein.",
  "GRAHAM: Is Twitter the same as what you do?",
  "I actually am not aware of — of a subpoena.",
  "Why couldn't it be removed within 24 hours?",
  "SEN. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM (R-S.C.): Thank you.",
  "BLUNT: Am I able to — am I able to opt out?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Actually, let me clarify that.",
  "And we're also going to do that for pages.",
  "You acknowledged it was a breach of trust.",
  "And that's where — what we're seeing here.",
  "In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.",
  "But, today, we're just not there on that.",
  "There will not be a second round as well.",
  "And, of course, all of us are part of it.",
  "I started Facebook when I was in college.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being here.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, not because of this.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do not know that.",
  "Are you able to make that determination?",
  "SEN. PATRICK J. LEAHY (D-VT): Thank you.",
  "I got that sense in conversing with you.",
  "I hope we can get to the bottom of this.",
  "Now, increasingly, we're developing A.I.",
  "But I'm committed to getting this right.",
  "NELSON: And that is your business model.",
  "It's not enough to just connect people.",
  "GRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Feinstein.",
  "Below is the transcript of the hearing.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: We are working on that now.",
  "Do you agree that that's a possibility?",
  "We have a lot of discussion internally.",
  "GRAHAM: It is a good business decision.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: I'm not specifically aware.",
  "And we do not sell data to advertisers.",
  "Do you — do you bundle that permission?",
  "CORNYN: Well I — and I appreciate that.",
  "We're now in a fulsome debate on that.",
  "Are you familiar with Andrew Bosworth?",
  "WICKER: Okay, do that — let's do that.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Mr. Chairman, yes we have.",
  "I believe deeply in what we are doing.",
  "systems flag before any human sees it.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: So we've deployed new A.I.",
  "So, Instagram — you bought Instagram.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: That is correct, senator.",
  "Or does that remain in their custody?",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Maybe — maybe 15 minutes.",
  "THUNE: Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.",
  "We've seen the apology tours before.",
  "CRUZ: Let me ask the question again.",
  "So we build this service to do that.",
  "GRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Graham.",
  "THUNE: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",
  "GRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Wicker.",
  "It's not enough to just build tools.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Mr. Chairman, thank you.",
  "NELSON: Did anybody notify the FTC?",
  "So a lot of this is still reactive.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do not know.",
  "Do you know what I'm talking about?",
  "We will then move onto questioning.",
  "We had a good discussion yesterday.",
  "BLUNT: Has it always been that way?",
  "Do you agree with that assessment?",
  "CRUZ: Why was Palmer Luckey fired?",
  "CORNYN: Well, you clearly rent it.",
  "And there has been genocide there.",
  "I believe you have all the talent.",
  "We're doing that around the world.",
  "And we just haven't done that yet.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: No, senator, I do not.",
  "[Follow Wednesday's updates here.]",
  "So we actually had nothing to ban.",
  "Your content has to be authentic.",
  "Today's hearing is extraordinary.",
  "How will you protect users' data?",
  "We've come a long way since then.",
  "THUNE: Thank you, Senator Cornyn.",
  "I think legislation is necessary.",
  "THUNE: Thank you, Senator Durbin.",
  "CORNYN: ... to ask you questions.",
  "CORNYN: Sounds much more boring.",
  "THUNE: Thank you, Senator Blunt.",
  "Mr. Zuckerberg, nice to see you.",
  "WICKER: And thank you very much.",
  "THUNE: Senator Graham's up next.",
  "): Thank you, Chairman Grassley.",
  "FEINSTEIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.",
  "ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we run ads.",
