  "“It’s an act of ideological warfare, and it’s far more worrying than anything that Cambridge Analytica has done, or is accused of doing.”\n\nSeveral conservative outlets have certainly experienced Facebook-related traffic decreases, but, short of testimony from Zuckerberg, there is no way to know for sure whether Facebook has intentionally gone after them for their politics.",
  "Political pages and partisan news pages, like other public pages, have experienced declines, but there are examples of declines across the political spectrum.”\n\nFacebook does not reveal the formula behind its algorithms, so it is impossible to know for sure what has actually led to different sites’ changes in fortune.",

  "Fox News has actually seen its interaction rate on Facebook — the rate at which users like, comment, share or otherwise interact with a post — go up in the past month, according to the analytics tracker CrowdTangle.",
  "… They make decisions about what people get to see.”\n\nNot revealing exactly how those decisions are made has allowed everyone to draw their own conclusion about why some sites have been hurt more than others.",

  "One editor at a conservative site said in an email that, while he does believe there is bias at Facebook, some less established sites may simply be getting punished based on poor quality.",

  "Patrick Brown, CEO of Liftable Media, which owns The Western Journal, says the amount of traffic his site receives from Facebook has been cut in half since the algorithm change.",

  "Add another item to Facebook’s growing list of headaches: Conservative publishers are complaining that the social media network has unfairly targeted their traffic.",
  "Brown, from The Western Journal, said that although he believes conservatives have been unfairly hurt by Facebook, he is not sure whether it was intentional.",
  "The Western Journal analysis, using data from the web tracking company SimilarWeb, compared traffic from Facebook for several sites in February to March.",
