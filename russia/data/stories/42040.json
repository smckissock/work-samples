  "In that respect, the most significant takeaway from Thursday’s actions may be that the treasury has effectively endorsed the indictment by Mueller’s team—which Trump has repeatedly publicly attacked—against these people and organizations for having “tampered with or altered information in order to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.”\n\nWill Trump continue to downplay or deny that the Russians interfered to help his campaign when his own administration has taken action to punish them for doing so?",
  "JOSE JORDAN/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration took one of its strongest actions against Russia yet, imposing sanctions on 19 Russian individuals and five organizations in response to interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as cyberattacks including last year’s “NotPetya” attack and previously undisclosed attempts to penetrate the U.S. power grid.",

  "Treasury on Thursday sanctioned two Russian government agencies—the domestic security service, the FSB, and the main military intelligence service, the GRU—as well as six GRU officials under the sanctions act for their cyber activities.",

  "The British government expelled 23 Russian diplomats on Wednesday but has, notably, not sanctioned any specific individuals or organizations in response to the attack.",

  "(For what it’s worth, this hasn’t prevented the heads of these agencies from traveling to Washington.)",
  "Obama’s sanctions have not been lifted, and more have been applied under other legislation.",
  "Well, yes, he probably will."
