  "It is against our policies for developers to share data without people’s\n\nconsent, so we immediately banned Kogan’s app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan\n\nand other entities he gave the data to, including Cambridge Analytica, formally certify that they\n\nhad deleted all improperly acquired data — which they ultimately did.",
  "We will\n\ncontinue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference, and\n\nwe will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,\n\nbut also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.",
  "In a copy of his opening statement released by the House committee, Zuckerberg stressed the positive components of his social network, but emphasizes he made some mistakes in allowing those tools to be used negatively, for which he said he takes full responsibility.",
  "You should be able to\n\nsign into apps and share your public information easily, but anything that\n\nmight also share other people’s information — like other posts in groups\n\nyou’re in or other people going to events you’re going to — will be much\n\nmore restricted.",
  "But while our primary focus was on traditional threats, we also saw some new behavior in the\n\nsummer of 2016 when APT28-related accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake\n\npersonas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists.",
  "What we\n\nfound was that bad actors had used coordinated networks of fake accounts to interfere in the\n\nelection: promoting or attacking specific candidates and causes, creating distrust in political\n\ninstitutions, or simply spreading confusion.",

  "We’re also working with\n\nthe U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office, which has jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica,\n\nas it completes its investigation into what happened.",
  "I’ve directed our teams to invest so much in security — on top of the other\n\ninvestments we’re making — that it will significantly impact our profitability\n\ngoing forward.",
  "Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a\n\nFacebook Page associated with the IRA at some point during that period.",

  "Your calendar should be able to show your friends’ birthdays, your maps should show where\n\nyour friends live, and your address book should show their pictures.",
  "We now serve\n\nmore than 2 billion people around the world, and every day, people use our services to stay\n\nconnected with the people that matter to them most.",
  "What We Are Doing\n\nThere’s no question that we should have spotted Russian interference earlier, and we’re working\n\nhard to make sure it doesn’t happen again.",
  "We also required developers to get approval from Facebook before they\n\ncould request any data beyond a user’s public profile, friend list, and email address.",
  "In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to\n\ndramatically limit the Facebook information apps could access.",
  "We need to make sure that developers like Kogan who got\n\naccess to a lot of information in the past can’t get access to as much information going\n\nforward.",
  "Last month, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge\n\nAnalytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified.",

  "Organizations\n\nlike the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we’ll keep improving\n\nour techniques to stay ahead.",
  "So now we have to go through every part of our relationship with people and make sure we’re\n\ntaking a broad enough view of our responsibility.",
  "We’re in the process of investigating every app that had access\n\nto a large amount of information before we locked down our platform in 2014.",

  "Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data\n\nand has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to investigate this.",
  "It’s not enough to give people control of their information, we have to\n\nmake sure developers they’ve given it to are protecting it too.",
  "And we organized “get out the vote” efforts that helped more than 2\n\nmillion people register to vote who might not have voted otherwise.",
  "At the same time, it’s also important not to lose sight of the more straightforward and larger\n\nways Facebook plays a role in elections.",
  "This included activity by a group called APT28, that the U.S.\n\ngovernment has publicly linked to Russian military intelligence services.",

  "Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to\n\ncontinue to secure our platform.",
  "It’s\n\nnot enough to just give people a voice, we have to make sure people aren’t using it to hurt people\n\nor spread misinformation.",
  "But there’s more we can do here to limit the information developers can access\n\nand put more safeguards in place to prevent abuse.",

  "This week we started showing everyone a list of the apps\n\nyou’ve used and an easy way to revoke their permissions to your data.",
  "For even greater political ads transparency, we have also built a tool that lets\n\nanyone see all of the ads a page is running.",
  "But I want to be clear about what our priority is: protecting our\n\ncommunity is more important than maximizing our profits.",

  "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.",
  "In 2016, people had billions of interactions and open discussions on Facebook that may never\n\nhave happened offline.",
  "There have been a number of\n\nimportant elections since then where these new tools have been successfully deployed.",
  "It will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I’m committed to\n\ngetting it right.",
  "To do this, we enabled\n\npeople to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.",
  "We’re reducing the data you give an app when you approve it to only your\n\nname, profile photo, and email address.",
  "Some of the pages we removed belong\n\nto Russian news organizations that we determined were controlled by the IRA.",
  "Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars organizing and advertising online to get\n\ntheir messages out further.",
  "In order to require verification for all of these pages and advertisers, we will hire\n\nthousands of more people.",
  "Our security team has been aware of traditional Russian cyber threats — like hacking and\n\nmalware — for years.",
  "Leading up to Election Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with\n\nseveral threats with ties to Russia.",
  "And we’ll also keep building tools to help more people make their\n\nvoices heard in the democratic process.",
  "What Happened\n\nIn 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social.",
  "That includes improving the way we protect people’s information and safeguard elections around\n\nthe world.",
  "These\n\nactions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from being able to access as much Facebook data\n\ntoday.",
  "But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as\n\nwell.",
  "And we also told everyone whose Facebook information may have\n\nbeen shared with Cambridge Analytica.",
  "We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we’re working hard to get\n\nbetter.",
  "We have disabled thousands of accounts tied to organized, financially motivated\n\nfake news spammers.",
  "“… it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.",

  "These investigations have been used to improve our\n\nautomated systems that find fake accounts.",
  "We’re removing developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their\n\napp in three months.",
