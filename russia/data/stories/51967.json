  "Concerns about Russia's suspected intervention in the U.S. political system burst into the open earlier this year when the DNC acknowledged that its systems were compromised, resulting in the theft of a raft of communications, including information that appeared to show that party officials favored now-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during her hotly contested primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.",
  "During a panel discussion featuring many of the nation's top intelligence officials, Comey declined to identify Russia, even though U.S. authorities have long suspected that Russian government operatives were the source of hacking attacks that breached the Democratic National Committee and more recently the voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois.",
  "(Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON â€” While careful not to formally name Russia, FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that the bureau is actively investigating whether a \"nation-state actor is messing'' with the U.S. electoral system.",
  "\"We know at least two states have been the subject of hacking already,'' Schiff said in an interview with USA TODAY's Capital Download, \"so the question is not whether they have the ability, only whether they have the will to do it.",

  "Earlier this week, California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, urged the Obama administration to \"call out Russia.''",
  "Right now, because they have paid so little price for the hack of the DNC and (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee), there's little to deter them.''",
  "\"It is something that we take very, very seriously,'' Comey said, adding that the bureau is working \"very hard to understand whether that is going on.''",
  "The breaches also prompted the FBI to issue a nationwide alert, urging states to conduct vulnerability scans of their own election systems.",
