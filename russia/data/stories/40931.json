  "While there are many unknowns about Betsy DeVos I'm going w/ 2 thumbs up, especially considering the alternatives @PoliticsK12 @caitlinzemma pic.twitter.com/bRtaUFWxFV — Michael Petrilli (@MichaelPetrilli) November 23, 2016\n\nBut teachers’ unions see her support of charter schools and vouchers as an affront to public education, something Randi Weingarten, the head of one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions, quickly made clear.",
  "While Betsy DeVos has served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, much of her work has been at the state level, and she will now have to, as Chalkbeat wrote, “operate within a complicated web of interests and priorities, including with education officials in states that did not support Trump.” Her ability to navigate Washington is largely untested.",
  "The lack of oversight has prompted concern from the Obama administration that some bad charters were being allowed to operate without improving or being forced to close.",
  "Civil-rights groups like the NAACP have also expressed concern that low-income children and children of color suffer when oversight is scaled back.",
  "DeVos’s selection as education secretary will please Republicans like Senator Lamar Alexander, who heads up the Senate’s education committee.",
  "According to Chalkbeat, DeVos’s family poured $1.45 million into an effort to prevent Michigan from adding oversight for charter schools.",
  "@randiweingarten calls DeVos the \"most ideological, anti-public education nominee\" since the start of the Ed Dpt.",
  "DeVos and her husband have been supporters of charter schools for decades and longtime opponents of regulation.",
  "DeVos, 58, is married to Dick DeVos, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the governorship in Michigan.",
  "And according to Chalkbeat, around 80 percent of the state’s charter schools are run by private companies.",
  "He is the former president of Amway, which his father co-founded, and of the Orlando Magic NBA team.",

  "Her brother, Erik Prince, founded Blackwater, the controversial security firm.",
  "The family has given to a number of conservative and Christian organizations.",
  "She’s politically active, but she doesn’t have a lot of political experience.",
  "Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.",
  "We want to hear what you think about this article.",
  "The reaction to her nomination is mixed.",
  "Expect deregulation to be a priority.",
  "That effort ultimately failed.",
