  "In testimony to the US Congress earlier this month, Zuckerberg said he was concerned over Cambridge’s approach, telling a hearing: “What we do need to understand is whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall, that will require a stronger action from us.”\n\nFacebook in 'PR crisis mode' over Cambridge Analytica scandal Read more\n\nBut in the newly published material, the university’s psychology research ethics committee says it found the Kogan proposal so “worrisome” that it took the “very rare” decision to reject the project.",
  "What his or her friends have disclosed is by default disclosed to ‘friends’ only, that is, with an expectation of confidence.”\n\n\n\nThe ethics panel member added: “Facebook is rather deceptive on this and creates the appearance of a cosy and confidential peer group environment, as a means of gulling users into disclosing private information that they then sell to advertisers, but this doesn’t make it right to an ethical researcher to follow their lead.”\n\nThe academic also likened Facebook to a contagion.",
  "The academic, whose name was redacted from the document, said: “Facebook’s privacy policy is not sufficient to address my concerns.”\n\nAppealing against the panel’s rejection, a letter believed to be written by Kogan pointed out that “users’ social network data is already downloaded and used without their direct consent by thousands of companies who develop apps for Facebook”.",
  "It added: “In fact, access to data by third parties for various purposes is fundamental to every app on Facebook; so users have already had their data downloaded and used by companies for private interest.”\n\nAnother panel member felt that information shared with Facebook friends should not be regarded as public data.",
  "A 2015 proposal by Aleksandr Kogan, a member of the university’s psychology department, involved the personal data from 250,000 Facebook users and their 54 million friends that he had already gleaned via a personality quiz app in a commercial project funded by SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.",
  "Separately, Kogan proposed an academic investigation on how Facebook likes are linked to “personality traits, socioeconomic status and physical environments”, according to an ethics application about the project released to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request.",
  "I would agree that my actions were inconsistent with the language of these documents, but that’s slightly different.”\n\nKogan collected Facebook data before the network changed its terms of service in 2014 to stop developers harvesting data via apps.",
  "In an email to Guardian he added: “We were in the process of resubmitting a new application to the university having addressed these issues – a process that was ultimately stopped once Facebook asked us to delete all of the data.”",
  "A Cambridge University ethics panel rejected research by the academic at the centre of the Facebook data harvesting scandal over the social network’s “deceptive” approach to its users privacy, newly released documents reveal.",
  "But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.”\n\nKogan said the ethics committee raised a “number of issues” when it rejected his proposal.",
  "Explaining the decision, one member of the panel said the Facebook users involved had not given sufficient consent to allow the research to be conducted, or given a chance to withdraw from the project.",
  "In an initial statement on Kogan’s research, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had already taken key steps to secure users’ data and said it would go further to prevent abuse.",
  "The documents shed new light on suggestions from the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, that the university’s controls on research did not meet Facebook’s own standards.",
  "I should have got better advice on what is and isn’t appropriate.”\n\nBut asked if he accepted that he broke Facebook’s terms and conditions, Kogan said: “I do not.",
  "An ethical approach to using social networking data has to take account of this.”\n\nKogan accepted that he made mistakes in how the Facebook data was collected.",
  "In a response to Kogan’s appeal, the academic said: “Once you have persuaded someone to run your Facebook app, you can really only collect that subject’s data.",
  "Facebook has banned Kogan from the network and insisted that he violated its platform policy by transferring data his app collected to Cambridge Analytica.",
  "The letter sent in July 2015 said: “My view of Facebook is that it’s a bit like an infectious disease; you end up catching what your friends have.",
  "In written and oral evidence to the committee Kogan insisted that all his academic work was reviewed and approved by the university (pdf).",
  "Correspondence around the decision was released hours before Kogan appeared before a Commons inquiry into fake news and misinformation.",
  "But he did not mention to the MPs the ethics committee’s rejection of his proposed research using the Facebook data in May 2015.",
  "If there are bad apps, or malware, or even dodgy marketing offers, they get passed along through friendship networks.",
  "The panel said Facebook’s approach to consent “falls far below the ethical expectations of the university”.",
  "He told Tuesday’s committee hearing: “Fundamentally I made a mistake, by not being critical about this.",
  "The company has previously said it is “strongly committed to protecting people’s information”.",
  "He added: “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook."
