  "Your photo gallery offers a staggering amount of insight: as the CEO of Pixoneye wrote in an op-ed last year: “Our smartphone image galleries have in many ways become a reflection of our lives … each image you have stored contains a range of data attributes and meta tags that not only reveal your past purchasing profile, but can also be the key to predicting what purchases you’re likely to make in the future.”\n\nSo, you might be thinking, an app knows I like wine, and uses that information to sell me stuff.",
  "This issue isn’t just about one platform like Facebook, and the issues of surveillance and experimentation on the public, it’s about the many companies that are tracking and profiling us, and the abuses of power that come from having vast troves of information about us, available for exploitation.”\n\nOther data experts echo Noble’s view.",
  "In fact, it is the only version of the internet that some know, and it plays a central role in communicating, creating community and participating in society online.”\n\nEven if you’ve got multiple ways to communicate and participate in society online, there is not really a good replacement for Facebook.",
  "Back in 2004, when a 19-year-old Zuckerberg had just started building Facebook, he sent his Harvard friends a series of instant messages in which he marvelled at the fact that 4,000 people had volunteered their personal information to his nascent social network.",
  "'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine Read more\n\nWhile some Facebook executives were busy defending their honour on Twitter over the weekend, it should be noted that Zuckerberg remained deafeningly silent.",
  "My uneasiness with the network largely stems from the fact that I used to work in advertising and, for years, was on the receiving end of many a sales pitch from Facebook, Google and other companies that have built businesses trading in users’ data.",
  "Jim Killock, from Open Rights Group, an organisation that works to protect the right to privacy online, suggests “posting less, sharing less and, most importantly, removing page ‘likes’ as these are a major way [Facebook tries] to profile you”.",
  "While behemoths such as Facebook are guaranteed to make headlines, there’s a lot less media scrutiny of the thousands of other companies that make a living out of extracting and exploiting your personal life in extremely dubious ways.",
  "As Frederike Kaltheuner, who leads the data exploitation programme at the charity Privacy International, explains: “You can delete your Facebook, but you will still be tracked in your online and increasingly also your offline life.",
  "If you’re starting to feel jittery about the exploitation of your personal data but aren’t ready to delete social media and go and live off the grid, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate your digital footprint.",

  "As Safiya Noble, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Southern California and the author of Algorithms of Oppression, notes: “For many people, Facebook is an important gateway to the internet.",
  "The internet is increasingly a worldwide web of corporate surveillance and it’s impossible to piece together a complete picture of how your personal information – both your online and offline data – is being utilised.",
  "This is especially important in countries, such as the US, with no comprehensive data protection regime.”\n\nWhile the GDPR is an important step towards giving people control over their data, it’s far from a cure-all.",
  "Killock further suggests using “privacy plug-ins to block Facebook cookies, and cookies from other websites, which they all use to keep a record of the sites you visit, and making extra, ‘fake’ accounts”.",
  "“This means that if you are a company based outside the EU (for example in the US), and are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU, you must comply with it.",

  "Tracy Chou, a software engineer who has interned at Facebook and worked at a number of prominent Silicon Valley companies, agrees that there wasn’t a hack or breach of Facebook’s security.",
  "No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”\n\nIn a sense, Facebook’s defence to the Cambridge Analytica story was more damning than the story itself.",
  "What’s more, unless you delete Facebook’s entire ecosystem of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, you aren’t safeguarding yourself from the company’s data-collection practices.",

  "I think I’ve grown and learned a lot.”\n\nWhen it comes to respecting and safeguarding the information people have given him, however, has Zuckerberg really learned that much?",

  "The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are an important wakeup call that we are all living with the sociopolitical consequences of surveillance capitalism.",
  "It appears that while Facebook had been aware of what the Observer described as “unprecedented data harvesting” for two years, it did not notify the affected users.",
  "Deleting your Facebook account may not put an end to the surveillance state, but it sends an important message to big tech that we don’t trust them any longer.",
  "And it’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to big tech harvesting private information\n\nSorry to break it to you, but you are probably a “dumb fuck”.",
  "“People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation.",
  "However, if you’ve got an advertising budget and want to know how Facebook can persuade your target consumer to buy your product, it’s a different story.",
  "We are, I think, at a critical moment where the degree of corporate surveillance to which we are all subjected can either get much better, or much worse.",

  "Seeing years’ worth of data neatly arranged serves as an important wakeup call as to the extent of the information you have handed over to the company.",
  "Just look at China, where the government recently announced that it will ban people with poor “social credit” from travelling on planes and trains.",

  "But if you have granted an app permission to access your photos in the past, there’s a good chance you have allowed it to utilise Pixoneye’s tech.",
  "- video explainer\n\nWhat’s more, Facebook has displayed a remarkable lack of contrition in the immediate aftermath of the Observer’s revelations.",

  "Deleting Facebook inevitably means missing out on certain things and having to make more of an effort to connect with people in other ways.",
  "Bringing together multiple data sources is “how data-brokers have information such as personality profiles and relationship statuses”.",
  "“If you’re going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right?",
  "But Killock stresses that while it’s important that people are more cognisant of their online behaviour, “regulators must also act”.",
  "This is an important step in shifting the balance of power, when it comes to data, away from companies and back towards individuals.",

  "Deleting my Facebook account may have some way to protecting my sanity, but it has done little to minimise my digital footprint.",
