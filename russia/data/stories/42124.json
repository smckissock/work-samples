  "Companies also need to be specifically aware of three critical sanctions lists:\n\nThe Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) and the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) lists: No business can be done by US-compliant companies with the SDNs; non-US companies also run the risk of coming under secondary sanctions if they have at least a branch office in the US.",
  "This is a special form of due diligence in which a company is checked for CAATSA liabilities such as military contracts (many of these are unclassified), involvement in special oil projects – which can mean providing infrastructure or transportation services – or for subsidiaries based in Crimea.",
  "Nevertheless, several key blacklisted areas are clear: the law bans companies from working with the Russian defense/intelligence sector, in ‘special oil’ projects – deepwater exploration, Arctic oil, shale oil, on Russian export oil pipelines, and from any business involvement in Crimea.",
  "Another murky area is the possibility of the so-called daisy chain implementation, in which the principle of ‘six degrees of separation’ applies: a company working with a sanctioned entity can itself be sanctioned, exposing its own partners to the risk of sanctions in turn.",
  "However, unlike regular due diligence, this is to be done with a focus on OFAC: the question to be kept in mind is “would it be relevant to the US authorities?” Would OFAC see this blacklisting as advancing the sanctions’ goals, and the White House’s goals in general?",
  "Nevertheless, first takeaways have become clear, and so far they indicate that—unlike in the case of Iran—doing business in Russia or with Russian firms remains possible for multinationals, albeit with numerous caveats and a set of compliance measures.",
  "Sanctions are a long game by default, so the CAATSA is still settling in, and its main custodian, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), is far from establishing the full practice–and limits–of its implementation.",
  "The most glaring example is the defense/intelligence sector: CAATSA only bans ‘significant transactions’ with it, but neither the law nor OFAC have offered a clear explanation of what constitutes ‘significant’.",
  "This means a bigger risk for companies working in Russia, which have to do their homework to avoid the nasty shock of finding out that their seemingly safe partners have become overnight sanctions liabilities.",
  "The increasing knowledge around OFAC’s actions and focus gives multinationals the opportunity to continue their operations if they have a full understanding of where they might be vulnerable.",
  "This can be more complicated than it should be when the ownership chains contain entities from low-transparency jurisdictions (the British Virgin Islands are especially popular in Russia).",
  "By Alexey Eremenko\n\nAugust 2 marked the first anniversary of the cornerstone of the US’s sanctions against Russia, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).",
  "Understanding the red lines and gray areas\n\nIn contrast to the sanctions against Iran, in Russia’s case, there is no blanket ban to do business in Russia or with Russian entities.",
  "A less obvious but necessary step is checking for sanctions that risk exposure – in other words, whether counterparties can come under CAATSA-related sanctions in the future.",
  "Even more importantly, such due diligence on sanctions risks exposure can also identify the informal factors capable of influencing OFAC’s stance on a company or individual.",
  "A check of informal factors at play in sanctions risks exposure should also include analysis of the subject’s area of operations and its relevance for US economic policy.",
  "The SSI list includes top Russian state-owned companies such as Gazprom, Rosneft and Rostec, all of which continue to do business with companies from outside Russia.",
  "Risk mitigation always retains an element of uncertainty and unpredictability, especially in politically charged situations such as in US-Russia relations.",
  "Ownership verification is also a requirement: compliant businesses need to know whether their partners are ultimately controlled by sanctioned entities.",
  "The so-called \"Kremlin list\": Released in January 2018, this list names 94 of the richest Russian businessmen as potential targets for sanctions.",
  "Though the US has its fingers in many economic pies, some, such as metals and other blue-collar industries, are clearly hotter than others today.",
  "This includes examination of the subject’s reputation, political connections in Russia and corruption allegations against them.",
  "Six of them were sanctioned in April, which has understandably made businesses jittery about working with the remaining 88.",
  "To stay compliant, an obvious but crucial first step is verifying whether the company’s counteragents are on SDN/SSI lists.",
  "The principle, also known as 'secondary sanctions’, has not been applied yet, though the CAATSA is still finding its feet.",
  "This is also good practice for producers of equipment used in both civilian and military sectors, such as engine parts.",
  "However, in the case of the Russian SSI entries, the only prohibition is on lending them money for more than 14 days.",
  "The CAATSA offers a complex web of instructions and prohibitions, many of which are open to interpretation.",
  "Broadly speaking, foreign companies are strongly advised to stay away from these areas of activity.",
  "Alexey Eremenko is a Consultant for Compliance, Forensics and Intelligence at Control Risks.",
  "A related good practice is sanctions-checking the end users of the company’s products.",
  "This is nominally a straightforward task for in-house or outsourced compliance.",
  "But a compliant business operation in Russia remains possible.",
  "As usual, the devil is in the details.",
  "He is based in the Moscow office."
