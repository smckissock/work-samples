  "In a subtle hint to the fact that his political career is over, the 63-year-old Ivanov in the televised remarks on Friday thanked Putin for his \"high assessment of my work during the past 17 years.\"",
  "Ivanov was considered a likely successor to Putin before Putin chose Dmitry Medvedev to run for president in 2008 when he was unable to stand himself because of term limitations.",
  "Despite the clear appearance that Ivanov had been forced out, Putin insisted he was making the move at Ivanov's request because he had been too long in the job.",
  "Ivanov was also taken off the Security Council, Russia's top security body, which includes Putin, chairs of the parliament, and chiefs of security services.",
