  "Yet gone is the young, emaciated, caffeine-and-adrenaline-fueled lone wolf whose maxed-out credit card financed the purchase of basic recording devices at Best Buy; in his place is a muscular man who has gained 60 pounds thanks to relentless diet and exercise, who built Project Veritas into a sprawling, high-tech operation, and who last year raised more than $7 million from an expectant donor base that sees O’Keefe as a guerrilla leader on the front lines of America’s culture war.",
  "Furthermore, the rules of the undercover reporting game have become canonical in recent decades; chief among them, per the Society of Professional Journalists code of ethics, “Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public.” Unwritten but perhaps even more rigorously observed is the rule that journalists, undercover or not, cannot lie while doing their reporting.",
  "Project Veritas captured two of her allies — Scott Foval of Americans United for Change, and Robert Creamer, co-founder of Democracy Partners, a consultant to the Democratic National Committee, and husband of Illinois Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky — talking on video about tactics to help Clinton win, with Foval boasting about plans he and the “diabolical” Creamer had designed for everything from aiding voter fraud to stirring up violence at Trump rallies.",
  "An editorial from O’Keefe said the Centurion would not endorse George W. Bush or John Kerry for president; it also decried Bush’s attempt to pass a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, saying the policy bordered on “radicalism.” The second issue, in December 2004, carried a smart front-page story: 104 Rutgers professors had donated a combined $52,000 to Kerry, while just one professor had given $500 to Bush.",
  "At the end of his first semester at college, O’Keefe published a column titled “The Conservative Manifesto,” in which he wrote that “Rutgers promoted an intellectual imbalance” and declared, “I encourage gratuitous statements praising extremist left-wing tyrants, as long as there are statements praising extremist right-wing tyrants as well.”\n\nO’Keefe says his column was not renewed the next semester.",
  "The substance was intriguing if not explosive—one former employee touted the practice of “shadow-banning” accounts based on ideological content, while a higher-ranking current official admitted that employees peruse the erotic images exchanged by users—and yet the mere fact that O’Keefe’s outfit had infiltrated the social media giant was cause for celebration on the right.",
  "A four-man entourage was assembled in his suite: Matthew Tyrmand, a Project Veritas board member and adviser to Poland’s nationalist government; Nick Evangelista and Marco Bruno, O’Keefe’s communications aides; and Ryan Lopez, the Project Veritas documentarian, who always keeps a video camera trained on O’Keefe in public, including during some of our conversations.",
  "Brooke Kroeger, a professor at New York University’s graduate school of journalism and a supporter of undercover journalism, recalls how O’Keefe’s 2011 sting of National Public Radio—which resulted in the ouster of its CEO and another top official—came on the heels of a similar investigation, this one conducted by the Humane Society into Smithfield Foods.",
  "Reporters were content to dance on his grave, O’Keefe complained, rather than explore the connections between Landrieu’s family and the judge and the federal prosecutors in New Orleans, several of whom wound up later resigning in disgrace due to ethical lapses, including blogging negative remarks about O’Keefe and other defendants on a local news website.",
  "Some were proud Marxists; a few, he says, were self-described “Stalinists.” A contrarian by nature, O’Keefe applied for a biweekly column in the student newspaper, the Daily Targum, which he called “Feathers of Steel.” The commentary was benign at first but grew more confrontational the more unwelcome he felt in the newsroom and in his lecture halls.",
  "“Because,” he growled, “they fucking hate me.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the blockbuster stories of the past three presidential races—Trump boasting about groping women; Mitt Romney dismissing 47 percent of the electorate; Barack Obama observing that “bitter” voters cling to God and guns—were all the result of stealth recordings.",
  "A quick internet search turned up a GoFundMe page under her name in which she described moving to New York to “work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceit of the liberal MSM.” The Post quickly unraveled the plot, and in humiliating fashion published multiple stories exposing the failed operation.",
  "Friends describe the New Jersey native as maniacally driven and extremely sensitive to criticism, and several said the botched Post job was the lowest they’ve seen him—lower even than his 2010 incarceration following the failed attempt to discover telephonic misdeeds in the Louisiana office of then-Senator Mary Landrieu.",
  "Giving a journalist access, O’Keefe said, goes “against my better judgment,” describing how he has “people with aliases” hiding in “safe houses” who are “literally putting their lives at risk.”\n\nO’Keefe had come to attend the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of supporters and kindred spirits.",
  "9 reads: “We treat our sources, subjects, colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of respect.” Right then, as I ask whether he ever feels grimy about exploiting low-level people, one of his deputies interrupts: The Channel 4 videos from Britain, a sting of Cambridge Analytica, has gone live.",
  "It was nearly a decade ago that O’Keefe snuck onto America’s political landscape with his takedown of ACORN, the liberal community organizing behemoth that was defunded after he and Hannah Giles posed as a pimp and prostitute and secretly videotaped employees advising them how to shelter an off-the-books brothel.",
  "Just before our conversation, he and O’Keefe are on a conference call with one of their many lawyers; they are presently ensnared in countless lawsuits, and to make things more interesting, the attorneys general of California and New York are threatening to request the identities of their undercover operatives.",
  "“I stopped working with him after Louisiana.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nJames O’Keefe’s Greatest Hits Kneecapping ACORN\n\nWith financial support from Andrew Breitbart, O’Keefe and activist Hannah Giles in 2009 went undercover at the offices of ACORN, then the country’s largest community organizing group, as a pimp and prostitute.",
  "He remains bitter that “no journalist cared” when he was arrested and jailed—and given three years of federal probation—for the misdemeanor charge of entering a federal building under false pretenses, when in fact he used his real driver’s license and legally filmed conversations in Landrieu’s office.",
  "The whole point was, how do you get a meeting with the Washington Post?”\n\nStill, two things are notable: First, that O’Keefe, who holds such a low opinion of the media, relied on the Post’s being sufficiently ethical so as to not publish Phillips’ blockbuster account, even anonymously.",
  "O’Keefe’s undercover reporter, Jaime Phillips, used her real name—encouraged for legal, if not ethical, reasons—when meeting a Post reporter and telling a fabricated story about how Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had slept with her as a teenager and forced her to have an abortion.",
  "Project Veritas was given a dose of its own medicine last fall when, after an ill-conceived and dreadfully executed attempt to sting the Washington Post went south, the newspaper flipped the script on O’Keefe and released its own tape of reporters unmasking his undercover operative.",
  "“We think there’s a lot out there that needs to be exposed that isn’t left or right, or conservative or liberal, it’s just wrong.” It’s worth pointing out, though, that Halderman hails from conventional media, an industry in which the revenue comes from advertisers and subscribers.",
  "The group raised more money and hired more operatives last year than ever, and O’Keefe, leading the largest undercover reporting outfit on Earth, boasts that he has people inside some of America’s most influential organizations—media, technology and government entities among them.",
  "Running the newspaper brought O’Keefe under the tutelage of Ben Wetmore, then director of student publications for the Leadership Institute, an organization based in the D.C. area that trains young conservative activists and has alumni scattered throughout the Republican Party.",
  "I would come to realize, however, that O’Keefe’s reluctance to change might have less to do with a commitment to partisan warfare than it does a mutually escalating blood feud with the media, one that has left him feeling isolated, ostracized and unwilling to give an inch.",
  "“If you want to pursue truth and fight for something good,” O’Keefe says, “you’re going to be hated.”\n\nCLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story suggested that both Foval and Creamer were captured on video discussing plans to disrupt Trump rallies with violence.",
  "Not-So-Brilliant Disguise\n\nIn 2010, O’Keefe and three partners hatched a scheme in which two of them pretended to be telephone repair technicians to break into the office of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana to prove she was ignoring constituent calls.",
  "Yet O’Keefe told me he considers them “good friends.”\n\nUndercover reporting is a young person’s game, based on the demographic queued up at CPAC for O’Keefe to sign his new book, American Pravda, a Trump-inspired attack on the “fake news” of the mainstream media.",
  "“I’m glad the Post outed him.”\n\nJames O’Keefe’s Epic Fails The “Pleasure Palace” Flop\n\nO’Keefe invited CNN investigative correspondent Abbie Boudreau to meet him for an interview on a boat filled with champagne, strawberries, sex props and recording equipment.",
  "The final cut captured harsh comments about Tea Partiers made by an NPR executive, Ronald Schiller, when in fact the full recording made clear that some of Schiller’s negative comments were relaying the sentiments of others rather than speaking for himself.",
  "“Project Veritas is one-third CIA, one-third James Bond and one-third Mike Wallace.” O’Keefe had called to confirm his participation in this story, but he was struggling to reconcile his organization’s secretive approach with a reporter’s prying questions.",
  "We had taken an UberXL into midtown Manhattan hours earlier for a special fitting session: O’Keefe, the undercover sting artist and conservative folk hero, needed a new jacket and shirts to fit over the body armor recommended by his security consultants.",
  "Reporters have contacted advertisers for Alex Jones, the demagogic and conspiracy-minded radio host who is best known for claiming that the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 were faking their deaths as part of a government hoax.",
  "Two Democratic Scalps in 2016\n\nProject Veritas staffers taped Scott Foval, a national field director at the liberal nonprofit Americans United for Change, discussing how he had disrupted GOP campaign events and musing about how to cover up voter fraud.",
  "Marginalized by the media, despised by the left and banished from polite political company, the man who still longs for legitimacy as a journalist sees his foxhole so scarcely populated that he partners with known liars in the name of spreading truth.",
  "Whether it’s the specter of paralyzing litigation, severed financial relationships or punishing government intervention, the reality of O’Keefe’s existence is that Project Veritas is always going to be vulnerable to a sudden collapse—and he knows it.",
  "Project Veritas recently drafted a code of ethics, and when I raise the question of “psychological rape”—a phrase from a Gizmodo article, attributed to people unknowingly videotaped during his stings—O’Keefe opens his iPhone to show me the document.",
  "On radio row, O’Keefe was greeted by “citizen journalist” Mike Cernovich, who reminded me that Project Veritas had infiltrated Antifa and exposed a plot to pump butyric acid into the vents at his “DeploraBall” party on Trump’s inauguration weekend.",
  "Either O’Keefe continues as a partisan mercenary, eliminating any prospect of reinventing himself as an equal-opportunity watchdog; or he begins exposing corruption and wrongdoing on the right, potentially alienating the people who pay his bills.",
  "The Soros Sting That Almost Was\n\nIn a scheme apparently aimed at frequent right-wing target George Soros, Project Veritas employees called the offices of Soros’ democracy promotion organization planning to ensnare the group in a funding scheme.",
  "“He thought conservative voices on campus couldn’t be heard, and I agreed with him.” The newspaper was cheeky—O’Keefe, as editor-in-chief, embossed a hammer and sickle in the background of Livingston’s column—if not exceedingly stimulating.",
  "The Fake Roy Moore Victim\n\nO’Keefe went up against the Washington Post in 2017, attempting to bait the paper into a story with a hired actress claiming, falsely, to have been impregnated as a teenager by Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.",
  "***\n\nThe interior of Project Veritas, dressed in cherry-stained pine with black paint coating industrial-style ceilings, was inspired by O’Keefe’s only sibling, a younger sister who he says works as an architect and designer in Michigan.",
  "It wasn’t hard for Madison insiders to put two and two together, even though O’Keefe insists, “There’s no for-sale sign on my door.”\n\nHe explains that his group is constantly soliciting tips about people or groups that deserve scrutiny.",
  "Instead, he recalls, O’Keefe planned “a headline-induced, spur-of-the-moment prank.” He wanted to prove that Senator Landrieu’s office, which her Tea Party constituents were complaining they couldn’t reach, was blocking their calls.",
  "Everything changed in 1978, when the Chicago Sun-Times—having purchased a tavern and staffed it with reporters to document pervasive corruption among city officials—published a 25-part series that was chosen for a Pulitzer Prize.",

  "| Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nThis argument would elicit more sympathy if the critics were wrong about O’Keefe’s editing—it has, at times, been misleading—and if O’Keefe weren’t nurturing a double standard of his own.",
  "The videos were cited by Trump in the final presidential debate, which O’Keefe attended as his guest; Foval was fired, Creamer was exiled from the DNC, and even the New York Times gave the story prominent billing in print.",

  "Both O’Keefe and Giles were slapped with various lawsuits, and he settled for $100,000 with a San Diego employee who was fired for his remarks on camera even though he had called the police after the duo left his office.",
  "This is what separates ABC’s infamous sting of Food Lion, which yielded multimillion-dollar lawsuits, from the Washington Post’s investigation of conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which won a Pulitzer Prize.",
  "The key distinction: ABC reporters submitted fraudulent applications to land the Food Lion jobs, while the Post reporters simply evaded detection, never outright lying to hospital officials or assuming fake identities.",
  "But as proven by the recent sting operation by a British TV channel on the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, undercover reporting has been, and still can be, a devastatingly effective tool for exposing wrongdoing.",
  "He posted the videos to YouTube and hell was unleashed—first from Planned Parenthood, which sent a cease-and-desist letter, and then from the Leadership Institute, which fired O’Keefe for his provocative freelancing.",
