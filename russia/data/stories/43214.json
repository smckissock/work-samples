  "On 60 Minutes this week, Lesley Stahl describes how a company called Cambridge Analytica was able to surreptitiously gain access to the personal data of as many as 87 million Facebook users.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: So that's a remarkable accusation for someone that had to flee Russia when I was seven with my family, because we were getting death threats, because my dad was Jewish.",
  "And this money was eventually used by us to try to build a product that we abandoned, to buy some Twitter data for this abandoned product, and legal fees once Facebook came knocking.",
  "The man who mined that data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan, who told his story to Stahl in a 60 Minutes report titled \"The Data Miner.\"",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: If I did something wrong or not, that has everything to do with the American people and the global population, how they respond to it.",
  "They still feel that I violated them and they're angry that their data was taken and used in ways they could not have imagined or expected.",
  "The trouble with Kogan\n\nAleksandr Kogan: What troubles me about this is not whether I broke Facebook's terms of service.",
  "But that has nothing to do with Facebook because like--\n\nLesley Stahl: What has nothing to do with Facebook?",
  "What troubles me is how people have reacted to it, and that that fundamentally is the issue for me.",
  "Here are the clips from Stahl's interview that didn't make the broadcast:\n\nKogan: A Russian spy?",
  "That's-- first time I went back, I went for a wedding for one of my cousins, second cousins.",
  "I went when I was-- in 2013, I went on vacation with a couple of friends to St. Petersburg.",
  "If Facebook tells me, \"You are fine,\" but everybody else tells me I was wrong, I was wrong.",
  "Lesley Stahl: So when it was all said and done, you personallyâ€¦\n\nAleksandr Kogan: Nothing.",
  "Lesley Stahl: You've been described as [a] Soviet-born scientist who has been to Russia.",
  "And I think to the public-- it doesn't matter what the Facebook terms of service said.",
  "One of my vacations, I dropped by the university -- St. Petersburg State University.",
  "In addition, Cambridge Analytica eventually paid my company for the predictions.",
  "So the agreement we had with them was they would pay for the data collection.",
  "Lesley Stahl: I have seen, in print, accusations that you are a Russian spy.",
  "And so this--\n\nLesley Stahl: Because you paid people who took the quiz.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but the issue really is did you do anything wrong?",
  "Lesley Stahl: Haven't you collaborated with some Russian scientists?",
  "But my contract with Cambridge will end in September of this year.",
  "And in truth, this allowed me to just visit more often for free.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: I was never paid any salary by my company.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: And the plan was that I'd be moving on.",
  "So they paid about $800,000 to help us collect the data.",
  "I mean, I grew up right here in New York and New Jersey.",
  "I've been back to Russia a few times in my adult life.",
  "Lesley Stahl: The plan was you'd have a business.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Did Cambridge Analytica pay you?",
  "I'm like, \"Hey, it'd be great to collaborate.\"",
  "Lesley Stahl: But that doesn't exist anymore.",
  "And I met some of the psychologists there.",
  "So, I'm not here to answer to Facebook.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: I'd have a business.",
  "And that's what I'm really sorry for.",
  "And that's what's troublesome to me.",
  "200,000 people, you get to $800,000.",
  "Lesley Stahl: You're still teaching.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: That doesn't exist.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: To visit, you know?",
  "Lesley Stahl: Why did you go back?",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Junkets, exactly.",
  "What did Cambridge Analytica pay?",
  "I'm here to answer to the public.",
  "And the university pays for it.",
  "This is how academics travel.",
  "All very suspicious sounding.",
  "I went to school in the area.",
  "And then we go on vacation.",
  "I went to university here.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Exactly.",
  "And it's a lovely city.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Yeah.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Yeah.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Junkets.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Yeah.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Nothing?",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Yeah.",
  "Aleksandr Kogan: Yeah.",
  "I still have my lab.",
  "You have your lab?",
  "$3 to $4 a person.",
  "Lesley Stahl: Oh.",
  "We go give talks."
