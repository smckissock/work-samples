  "Last week a prominent Australian lawmaker was forced out amid accusations about his involvement with Beijing, and, earlier this week, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull cited \"disturbing reports about Chinese influence\" while announcing proposals to clamp down on foreign meddling in domestic politics.",
  "The Chinese embassy in Australia released a retaliatory statement on Wednesday, saying that \"China has no intention to interfere in Australia's internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations.\"",
