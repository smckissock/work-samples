  "REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nMany conservative lawmakers opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that President Hassan Rouhani’s government agreed with the six powers on July 14, and the vote — which followed a bad-tempered, rowdy debate on Sunday — lifts a significant hurdle to putting the deal into effect.",
  "Ingrained mutual mistrust could cause delays in the implementation of the nuclear deal and provoke further heated debate both in Iran and the United States, where opposition conservative Republicans lost a battle to torpedo the accord in Congress, but is unlikely to derail it altogether, analysts say.",

  "Some U.S. sanctions not related to the nuclear file will remain in place, but that has not deterred foreign business delegations that have flocked to Tehran ahead of the expected opening of markets in the oil-rich nation of 80 million people.",
  "Conservative hardliners, including Khamenei, fear Western powers aim to use transparency required by the nuclear deal to access Iran’s state secrets, or that it will usher in a detente with the West harmful to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
  "On Sunday, Iran tested a new precision-guided ballistic missile, the first such weapon able to reach its regional arch-enemy Israel, defying a U.N. resolution that bans Iran from developing missiles that could deliver a nuclear warhead.",
  "She added that Khamenei was now likely to support Rouhani’s government in carrying out the deal, while also highlighting parliament’s insistence on limiting access to military sites for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.",
  "On Oct. 7, however, Khamenei appeared to put the brakes on moderates hoping the deal will end Iran’s isolation by banning any further negotiations between Iran and the United States, contradicting expectations voiced by Rouhani.",

  "“There is a process within the JCPOA to manage any disputes that arise... it’s too early to say that (the question of military access) is going to cause a crisis,” Geranmayeh said.",
  "The bill also calls on Iran’s government to impose strict curbs on U.N. nuclear inspectors’ access to military sites, leaving the possibility that disagreements could still arise.",
  "The IAEA wants to be able to visit military sites if it deems this necessary to verify that Iran’s nuclear program is wholly for the purpose of peaceful energy as Tehran asserts.",
  "For their part, Western critics of the agreement say that it is not tough enough to prevent Iran eventually perfecting the ability to build an atomic bomb with enriched uranium.",
  "The draft bill also says Iran should resume all nuclear activity that it would halt as part of the deal, if the other side fails to meet its obligations to lift sanctions.",
