  "Josh Pollack of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told CNN the weapons test represented Kim Jong-un “tiptoeing towards a more aggressive posture in negotiations with the U.S.” and “signaling that he’s not going to give way and can simply return to his old practices.”\n\n“It’s North Korea-style coercive diplomacy.",
  "This sensational report gives the impression North Korea just tested a game-changing weapon on par with its Hwasong-15 missile, which was test-launched in 2017 under Kim’s supervision and is regarded by military analysts as North Korea’s first truly reliable intercontinental ballistic missile.",

  "“The state-of-the-art weapon that has been long developed under the leadership of our party’s dynamic leadership has a meaning of completely safeguarding our territory and significantly improving the combat power of our people’s army,” North Korean media reported breathlessly on Friday.",
  "On the other hand, a source in the South Korean government told CNN the weapon tested by North Korea was merely an artillery piece, most likely a “multiple rocket launcher.”\n\n“As it is a tactical weapon test, we do not view it as a North Korean military provocation,” the source said.",
