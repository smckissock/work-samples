  "Firms with a heavier skew toward management fees and less dependence on carried interest, such as Ares Management LP and Apollo Global Management LLC, have less to lose if they take the leap since the earnings erosion at these firms can be more easily offset by a valuation boost, in the form of multiple expansion, assuming there is one.",
  "Just like the alternative asset managers, its differentiated structure has handicapped its valuation against peers:\n\nThe prospect of paying the new corporate tax rate in exchange for a potentially better stock price hasn't been enough to convince AllianceBernstein's CEO and president Seth Bernstein that it's worth converting.",
  "Plus, if founders and other employee shareholders aren't willing to give up voting control, these firms are likely to remain ineligible for the some key indexes including the S&P 500, just like Snap Inc. That would leave them with access to fewer new investors and more muted fresh demand than initially thought.",
  "It's entirely possible, though, that valuations won't budge dramatically and that new investors will agree with the longstanding notion that such firms deserve to trade at a discount to traditional asset managers, in part because of the highly unpredictable nature of a substantial portion of their earnings.",
  "Carlyle Group LP's co-founder and co-chairman David Rubenstein told Bloomberg TV this week that the Washington-based firm isn't currently considering a conversion, in part because its business model is so reliant on carried interest.",
  "Since a corporation would have to pay tax on carried interest, it'd have less cash to distribute for dividends, causing Schwarzman's dividend haul to tumble by roughly $37 million, which isn't small change.",
  "For KKR, using just one example, the switch could open the door to nearly seven times its current institutional investor base, according to a note from Sandler O'Neill's Andrew Disdier in November.",
  "The Blackstones of the world have a decision on their hands: Now that the U.S. corporate tax rate has come down, should they abandon their partnership structures in favor of becoming corporations?",
  "Fourth-quarter earnings beginning next week provide a platform for firms to unveil their latest thinking on the subject, and shareholders certainly seem buoyed by the prospect of change.",
  "These firms pay an effective tax rate that's often in the single digits, and they'd be giving that up to pay a corporate tax rate that would be higher than they're used to at 21 percent.",
  "But the key argument against a conversion rests on the currently favorable treatment of carried interest, best described as the profits earned from private equity and other investments.",
  "As corporations, these firms would be eligible for inclusion in indexes and exchange traded funds that collectively have trillions of dollars invested in (or benchmarked against) them.",
  "Among them is Jeff Ubben's ValueAct Capital Partners LP, which revealed a bet on KKR & Co. last spring that was in part driven by the belief that the firm will decide to incorporate.",
  "But if valuations skyrocket, the move to unshackle from a partnership structure would be hugely rewarding to these firms' biggest shareholders: their founders and executives.",
  "Consider the industry's leader by size, the $44 billion Blackstone Group LP as an example, if only because Steve Schwarzman took home $378 million in dividends alone in 2016.",
  "\"I'd rather have our unitholders paying the lowest level of taxes at the greatest defensible position that we can,\" he said at a conference in December.",
  "That's a view held by AllianceBernstein Holding LP, a traditional asset manager that -- unlike most of its rivals -- is a master limited partnership.",
  "If that happens, stock prices could end up at a similar or worse level thanks to eroded earnings as a result of the higher effective tax rate.",
  "David Rubenstein is the host of the Bloomberg Media television and digital series, \"The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations.\"",
  "Incorporating would force them to pay the new corporate rate on these gains, resulting in lower earnings overall and a shrunken dividend.",
  "The most compelling reason to consider a conversion is the potential surge in valuation that would result from a broadened investor base.",
  "Even if the tax-rate cut isn't reversed, the risk of depressed earnings and a far-from-guaranteed reward suggest they should stay put.",
  "Another deterrent to incorporating is the outside chance that these tax changes could be reversed or tweaked in coming years.",
  "Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a non-executive director at Blackstone.",
  "Such optimism has resulted in market-beating stock gains for KKR and other peers facing the same choice.",
  "Almost half that figure was fueled by carried interest, which isn't taxed in a partnership structure.",
