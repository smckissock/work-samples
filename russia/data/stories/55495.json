  "Russian lawmakers have started looking at ways to block foreign media broadcasts in Russian if they break the law, but the Kremlin said Wednesday that the move requires careful consideration.",
  "Asked about the proposal, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, refrained from comment but noted that it should be carefully considered.",
  "He added that the prospective legislation could authorize Russia's communications watchdog to block broadcasts if they violate the law.",
  "Klimov said his panel is discussing changes in the law to require foreign media outlets to report on their funding and activities.",
  "\"Such initiatives need to be seriously studied by all agencies,\" he said in a conference call with reporters.",
