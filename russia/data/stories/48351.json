  "I think there’s a real risk, long term, of what happens when you’ve got a company who decides to start doing that.”\n\nChief among his other concerns is that Western democracies are sleepwalking into yet more elections without taking sufficient action to reduce the chances of another Cambridge Analytica or another Trump-Russia saga.",
  "You are entitled to say whatever it is that you want, that is fine; you are not entitled to a megaphone if that information is false.”\n\nBut he does agree that the social media companies themselves should not be the ones making the decision to “remove somebody from society,” as he puts it.",
  "If social-media platforms are going to call themselves communities, he adds, “there should be transparency and oversight, which is a role for government.”\n\nHe finds himself, awkwardly, in a similar position to Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy-theorist website InfoWars.",
  "But Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had previously boasted of the company’s involvement, while CEO Alexander Nix was recorded saying, “Our data informed all the strategy.” Without that data, Wylie believes Trump’s victory might not have happened.",
  "View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nNow he has given evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Cambridge Analytica’s contacts with Russia and work with Donald Trump’s campaign and to a U.K. inquiry investigating the role of fake news in the 2016 E.U.",
  "His revelations kicked off a debate about the untrammeled power of tech giants and the vulnerability of Western democracies to disinformation–concerns that, Wylie says, social-media companies have failed to address as U.S. midterms approach.",
  "Facebook’s stock price fell 7% after Wylie revealed that data obtained from a quiz app on its site was being used by political campaigns to identify people’s specific characteristics–such as openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism.",
  "Wylie had already shown his profiling tool to billionaire Robert Mercer–who partly owned and funded Cambridge Analytica and went on to become a Trump mega-donor; he had also shared it with Trump’s future campaign chief Stephen Bannon.",
  "In all, Cambridge Analytica took data from 30 million to 87 million profiles and combined it with data from sources like TV set-top boxes and credit cards to build an incredibly detailed picture of segments of the U.S. electorate.",
  "Six months on from uncovering information that shook the world’s biggest social-media companies and questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 U.S. election, Wylie isn’t holed up in an embassy or in exile; he’s living freely in London.",
  "At the hearing, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg testified that their companies were taking sufficient action to protect the November midterms from foreign interference.",
  "Jones has been permanently banned from Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms in recent months following a drawn-out debate over whether the sites should give his often untrue and inflammatory content a platform.",
  "He says he has tried to redeem himself by raising awareness of just how vulnerable social-media users are to exploitation, whether by foreign actors, shady political consultancies or the companies themselves.",
  "“The idea that we should trust the security of our digital spaces to private companies that have no accountability except to themselves is ridiculous.”\n\nWylie speaks with a certain authority on the matter.",
  "“The infrastructure of our democracy is just open season right now.”\n\nAlthough he continues pushing for tech regulation, Wylie has left political consulting to work in fashion, using data to spot trends.",
  "In March, he publicly revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy he helped found in 2013, used illegally obtained Facebook data to psychologically profile voters for electoral campaigns.",
  "After leaving school in Canada at 16, Wylie–who was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia as a teenager–threw himself into learning about the political uses of data.",
  "Canadian-born Wylie had been the brains behind the company’s methodology but left in fall 2014, reportedly unhappy with his bosses’ willingness to work with right-wing politicians.",
  "The week before we meet, Google declined to send a senior executive to testify before the Senate on Sept. 5 about the role of tech companies in election meddling by foreign actors.",
  "“You’ve got social media companies that do not have to provide a fair process, a due process, and can unilaterally get rid of people because they disagree with what’s being said.",
  "Then all of a sudden everyone wears Crocs, and a couple of years later people look at photos of themselves and go, ‘What the f-ck was I just wearing–that was hideous.",
  "This impacts people’s lives on an hour-by-hour basis, and there are no rules.” But how can real regulation happen in a cyberspace that transcends national borders?",
  "The company attempted to ride out the storm caused by Wylie’s revelations but eventually found itself forced to close in May after several clients bailed.",
  "Wylie barely looks at the polished revolving doors through which, six months earlier, his former boss was bundled by aides to avoid waiting journalists.",
  "“And that harms a lot of people.”\n\nLeaving Google’s office behind, we make our way past Cambridge Analytica’s old headquarters, on New Oxford Street.",
  "It’s a task made harder by the fact he’s still banned from Facebook, a company that he says has unique, unregulated power over public discourse.",
  "“People are willing to do really ugly things if lots of other people are also doing them.”\n\nWrite to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com.",

  "By 20, he found himself in London juggling his university studies with work on voter targeting for the U.K.’s centrist Liberal Democrats.",
  "Trump campaign officials said Cambridge Analytica only “provided limited staffing” in 2016 and that none of the Facebook data was used.",

  "But Wylie is at pains to point out a crucial difference between himself and the Texan, because his own revelations were truthful.",
  "Cambridge Analytica used this data to target voters with political content tailored to their individual psychological profile.",
  "“It is possible to create some common ground rules on the Internet in our international framework of nation states,” he says.",
  "More damaging to Facebook, the app was allowed to scrape the personal details of the friends of anybody who had used it.",
  "“You’re going to get a situation where you’ve created an atomic bomb,” he says, pausing before carrying on more softly.",
  "Though Wylie left Cambridge Analytica well before his work was adapted for the Trump campaign, the damage was done.",
  "It’s a brightly colored building that stands out–not unlike Wylie himself, with his pink hair and nose ring.",
  "On a crisp morning in early September, Christopher Wylie is waiting opposite Google’s London headquarters.",
  "“I call bullsh-t on that,” says Wylie, 29, who has become a cheerleader for greater regulation online.",
  "Compare the unregulated social-media landscape to food, electricity and airplane safety laws, he says.",
  "He took these findings out of a laboratory context and set about applying them at the national level.",
  "“I’m sorry Alex Jones, but the content that InfoWars has been putting out is just flat out lies.",
