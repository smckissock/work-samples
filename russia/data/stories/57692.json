  "Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nA lawyer for the co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the controversial dossier that detailed President Donald Trump's alleged connections to Russia, told congressional investigators that a person was killed as a result of the document, according to testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee released by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday.",
  "The comment came after Jason Foster, chief investigative counsel for Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, asked how the firm assessed the veracity of the information contained within the dossier.",
  "Republican-led committees are looking into whether the dossier was what led to the initial FBI investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials in the 2016 election.",
  "The dossier itself was written by former British M16 intelligence agent Christopher Steele and has come under fire from Trump and his allies as politically motivated.",
  "Glenn Simpson, the former Wall Street Journal journalist and a founder of Fusion GPS, responded that he would not get into any information related to sourcing.",
  "\"Somebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.\"",
  "\"It's a voluntary interview, and in addition to that he wants to be very careful to protect his sources,\" Levy said.",
  "While the administration has taken aim at the credibility of the document, some parts have been corroborated.",
  "The lawyer does not note who was killed elsewhere in the transcript of the August 22 interview.",
  "When Foster pressed Simpson on why he was declining to answer, his lawyer, Joshua Levy, cut in.",
  "Glenn Simpson."
