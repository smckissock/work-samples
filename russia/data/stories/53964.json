  "If they consider this a big deal, how will they... — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) June 25, 2018\n\nBut after several news organizations, including The Associated Press, reported on the meeting, two prosecutors called Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, and told him that they were concerned about media attention in the case, he said.",
  "Cohen had said he paid Daniels himself, through a limited liability company known as Essential Consultants, LLC, and that \"neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly.\"",
  "Porn actress Stormy Daniels was scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors in New York on Monday as part of their investigation into President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, but the meeting was abruptly cancelled late Sunday after it was reported by news organizations, her attorney said.",
  "Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was supposed to meet with prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan in preparation for a possible grand jury appearance as they work to assemble a case against Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.",
  "Avenatti offered to move the meeting to another location and reiterated that Daniels — who he says has been cooperating with prosecutors for months — was ready to go forward with the meeting, but they called back to cancel it, he said.",
  "So I was just informed by the US Attys office that they are canceling the mtg tmrw scheduled with me and my client (for weeks) because the press found out about the mtg and they can’t handle a few cameras outside their offices.",
  "In April, FBI agents raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room as part of a probe into his business dealings and investigators were seeking records about the nondisclosure agreement that Daniels had signed, among other things.",
  "As part of their investigation into Cohen, prosecutors have been examining the $130,000 payment that was made to Daniels as part of a confidentiality agreement days before the 2016 presidential election.",
  "In May, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys, said the president had repaid Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, contradicting Trump's prior claims that he didn't know the source of the money.",
  "A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan had declined to comment on the meeting earlier Sunday night and did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the cancellation.",
  "Earlier this month, Trump said he hadn't spoken with Cohen — his longtime fixer and a key power player in the Trump Organization — in \"a long time\" and that Cohen is \"not my lawyer anymore.\"",
  "Daniels and Avenatti have also turned over documents in response to a subpoena from federal prosecutors about the $130,000 that Daniels was paid, a person familiar with the matter said.",
  "If prosecutors bring a case to a grand jury, they could call witnesses to testify under oath and the grand jury would decide whether to bring criminal charges with a written indictment.",
  "Daniels' interview had been in preparation for a possible grand jury appearance in the federal investigation into Cohen's business dealings, the person familiar with the matter said.",
  "\"We believe canceling the meeting because the press has now caught wind of it is ridiculous,\" Avenatti wrote in an email to Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos.",
  "Daniels is suing to invalidate the confidentiality agreement that prevents her from discussing the alleged relationship with Trump.",
  "He later tweeted that he and his client have \"bent over backwards to accommodate\" prosecutors and that the move was \"unheard of.\"",
  "They weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
  "She argues the nondisclosure agreement should be invalidated because Cohen, signed it, but the president did not.",
  "The meeting has not been rescheduled and prosecutors offered no other explanation for the cancellation, he said.",
  "\"We do not think it was any secret that at some point you were going to meet with my client.\"",
  "Daniels has said she had sex with Trump in 2006 when he was married, which Trump has denied.",
  "\"I was shocked at that response,\" Avenatti said."
