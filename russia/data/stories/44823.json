  "The First Purge review – patchy, dour prequel is a nihilistic Trumpian horror Read more\n\nWhile there’s still the standard checklist of shouting, clicking, screaming, buffering and dying, it’s also a film that’s surprisingly plugged into the world around us and it’s uploading into cinemas just weeks after The First Purge, another horror sequel that felt strangely of the time with visual nods to an increase in far-right violence, including a queasy Charlottesville “homage”.",
  "The online framework is used for some inventive suspense (an unstable wifi connection, death scenes teased by YouTube montages) but while the performances remain convincing, the film often struggles to convince us on some of their decision-making with some of the clicking, downloading and digging feeling as dumb as a creepy basement investigation in a more traditionally presented horror film.",
  "Coupled with the discovery of a hidden folder of unsettling, voyeuristic video files, Matias starts to question just what the previous owner was up to …\n\nThe practice of watching a story play out via a laptop screen on a bigger screen is still relatively, mercifully unusual and there’s a make-or-break period of acclimatization that takes place during the first 10 minutes.",
  "Even if some of the late-stage plotting seems sloppy and increasingly preposterous, there’s a callousness to the brutal last act that, together with the far patchier, yet similarly hard-edged First Purge, feels like a definite product of the time we’re in, as war on terror-era torture porn did in the mid-2000s.",
  "It strives for authenticity and acceptance from its young target demographic and while its hi-tech trappings might age fast (many of its real-world nods appear in the trending news box on the Facebook homepage which has since been scrapped), an abundance of effort is rarely a bad thing in the horror genre.",
  "If you were to guess which 2018 film contained references to student gun reform, Cambridge Analytica, Flint’s ongoing water problem and the Iranian nuclear deal, I’m going to take a big leap here and assume that you wouldn’t have predicted a sequel to 2014’s laptop-based cyber-horror Unfriended.",
  "The first, and doubtfully last, sequel to sleeper hit Unfriended, which turned a $1m budget into a $64m gross, isn’t worthy of any real comparison to Jordan Peele’s socially minded game-changer but together with the recent Purge prequel, it suggests a certain brand awareness of audience.",
  "The characters who tapped and scrolled their way through Unfriended were so intensely vile that watching them fall prey to a vengeful cyber-ghost was a relief, the unending splurge of obnoxious revelations removing any investment we might have in their fate.",
  "They’re friends with a lesbian couple, played by Rebecca Rittenhouse and Get Out’s Betty Gabriel, who face parental issues on the news of their engagement, and the very existence of gay characters in a genre movie is something of a rarity.",
  "The laptop-lifting protagonist is trying to perfect a piece of software that will make communication with his deaf girlfriend that much easier and, for the genre, their storyline is handled with surprising sensitivity.",
  "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Blumhouse Tilt\n\nThere’s a concerted attempt in the follow-up to create a more involving scenario with characters we might not want to see die quite so horrifically.",
  "Both come from Blumhouse, the staggeringly successful production company that struck gold with last year’s razor sharp thriller Get Out but has gained an industry foothold through aggressive franchising.",
  "It also helps that the nefarious web they get caught up in unfolds like a tantalizing mystery thriller, each detail grimier than the last, building up to an effectively nasty underworld of online evil.",
  "It’s frustrating when stupidity sets in and some of the visual trickery that worked in the earlier stages starts to grate, with unintentional laughter emerging from some of the silliest on-screen IMs.",
  "screen, one’s focus in constant demand by information popping up all over the place, and it’s an experience that will prove intensely frustrating for many but for me, far less so than its predecessor.",
  "The iciness of the villains extends beyond digital spaces and into the real world, an inability to see people as anything more than avatars to troll, abuse and violate.",
  "It’s hardly a script with a great deal of depth but as first-time director Stephen Susco ups the ante, and the violence, we’re just that little bit more invested.",
  "In Unfriended: Dark Web, we start on the home screen of software developer Matias’s new laptop, one that he found at a local cafe and took as his own.",
  "It’s game night with his friends and due to laziness, travel constraints and one of them living in another continent, it’s taking place via Skype.",
  "But it’s hard to concentrate on Cards Against Humanity when a previously logged in stranger’s Facebook page is blowing up with odd messages.",
  "Part of this is down to the shift in narrative from a tale of cyberbullying to a shadowy conspiracy.",
  "While its scares might not linger, its bleak worldview will.",
  "It’s most definitely not a film to double (triple?)"
