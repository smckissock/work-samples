  "Story Continued Below\n\nA fluke related to the methodology Clinton lawyers used to sort the messages led to the five being deemed work-related and sent to State, but most such messages received during her tenure as secretary were discarded, according to little-noticed language in a statement Clinton’s office issued earlier this year.",
  "\"The question is if they had sent that to an email at the Department of State, would she have ever seen it, and I’d say probably not because the Department of State is very cautious and very conservative when it comes to email attachments,” said Ron Gula, CEO of Tenable Security and a former penetration tester at the NSA.",
  "A Clinton aide confirmed Thursday that the five phishing messages, first reported by the Associated Press on Wednesday, were sent to State because they used made-up addresses such as \"info.5@nyc.gov\" and the protocol established by Clinton's lawyers presumed all messages containing a \".gov\" address to be work-related.",
  "But since spam plagues most inboxes, the issue isn't really how many phishing attempts or viruses were sent to Clinton's private account, but whether they would have made it to a state.gov inbox if she had had one and whether her agency had mechanisms her private server did not to neutralize such threats.",
  "It's virtually impossible for anyone except the FBI to know how many virus-bearing messages or attempts to pilfer personal information Hillary Clinton received on her private email account during her four years as secretary of state because most of those messages were deleted at her direction.",
  "Clinton's office said earlier this year that her private server, which also was used by former President Bill Clinton, had \"robust protections\" along with \"additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third-party experts.\"",
  "The spam emails raised eyebrows about the security of Clinton's private server, with some experts noting that if marketers or other writers of spam emails were able to get into her inbox, so, too, could foreign intelligence services or others seeking to intercept her communications.",
  "Henry described State’s cybersecurity controls as “not perfect” but noted “there are a lot more tools, more protocols and more polices on the way that data is handled, how it’s shared and how it’s maintained” that would have shut out phishing emails or similar threats.",
  "One thing FBI investigators are sure to be examining as they investigate Clinton’s server is other malware-laden emails from her deleted personal stash, said Shawn Henry, president of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and a former executive assistant FBI director.",
  "“After her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Secretary Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal messages [including] items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.” the statement said.",
  "However, Clinton has insisted that she's unware of any intrusion into her account, and her aides said there's no indication she clicked on the \"zip\" files attached to the five phishing emails, which would have heightened the security risk.",
  "On Thursday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged publicly for the first time that his agents are looking into Clinton's private email account and \"the possible exposure of classified information through that account.\"",
  "However, the five fake speeding-ticket notices sent to Clinton and released by the State Department Wednesday were likely just a fraction of the spam and phishing messages she received on her so-called homebrew server.",
  "It's also known that State's unclassified Internet systems were repeatedly compromised by online attacks from Russia, prompting State to shut down those systems entirely for a couple of days earlier this year.",
  "\"I am confident that we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, as we do all our work, so we’re able to do it as we do all our work in a professional, prompt and independent way.\"",
  "While Clinton's attorney indicated earlier this year that the messages deemed personal were erased, a Bloomberg News report earlier this month said at least some of those messages had been recovered.",
  "Following the attack, the department imposed stringent requirements regarding which attachments employees could open, which have contributed to making the department’s IT more difficult to work with.",
  "Still, since most spam or phishing messages don't come from a \".gov\" address, experts said it's virtually certain the FBI will find a considerable stash of them among those Clinton sought to erase.",
  "Some of those emails may be similarly innocuous looking, while others may be more sophisticated and possibly nation state-backed attempts to worm into Clinton’s server, he said.",
  "Once investigators spot it, they still have to determine whether it’s the sort of common malware that can infect any computer or a more insidious worm sent by a nation state.",
  "“I don’t think we can know definitively, but the odds are definitely in favor of there being more,” said Justin Harvey, chief security officer at Fidelis Cybersecurity.",
  "Clinton campaign officials declined to quantify how many of the roughly 30,000 erased messages were considered “spam” akin to the five messages released Wednesday.",
  "Two former State Department employees contacted by POLITICO differed about the volume of spam messages they received by email on state.gov accounts.",
  "That investigation can be an exceptionally laborious process, analysts said, because malware can be hidden in thousands of places on a computer.",
  "\"I am following this very closely, and I get briefed on it regularly,\" Comey told reporters during a roundtable at FBI headquarters.",
  "Comey referred to the FBI's efforts only as \"our work [on] the matter\" and notably did not refer to the effort as an investigation.",
  "Gula traced the origin of State’s anxiety about attachments to a 2006 Chinese attack that inserted malware via a Word attachment.",
  "He denied any concern about the impact on Clinton's presidential candidacy or how the inquiry could affect upcoming primaries.",
  "“By setting up a separate server she circumvented all of that and jeopardized the security of that data,” he said.",
  "In August, the FBI obtained a server a Colorado-based technology company used to store Clinton's emails.",
  "Clinton aides declined to elaborate, citing concerns about \"broadcasting specific technical details.\"",
  "\"If you know my folks, you know that they don’t give a rip about politics,\" he said.",
  "So spam or not, it came from a .gov, so they included it,\" the aide said.",
  "It infected offices at Main State and in Asia-based U.S. embassies.",
  "\"Llike everything else, they were over-inclusive.",
  "The other said she recalled no such messages.",
  "One said such messages were common."
