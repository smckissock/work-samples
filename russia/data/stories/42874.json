  "According to the consulting firm’s own website, the data collected allowed them to create a profile of the Kenyan electorate and come up with a campaign strategy “based on the electorate’s needs (jobs) and fears (tribal violence).”\n\nIn a report for Global Voices (the organization I work for), Kenyan blogger Njeri Wangari Wanjohi wrote, “This begs the question of what type of strategy the company might have proposed (as stated in their materials) that would be based on the electorate’s fears of tribal violence.” She then pointed to the very real threat of ethnic violence in Kenya, recalling the 2007 general election, when tribal clashes led to 1,500 deaths and left more than 600,000 people homeless.",

  "In all five of the countries with the largest populations of Facebook users—India, the U.S., Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico—there is compelling evidence that people and companies are either buying or exploiting Facebook’s vast data troves and easy-to-use advertising and information-sharing services in an effort to influence election outcomes.",
  "What we do know is that public corruption and drug-related violence in Mexico are at record-high levels and that these elections—in which a total of 3,000 seats are being contested at local, state, and federal levels, including the presidency—could bring about a sea of change in Mexico’s political power structure.",

  "But as Zuckerberg himself acknowledged, the problem at hand is not unique to the U.S. With Facebook boasting 2.2 billion active users in nearly every country, the problem is incredibly global and thus much harder to solve than policymakers may realize.",

  "In her opening remarks at Tuesday’s Senate hearing, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein impressed upon Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg the importance of preventing “foreign actors” from interfering in U.S. elections.",
  "While foreign actors may be at the root of some of these cases, in others, all signs indicate that national political parties are using these strategies against one another—there is no foreign actor to blame.",
  "Throughout the hearings on both Monday and Tuesday, we were reminded again and again that for members of Congress and the U.S. media, the threat of Russian interference in American elections is the story.",
