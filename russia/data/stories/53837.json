  "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc paid Essential Consultants, a company set up by President Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen, more than the $200,000 that came to light late on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.",
  "His client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the election, to buy her silence about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.",
