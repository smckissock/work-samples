  "Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk has sketched out in bold terms the problem facing tax authorities in getting their hands on tech giants’ profits, though he is more cautious when it comes to recommending a fix: In a draft note to leaders, seen by Playbook, ahead of a Thursday dinner debate on the topic, he writes of the “mismatch” of digital businesses that don’t have a physical presence and “derive their value mostly from intangible assets,” exposing “shortcomings in our taxation systems.” Tusk deplores “an erosion of the tax base, effectively reducing government tax revenues … In short, it affects ordinary citizens’ quality of life.” His description of the problem is widely shared by EU capitals.",
  "Sidenote: There’s huge interest in the EU’s staff regulations among European citizens, according to Giegold, who said “our list of questions has grown stronger thanks to the support of civil society.”\n\nThe man in question appeared for the first time since being appointed secretary-general on a panel with Austrian writer Robert Menasse on Monday evening in Brussels, at a packed representation of the German state of Hesse (the only other time they manage to secure the presence of literally every German speaker in the bubble is when they do their Weinfest every fall).",
  "“I don’t know how Macron describes himself, but I can be quite clear that he’s not a social democrat.”\n\nWhat distinguishes the Belgian candidate from her German challenger is that Van Brempt puts a focus on strict green climate and energy goals: One official inside the group told Maïa that Van Brempt has built most of her reputation on environmental and green issues, and has taken “very ambitious” positions — including fighting against the use of coal — “many of which have upset delegations of Eastern European MEPs.” Full story on the leadership race here.",
  "Tusk’s job is unenviable: “Taxation is an important but technically and legally complex area,” he writes, adding: “Taxation matters are decided at the EU level by unanimity,” though some issues should be dealt with “at both the EU and the global (OECD/G20) level.” Reading between the lines, the suggestion is that leaders would be happy for the G20 to decide on an international approach (though the news from Buenos Aires, where central bank governors and finance ministers continue their G20 meeting, isn’t promising in that regard).",
  "Green MEPs Bart Staes and Sven Giegold’s questions on the Selmayr affair, submitted for the attention of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, will provide, if the Commission answers them, a very detailed picture of the proceedings during the fateful February 21 College of Commissioners’ meeting during which Martin Selmayr was given a double promotion to become the EU’s top civil servant (and perhaps a picture of how the key players worked the corridors in the lead-up).",
  "She would make the S&D “look to the left,” be “strict on our values” and “very much on top of the most important files such as the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework, migration and climate politics.”\n\nVan Brempt doesn’t particularly sympathize with the idea that French President Emmanuel Macron could be a savior of the left and expressed no desire to team up with a parliamentary group led by his En Marche, should he decide to set one up.",
  "The Commission is asking data protection authorities to do the same, with European Justice Commissioner Vera Jourová tweeting that the revelations are “horrifying, if confirmed.” A spokesperson said in a statement that the Commission had spoken with European data protection authorities (also known as the Article 29 Working Party), who promised to discuss the issue today during their meeting in Brussels.",
