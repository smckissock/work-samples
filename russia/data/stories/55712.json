  "Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today on the Russian government’s attempts to repeal the Magnitsky Act in Washington in 2016, and the enablers who conducted this campaign in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, by not disclosing their roles as agents for foreign interests.",
  "From what followed, it appeared that Putin’s answer was, “Fifty percent.” He wasn’t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally.",
  "Before I get into the actions of the agents who conducted the anti-Magnitsky campaign in Washington for the benefit of the Russian state, let me share a bit of background about Sergei Magnitsky and myself.",
  "Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom.",
  "Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did.",
  "In Russia, your enemy’s enemy is your friend, and even though I’ve never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.",
  "From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.",
  "After Khodorkovsky’s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky.",
  "For a time, this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in.",
  "From 1996 to 2005, my firm, Hermitage Capital, was one of the largest investment advisers in Russia with more than $4 billion invested in Russian stocks.",
  "When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president’s power as well.",
  "Russia has a well-known reputation for corruption; unfortunately, I discovered that it was far worse than many had thought.",
  "While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised.",
  "That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia’s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.",
  "I grew up in Chicago, but for the last 28 years I’ve lived in Moscow and London, and am now a British citizen.",
  "That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position.",
  "When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.",
  "Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies.",
  "They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors.",
  "I am the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management.",
  "Why?"
