  "Source: Facebook More\n\nIOS users will be able to upload 9 photos, while Android users will be able upload 12 photos to their dating profiles, as well as input some information that’s optional beyond their gender and the gender/s they’re interested in: height, religion, job title, company, education, children and the answers to questions like “What’s your perfect day?” They can express interest in — and send one unsolicited message to — up to 100 matches a day, a cap Facebook imposed to avoid seemingly endless Tinder-like searches.",
  "Coffee Meets Bagel CEO and co-founder Dawoon Kang told Yahoo Finance in August that the dating service saw a 378% increase in requests from users for a different way to log on — besides using Facebook — following the news in mid-March that voting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the Facebook data of up to 87 million individuals.",
  "The social network says over 200 million users list themselves as “single,” and while it has no plans of charging for its dating feature, it stands to seriously boost user engagement if even a fraction of those single users spend more time checking out and chatting up other singles on Facebook.",
  "Once Facebook Dating is eventually rolled out in is entirety, however, Facebook users interested in dating on the social network must follow a set-up process, in which they create an entirely new dating profile independent of their main Facebook profile.",
  "“We do think that it’s probably not the healthiest to just message more than 100 people a day,” explained Nathan Sharp, Facebook product manager for Facebook Dating, adding that the figure could change, depending on feedback from users.",
  "Those privacy concerns explain why dating profiles are separate from main profiles, why its dating chat feature is independent from Facebook Messenger, and why there’s an option to only see matches you don’t share mutual friends with.",
  "The social network continues to combat public concerns over data privacy, which includes apprehensiveness from at least some singles who are uneasy over the idea of somehow tying their dating-related data to their Facebook data.",
  "The ability to actually review, express interest in and chat up potential matches is coming later at an unspecified date to make sure a sufficient number of people have created profiles and there are enough people to match with.",
  "We want you to be considerate of a few people that you’re really interested in, and message them.”\n\nMatchmaking the Facebook way\n\nFor Facebook, the rationale behind entering the dating space is dead-simple.",

  "“We kind of set the limit somewhat higher, expecting that most people won’t hit that.",
  "The rationale for most Coffee Meets Bagel users who made the request?",
  "For Facebook (FB), dating apparently is done with small, baby steps.",
