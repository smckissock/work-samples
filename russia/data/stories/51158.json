  "Rather, he sounds like a subordinate trying to persuade higher-ups, at one point asking that the brotherhood “not rush to throw these papers away.”\n\nIn 2011 testimony before the House Select Intelligence Committee, Tarek Masoud, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, said that Adlouni’s list of Muslim organizations appeared “aspirational.”\n\n“It seemed to me upon reading the memorandum that the Muslim Brotherhood member who wrote it believed that his organization was not working with American Muslim organizations and should be,” Masoud recounted to HuffPost this week.",
  "“The Muslim Brotherhood has become a boogeyman for these people and it’s just become the dirty word you can connect these groups to,” said Eli Clifton, a fellow at the Nation Institute and co-author of the Center for American Progress’ 2011 report “Fear Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America.”\n\n“I think there’s very limited evidence, if any, that [the Muslim Brotherhood] have gained an active role in the U.S., or that it influences in a direct way the policies or advocacy positions of groups representing Muslim Americans,” Clifton said.",
  "The day after the election, Gaffney told Breitbart Radio that Trump’s win was “literally a blessing from God” and that declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group would be a key part of Trump’s “strategy of victory over jihad.”\n\nAnd then, as if to encapsulate his own conspiracy theory, Gaffney said, “We’ve got to stop taking counsel from [the Muslim Brotherhood], direction from them, and allowing them to operate in our midst subversively, and that’s what’s been going on for some 50 years now.”\n\nBrigitte Gabriel, founder of Act for America ?",
  "“This initiative is concerned with controlling American Muslims, not with any issue pertaining to the Muslim Brotherhood in any practical or realistic sense.”\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood affects CAIR the way a dust storm on Mars affects the weather in Washington, D.C. Corey Saylor of the Council on American-Islamic Relations\n\nFor years, anti-Muslim groups have claimed that CAIR, the country’s largest Muslim civil rights organization, and other pro-Islam groups in the U.S. are, in fact, fronts for the brotherhood.",
  "“Its primary purpose is not acts of violence,” Trager said, “but to promote a theocratic, power-seeking and exclusivist position that is very explicitly anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-Western and even anti-those Muslims who do not share its outlook.”\n\nAnother complication for those pushing for a terror-group label, Trager said, is that the Muslim Brotherhood was essentially “decapitated” after Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, who had close ties to the brotherhood, was ousted in 2013.",
  "In a press release, Cruz said that the brotherhood espouses “a violent Islamist ideology with a mission of destroying the West” and that formally designating them a terror group would “enable the U.S. to take action that could stifle the funding they receive to promote their terrorist activities.”\n\nIt’s the fifth time members of the Senate and House, urged on by a multimillion-dollar network of anti-Muslim groups, have attempted to label the Muslim Brotherhood a terror organization.",
  "With enough allies in the state legislature, Gottschalk said, they “established [the] Smelling Committee to examine Irish Catholic homes, schools, and churches for possible weapons while prominent Irish Catholics and organizations were viewed as puppets of the Vatican.”\n\nWhether the particular target was Jews or Catholics or Muslims, Gottschalk said, the goal was always “to smear Americans as under foreign institutional control and part of an international conspiracy.”",
  "“It takes five or eight years to join,” he said, and “they vet you at every stage.”\n\nTrager thinks there are groups in the U.S. that might “share some views with the Brotherhood, sort of ascribe to the same ideology, that have the same view that Islam should control every aspect of life.” Members of the brotherhood are sometimes invited to speak at events held by American Muslim organizations, he said, pointing to a Muslim American Society conference last month.",
  "Lana Safah, a spokeswoman for the Muslim American Society, another high-profile Muslim advocacy group, told HuffPost that her group has “no affiliation with any foreign or international organization.”\n\nYet, she said, “in the Trump era, and in the most Islamophobic atmosphere the American Muslim community has ever experienced, it seems we should expect the unexpected, such as this unprecedented designation, which no former administration has made.",
  "Eric Trager, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of the 2016 book Arab Fall: How the Muslim Brotherhood Won and Lost Egypt in 891 Days, said there is honest concern “within the policy community more broadly that the Brotherhood is a radical organization whose ideology contributes to terrorist acts.”\n\nNonetheless, he said, there’s “no evidence” that American Muslim groups are fronts for the brotherhood.",
  "It is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, whose website describes Gaffney as “gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within, suspicious that Barack Obama was actually born in Kenya, and a proponent of a new version of the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee to root out suspected Muslim subversives.”\n\nGaffney has also baselessly accused multiple political figures ?",
  "“When you render a group a terrorist group,” he said, “that opens up the door for a lot of really damaging possibilities, like endless prosecution of Muslim Americans that simply hold different political or religious positions than Cruz, [Ben] Carson, Gaffney, Trump and that band of fear-mongers.”\n\nWhen groups like CAIR are weakened or dismantled, the people they represent become more vulnerable to persecution.",
  "But even among those countries that have banned the Brotherhood, there is much variation in how they have dealt with the group over time and in their own relations with Brotherhood organizations in different countries.”\n\nA ‘Sweet Moment’ After Trump’s Victory\n\nStephanie Keith/Reuters People walk in the annual Muslim Day Parade in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 2016.",
  "In the worldview of the Center for Security Policy and similar anti-Muslim groups, Lean said, if someone’s “brother-in-law’s cousin’s nephew’s half-brother was once in the grocery store lane with a man who was in the Muslim Brotherhood ... that’s sufficient evidence that that particular individual or group is representative of the Muslim Brotherhood.",
  "A 2009 American Civil Liberties Union review of Muslim charities in the crosshairs found that Bush’s executive order “effectively allows the government to shut down an organization without notice or hearing and on the basis of classified evidence, and without any judicial review.”\n\nNow Cruz’s legislation looks like another step along that road.",
  "A 2016 report by the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University dismissed the memorandum as “one man’s utopian vision.” Adlouni’s call for “civilization jihad” was never adopted by the brotherhood, the report concluded, and his phrasing almost never turns up in “mainstream Islamic literature” over the two decades since he wrote the document.",
  "In horrifying language, Adlouni called for the Muslim Brotherhood to engage in a “Civilization-Jihad” wherein Muslims would work at “eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house.” He listed a number of American Muslim organizations, including CAIR, in an appendix to the memo.",
  "It would cripple the operations of any Muslim organizations linked, however circumstantially, to the Brotherhood.”\n\n“Demonizing these organizations,” she added, “will only hinder national security efforts to eradicate the roots of violent extremism.”\n\nNathan Lean, author of the 2012 book The Islamophobia Industry, agrees.",
  "stem largely from a single discredited document titled “An Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America.” The memorandum, found during a 2004 FBI raid of a Virginia home, was written by a Muslim Brotherhood member named Mohamed Akram Adlouni in 1991.",
  "“It certainly strikes one as similar to early twentieth-century anti-Semitic claims in the U.S. and Europe connecting any powerful Jew to ‘international Jewry,’ which both erases any sense of their legitimacy while feeding conspiracy theories that galvanize nativist support,” Gottschalk said.",
  "Asked about Gaffney’s assertion that the Muslim Brotherhood wants to commit “civilization jihad” in the West, Trager said “a group that couldn’t control Egypt for a year certainly couldn’t control America.”\n\nMasoud, the Harvard professor, identified a foreign policy downside to Cruz’s bill.",
  "But among anti-Muslim groups like the Center for Security Policy, which has close ties to Cruz, this document is still held up as definitive proof that peaceful Muslim groups in the U.S. are hellbent on committing “civilization jihad.”\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood Has Landed!",
  "Yet with the election of Donald Trump, who has surrounded himself with anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists, and with Republicans in control of the Senate and House, the proposed Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act has a chance of passing and being signed into law.",
  "A 2001 executive order issued by President George W. Bush gave the State and Treasury departments broad powers to investigate organizations that the government alleges have provided material support to, or are “otherwise associated with,” a designated terror group.",
  "— Eric Trager (@EricTrager18) December 23, 2016\n\nAs for Cruz’s bill, Trager said he sees what he called “a technical question more than anything.” The Muslim Brotherhood, he said, is better understood as a hate group than a terrorist organization.",
  "bragged in a Dec. 13 fundraising email that her group had a “direct line” to the Trump White House and that his presidency would be a “four-year window of opportunity” to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group, among other objectives.",
  "a seeming admission that these organizations were not, in fact, engaged in any “civilization jihad.”\n\nAdlouni does not appear to have been a significant player in the Muslim Brotherhood, so his letter can’t be interpreted as a set of orders.",
  "That’s hyperbole in a way, but that is the sort of the logical leap that these people make.”\n\nThe reality, Lean said, is that “there is never evidence” that CAIR or ISNA or the International Institute of Islamic Thought ?",
  "Peter Gottschalk, a professor of religion at Wesleyan University and co-author of the 2007 book “Islamophobia: Making Muslims the Enemy,” told HuffPost that Cruz’s bill hearkens back to dark chapters in American history.",
  "Rather, they argue, the legislation would enable the U.S. government to target domestic Muslim groups that Cruz and others earnestly believe are part of a massive, covert conspiracy to destroy the U.S. from within.",
  "Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\n\nNot every expert agrees that the effort to label the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group is merely a ploy to go after American Muslim organizations.",
  "“The bill is about domestic control of Muslims,” Corey Saylor, director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told The Huffington Post.",
  "But American foreign policy and counterterrorism experts, while highly critical of the brotherhood’s brand of Islamism, have generally not viewed the organization as a threat to U.S. national security.",
  "The Islamophobia Industry author Lean warned that if the U.S. declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group, it’s likely the government could launch “wholesale surveillance” of the Muslim community ?",
  "Berger, a counterterrorism analyst at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, told BuzzFeed last fall, speaking of the broader idea of a terrorist designation for the Muslim Brotherhood.",

  "And during his 2016 presidential campaign, his national security advisers included the Center for Security Policy’s founder and president, Frank Gaffney, and its vice president, Clare Lopez.",
  "CAIR, ISNA, and other Brotherhood front groups should be shaking in their boots.”\n\nThose who worry about the rights and safety of American Muslims have been less joyous since the election.",
  "They have argued that a terror designation might needlessly complicate U.S. relations with Middle Eastern countries where the brotherhood or its offshoots hold some level of influence.",

  "A bill introduced this week by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) calls on the U.S. State Department to determine whether the Muslim Brotherhood is a foreign terrorist organization.",
  "The alleged connections being drawn between groups like CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are “very shoddy,” according to Lean, the author of The Islamophobia Industry.",
  "“It doesn’t seem to me that the Muslim Brotherhood functions as an organization in a sense of command and control as it did in 2013 and prior,” said Trager.",
  "Additionally, a British government investigation last year determined that while the Muslim Brotherhood had ties to extremism, it was not a terrorist group.",
  "much as the New York Police Department once did, “which violated [Muslims’] rights.”\n\nAnd that, Lean suggested, would be the relatively “benign” outcome.",
  "Under the helm of Gaffney, the Center for Security Policy has arguably done more than any other group to push the “civilization jihad” conspiracy theory.",
  "as well as to groups like the Muslim American Society, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the International Institute of Islamic Thought ?",
  "to smear and potentially prosecute American Muslim advocacy groups, a move that could prove disastrous for the civil rights of Muslims in this country.",
  "Plus, there’s “no such thing as being a sort of Muslim Brother.” The process to become a member of the brotherhood is “very rigorous,” Trager said.",
