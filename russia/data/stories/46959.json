  "Cambridge Analytica executives have been recorded as bragging that their tactics won the election for Trump, and in the time since the election the firm has been the subject of a number of investigative reports, especially in the U.K.\n\nPerhaps the most damaging was an undercover investigation by the U.K.'s Channel 4 in which the firm's CEO, Alexander Nix, was caught on film bragging about its various underhanded tactics for winning elections for clients around the world and for claiming credit for Trump's victory, suggesting that Trump was little more than a puppet under the firm's control.",
  "The company then used that data to flood the internet with negative news stories about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, exploiting phrases it tested for their ability to arouse antipathy toward the candidate, such as “crooked Hillary.”\n\nMany of the terms tested by the firm and found to be effective against Clinton later became catchphrases and rallying cries of the Trump campaign, such as \"Drain the swap\" and \"deep state.\"",
  "Financing was provided by the Mercer family, big conservative donors, who envisioned Cambridge Analytica as a vehicle to develop a populist movement here in the U.S. in opposition to the liberal establishment of Washington, using the psychological profiling tools it created.",
  "In a statement it says:\n\n“Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.\"",
  "Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest, without permission, the personal data of as many as 87 million American Facebook users ahead of the 2016 elections, and it was able to do so because of lax controls on the part of Facebook.",
  "Cambridge Analytica is shutting down and filing for bankruptcy, according to various news reports, as is the elections division of SCL Group, the London-based political propaganda shop from which it was launched.",
  "Until just a few months ago, few Americans knew much about Cambridge Analytica, the shadowy British data firm that aided Donald Trump in winning the 2016 election.",
  "Nix was suspended in March and an investigation was launched by the company to determine whether any laws had been broken, eventually deciding none had.",
  "The Wall Street Journal reports that Nigel Oakes, who founded SCL in 1993, has confirmed that both firms are closing immediately.",
  "A key figure in the launch of Cambridge Analytica was Steve Bannon, then publisher of Breitbart News, the conservative website.",
  "Bannon later became Trump's campaign manager, and he brought Cambridge Analytica with him when he joined the campaign.",
  "The problem: a flight of clients since the Facebook scandal broke, as well as a slew of lawsuits.",
  "Nix bragged of entrapping clients' political opponents with bribes and sex.",
  "The firm denies that it has done anything illegal in its work for clients.",
  "Then the Facebook data scandal broke, and now a lot of people do.",
  "It’s not been good for business.",
  "That's no coincidence."
