  "It’s very important that we don’t upset our relations with Russia right now.” At the time, the Obama Administration had launched something called the “Russian reset.” This effectively meant that the Administration didn’t want to disturb Russia by imposing genuine consequences for prickly issues like human rights or the murder of Sergei Magnitsky.",
  "Sergei Magnitsky, my Russian lawyer, is my hero because he was a Russian patriot who stood up to and exposed a massive $230 million government corruption scheme enacted against the Russian people—which we have since traced to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s network.",
  "As I prepare to attend Senator McCain’s memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. on Saturday, remembering the humane and sympathetic way he addressed Sergei’s tragedy makes the senator’s passing even more heartbreaking.",
  "In a world where no legal mechanisms existed to right the wrong of Sergei Magnitsky’s death, John McCain became my hero by creating a new tool for bringing Sergei’s killers and other human rights abusers to justice.",
  "Because of the “reset,” the legislation encountered fierce resistance from the Obama Administration, but in Congress, Senator McCain’s gravitas and commitment to justice brought nearly everybody along.",
  "“Please continue.”\n\nThe meeting went on for a full hour and all of his subsequent meetings were pushed back so he could take the time to hear Sergei’s story from start to finish.",
  "He even went so far as to send an emissary to Trump Tower in June 2016 in an attempt to convince a future Trump administration that the Magnitsky Act should be repealed.",
  "Shortly after his re-election in May, 2012, he declared that it was his most important foreign policy priority to make sure that the Magnitsky Act never became law.",
  "This imposed asset freezes and visa sanctions on those who tortured and killed Sergei, as well as other Russians guilty of gross human rights violations.",
  "In retaliation, Sergei was arrested in 2008 and tortured in an attempt to get him to retract his testimony against corrupt Russian government officials.",
  "At the end, I asked whether he’d be willing to support the Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on the Russian officials who killed Sergei Magnitsky.",
  "The law allows the U.S. and other countries to freeze the assets and withhold the visas of people who are violating human rights in Russia.",
  "There are now 49 Russians on the Magnitsky sanctions list, many of whom were involved in Sergei’s false arrest, torture, and murder.",
  "His secretary came into the room to say his next appointment was ready, and I worried that my opportunity was already gone.",
  "I sat on the couch, and started telling him the story of Sergei’s whistleblowing and the horrific consequences he faced.",
  "He met me at the door of his office in the Russell Senate Office Building with a warm handshake and a hearty smile.",
  "Shortly after his murder in 2009, I went to Washington to tell Sergei Magnitsky’s story to whoever would listen.",
  "He said, “Of course I will,” adding that he’d do anything in his power to help get justice for Sergei Magnitsky.",
  "He refused to perjure himself and bear false witness, and for that he was killed in police custody in Moscow.",
  "Together with Democratic Senator Benjamin Cardin from Maryland, Senator McCain introduced the Magnitsky Act.",
  "In spite of the administration’s misgivings, it was signed into law by President Obama on December 14, 2012.",
  "The common response was, “That’s a terrible story, we’re so sorry, but there’s nothing we can do about it.",
  "But in the spring of 2010 I was lucky enough to get a 15-minute meeting with Senator McCain.",
  "Most important, we know how effective this legislation has been by Putin’s shrill reaction.",
  "In the end, when it came for a vote, it passed the Senate 92-4 and the House 365-43.",
  "Very quickly our 15 minutes were up and I was nowhere near finished with the story.",
  "This tool is known in the United States and around the world as the Magnitsky Act.",
  "“I need some more time with Mr. Browder,” the senator said softly.",
  "Since then, the Magnitsky Act has become an obsession of Putin’s.",
  "I have two heroes in the world: Sergei Magnitsky and John McCain.",
  "His secretary left and McCain turned his attention back to me.",
  "I was distraught by the brick wall that I’d encountered.",
  "He was so interested that he kept asking questions.",
  "But it did."
