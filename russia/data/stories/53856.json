  "In response to the revelation that Martin was in fact involved in the Daniels' proceedings, the Trump Organization released a statement to CNN saying she was doing so in her private capacity not as an official attorney in Trump world.",

  "Martin's involvement directly contradicts Cohen's previous assertion that \"neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms.",
