  "You bet.”\n\nBannon marveled that Gaffney and his Center for Security Policy are so often targeted for abuse in the media and dismissed as alarmist “screwballs,” when their solid research is ultimately repeated by mainstream outlets like the Wall Street Journal months or years later, driven by unfolding news events like the Texas lawsuit.",
