  "A blockbuster New York Times story published last week detailing Facebook’s behind-the-scenes efforts to downplay and deny a string of recent controversies, including the Cambridge Analytica data breach and Russian disinformation, placed fresh scrutiny on the 34-year-old tech executive and others in power at Facebook, including chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.",
  "“What we’re talking about in these circumstances is Mark Zuckerberg listening to his investors and listening to voices from Wall Street that are encouraging him to do what’s good for him, for the company, for American democracy, and for the company’s users, and build in an independent board chair and then start rebuilding some trust.”",
  "Zuckerberg gets most of Facebook’s shareholder votes\n\nShareholders in stocks of publicly traded companies have a certain set of rights related to that investment, including the right to vote on certain corporate matters, such as members of the board of directors, proposed mergers and acquisitions, or executive pay packages.",
  "“It might sound good with a charismatic founder, but in the long run, it’s bad for investors.”\n\nZuckerberg might not be the problem at Facebook, but it’s not clear he’s got a solution\n\nAll this isn’t to say that Facebook has been a bad investment — it went public at $38 per share, and it’s now trading at about $140.",

  "As Pisani at CNBC pointed out, Rupert Murdoch and his family have all the voting power at News Corp. At Google, there are three classes of stock, but the B shares controlled by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt account for some 60 percent of voting shares.",
  "“They do have some near-term problems.”\n\nBut given Facebook’s stream of missteps and apologies, essentially since its inception, it’s difficult not to wonder whether bringing about at least some sort of leadership change at Facebook might make a difference.",
  "“For a long time, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, they’ve thought of Facebook as being something special and something different, so they didn’t need to play by the same rules as everybody else, and we’re starting to see that’s not true,” he said.",
  "The Times story describes board member Erskine Bowles, who heads Facebook’s Oversight & Risk Committee, as having “pelted questions” at Zuckerberg and Sandberg over their knowledge of Russian interference, indicating some unrest on the board.",
  "“That’s clear as day.”\n\nShareholders have asked for changes to Facebook’s corporate governance before, and they’re doing it now too\n\nShareholders of publicly traded companies are usually provided a handful of proposals to vote on each year.",
  "On a call with reporters last week in the wake of the Times story, Zuckerberg was asked whether anyone at Facebook would lose their jobs over what the Times account says happened — or whether he’ll give up some of the control he holds.",
  "Even before the latest scandals, there have been questions about whether too much influence within Facebook has been placed with Zuckerberg and, among some investors, pushes for him to renounce his position as chair of the board.",

  "ISS said this year that two of its recent studies found that companies with a multi-class structure “generally underperformed” companies without that structure in three-, five-, and 10-year periods.",
  "Borrus told me growing academic research suggests that when companies go public, the multi-class structure might at first give them a boost, but that fades to a discount within six to nine years.",
  "The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Zuckerberg earlier this year told top executives at Facebook that the company was at war, and his approach has caused turmoil within the company.",
  "It’s been a rough year for Facebook, which has been dogged by scandal and controversy, and the past week of events at the Menlo Park, California-based company has been among its worst yet.",
  "Borrus, from CII, told me that about 10 percent of publicly listed companies have a multi-class share setup, but the proportion is growing among newly public companies, especially in tech.",
  "Facebook has also pointed out that its dual-class structure has been in place since 2009, well before it first went public in 2012, and investors who bought the Class A shares knew that.",
  "“He has the votes under [the current] structure, and nothing’s going to change.”\n\nThis isn’t unique to Facebook\n\nOutsize control given to corporate executives isn’t unique to Facebook.",
  "“These are very credible, highly serious investors, putting their names and credibility behind the shareholder proposal and encouraging their fellow investors to vote for it,” he said.",
  "That means that whatever shareholders are voting on — typically at Facebook’s annual meeting, usually in May — Zuckerberg and those closest to him are always going to win out.",
  "Zuckerberg’s fate as chair of Facebook “isn’t up to anyone but him,” Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.",
  "Zuckerberg has steered the company through some tough times, and Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, has been seen as a sort of adult in the room and a steady hand.",
  "He reiterated the point in an interview with CNN Business this week, saying that stepping down as chairman is “not the plan.”\n\nAnd the thing is, no one can make him.",
  "In 2018, for example, shareholders proposed putting in place a one-vote-per-share setup and implementing reports on fake news controversies and the gender pay gap.",
  "But because of the way Facebook’s shareholder structure is set up — and the number of shares Zuckerberg holds — there’s no way for anyone to force him out.",

  "CII recently petitioned the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to sunset multi-class structures within seven years of an initial public offering.",

  "“For the board composition, I don’t think that that specific proposal is the right way to go,” he said.",
  "Facebook’s board could, conceivably, revolt, like Uber’s board did with former CEO Travis Kalanick.",
  "Some of those proposals are put forth by the company’s management, and others by shareholders.",

  "A similar proposal in 2017, which ISS backed, failed.",
  "In 2005, it was just 1 percent, Borrus said.",
  "He’s the only one who can make the decision.",
  "Zuckerberg alone controls about 60 percent.",
  "And every Class B share gets 10 votes.",
  "That doesn’t mean it will pass.",
  "ISS came out in favor of them.",
  "They all failed."
