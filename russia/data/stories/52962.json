  "Among them: Robert Zarate, now the foreign policy adviser to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who now runs a Washington consultancy; and Jason Thielman, the chief of staff to Montana Sen. Steve Daines.",

  "\"They're still very active — in making preparations at least — to influence public opinion again,\" said Feike Hacquebord, a security researcher at Trend Micro Inc. who authoered the report.",
  "Like many cybersecurity companies, Trend Micro refuses to speculate publicly on who is behind such groups, referring to Pawn Storm only as having \"Russia-related interests.\"",
