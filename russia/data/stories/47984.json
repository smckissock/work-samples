  "“Facebook was not a failure of security, it was a failure of maturity or ethics — whereas Equifax was negligent in terms of a failure of information security.”\n\nWhen asked what people can do to prevent their data from being harvested without their direct knowledge, security technologist Bruce Schneier’s answer was chillingly straightforward.",
  "But while all the attacks ultimately have the same end result — people’s personal information is put at risk — there is a big difference between companies being hacked by third parties (Uber, Target, Equifax) and companies voluntarily sharing information with or selling information to third parties (Facebook).",
  "Companies get away with using mandated disclosures for two reasons: There are no federal laws preventing them from requiring it and because the average person doesn’t read dozens of pages of fine print to make sure a company will not surreptitiously profit off of them.",
  "The recent data-sharing controversy surrounding Facebook and its failure to prevent improper data harvesting by Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the ways both corporate data sharing and corporate hacks affect ordinary people’s lives.",
  "“These brokers collect demographic information: names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, marital status, profession, income level, political affiliation … they collect lists of things we’ve purchased, when we’ve purchased them, and how we paid for them.",
  "Because there are no laws preventing companies from doing this, you are essentially helpless when it comes to preventing the sale of your own data even if you are meticulous about avoiding entering important information on computers or phones, according to experts.",
  "And it’s a legal business model.”\n\nWhat he means is that when you sign up for services like Uber or Facebook, you’re usually prompted to accept that company’s terms and conditions by checking off an “I have read and agree” box, otherwise you can’t use the service.",
  "Schneider pointed the finger at Uncle Sam, saying the U.S. has no laws in place to regulate data brokerage companies and what is known as “surveillance capitalism,” a new kind of business model in which corporations profit off of people’s personal data.",
  "Krebs says he’s hopeful innovations like blockchain technology will eventually put credit bureaus and data brokers out of business in favor of an approach that gives consumers more control over their financial lives, but he’s not holding his breath.",
  "A prime example of how this opaque business model serves the financial interests of corporations at the expense of Americans’ personal information is 2017’s massive Equifax hack, which exposed the data of nearly 148 million Americans.",
  "There have been dozens of major corporate hacks in the past few years, ranging from headline-grabbing hacks like the Uber data breach that exposed 57 million customers’ information, to breaches at LinkedIn, Target, JPMorgan and more.",
  "(To be clear, it’s still a good idea to follow cybersecurity best practices like using complex passwords, never repeating the same password for different services, and using two-factor authentication whenever possible.)",
  "Most people think of Equifax as a regular credit reporting agency, but it is also a data broker, and that’s the part of their business where they make the most money (and where the data breach actually happened).",
  "For now, Krebs said as long as people continue to check the “I agree to the terms and conditions” box with these companies, data will still continue to be legally collected by every company and service you use.",
  "And he says the only way consumers can take control of their personal information to prevent it from being used by companies to make profits is by demanding change at the legal and regulatory level.",
  "This concept is called mandated disclosure, and it’s inherently problematic for consumers because you’re required to sign away your rights to your own information in order to engage with a product.",
  "These types of companies mitigate the risks of this furtive data brokering by making it a requirement for consumers to agree to their legal terms and conditions, in order to use their services.",
  "“Until some innovative company comes along and dis-intermediates these companies, I don’t see anything changing,” said Brian Krebs, a security expert and independent investigative journalist.",
  "It also sells your personal data — including your social security number — to private companies that have nothing to do with credit reports for pure profit, without telling you or asking you.",
  "In the case of Equifax, the company would have had to put in minimal effort to secure your data, Bas van Schaik, a researcher at analytics security firm Semmle, told Wired in September.",
  "They spend a significant amount of time and money focusing on not being breached,” said Michael Borohovski, co-founder of Tinfoil Security, a company that monitors website security.",
  "If you’re one of the millions of Americans feeling like it’s time to start better protecting your personal data, you’re pretty much out of luck, according to cybersecurity experts.",
  "Specifically, they can freeze their credit reports, get regular copies of their credit report and call to complain when they see something on their report that shouldn’t be there.",
  "“It collects information about all of us, analyzes it all, and then sells those insights.”\n\n“The breadth and depth of information that data brokers have is astonishing,” he says.",
  "You can try to “opt-out” and tell Equifax that you don’t want your data collected, but it will still collect it anyway — and your data won’t actually get deleted, Schneier says.",
  "MONEY talked to a handful of cybersecurity experts and all of them agreed people have little to no power over their personal information once it’s in the hands of a third party.",
  "The ongoing Facebook scandal is just one of many incidents related to data overreaches and breaches that have recently jeopardized millions of Americans’ personal information.",
  "Even after the breach became public knowledge, the Internal Revenue Service still awarded Equifax with a $7.25 million dollar contract for personal identification services.",
  "“I tell people be really careful about the information that you give away whether it’s on social networking on the internet to marketing companies to surveys,” Krebs said.",
  "(To check how consumer-friendly a terms and service agreement is before you sign it, Borohovski recommends using the website tosdr.org, which spells out users’ rights).",
  "They collect everything about what we do on the Internet.”\n\nEquifax isn’t just an average company that provides you, the consumer, with one free credit report a year.",
  "History has shown that companies like Equifax responsible for some of the most egregious recent lapses in corporate responsibility aren’t facing many consequences.",
  "Rather, it’s incentivized to serve the banks and retailers that pay it millions of dollars for the information they have collected on you without your knowledge.",
  "A lot of people have kind of given up,” trying to protect their data, he said, assuming there is nothing they can do to stay in control of their information.",
  "“Their business model is collecting your data without your knowledge and consent and selling it to companies who want to manipulate you with it,” he said.",
  "That is your only option.”\n\nSchneier argues that these non-consensual data grabs aren’t a bug inside corporate data collections — they are a feature.",
  "But ultimately, there is not one action people can take that will prevent companies from collecting their information without their direct knowledge.",
  "At this point, virtually no industry remains untouched by hackers, who usually steal consumer data for financial gain by selling it on the dark web.",
  "Another potentially worrying aspect of these widespread cyber attacks is the lack of sophistication required to carry them out, experts said.",
  "These companies “deliberately hide their actions and make it difficult for consumers to learn about or control their data,” Schneier said.",
  "“When was the last time you clicked ‘I agree’ to these terms and conditions check box and actually read the terms?” Borohovski said.",
  "The information lost includes everything from names and contact information to more sensitive data, like social security numbers.",
  "And real regulatory changes that would help safeguard people’s personal information may not be on the horizon anytime soon.",
  "Experts told MONEY people can do a few things to have a little more control over their financial information.",
  "And it if they get a fine, it’ll be a fine that was cheaper than the lawyer fees,” Schneier said.",
  "“You live in the United States and the United States doesn’t regulate surveillance capitalism.",
  "Why is it so hard to protect your personal data from being collected without your knowledge?",
  "“Comparing Facebook to Equifax, Facebook takes significant effort to avoid being breached.",
  "And signing it makes whatever that company decides to do with your data completely legal.",
  "“Invariably this information you give away about yourself is used to profile you.”",
  "Your data can be bought and sold without your knowledge and consent.",
  "They keep track of deaths, divorces, and diseases in our families.",
  "So there’s not much I can do to protect my personal information?",
  "Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
  "Therefore, Equifax has no incentive to protect your data.",
  "It’s a data broker,” Schneier explains on his website.",
  "That’s the fundamental problem with this,” he said.",
  "“If you don’t like that, lobby your congressman.",
  "“Equifax is more than a credit reporting agency.",
  "Who is safe from this type of data collection?",
  "So what exactly does that mean for consumers?",
  "And those people aren’t entirely wrong.",
  "You are the product, not the client.",
  "That’s the way it works,” he said.",
  "“Check back in a year – nothing.",
  "“I do that, most people don’t.",
  "“That’s their business model.",
  "And he’s not the only one.",
  "The short answer: no one.",
  "“You can’t do anything."
