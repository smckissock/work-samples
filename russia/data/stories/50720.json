  "He said there was one thing Trump could do on his first day in office that would make a huge difference: “Designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.”\n\n“The second thing that I would argue he should begin doing on Day One, which will take a little while to effect, but he needs to get started on: you know, he’s talked a lot over the course of the campaign, and since he was elected, about his commitment to improving the infrastructure of our country,” Gaffney continued.",
  "Gaffney said Trump’s nomination of retired Marine General James Mattis for secretary of defense “continues a pattern the President-elect set so far, of serious, thoughtful, clearly extraordinarily capable people – in fact, patriots – who have the ability to make major course corrections in their respective areas of responsibility, something the President-elect is clearly committed to.”\n\n“He ran on it, and nowhere arguably as importantly as with respect to the national security.",
  "I very much hope he’ll take people that have calibrated properly the enemies we face – in particular, not exclusively, but in particular, this global jihad movement, and understand that we need to fight, as he will have them swear to do, ‘all enemies foreign and domestic.’ Because there is a very important element of that, as you know, with respect to these Islamic supremacists right here at home,” Gaffney said.",
  "America’s back.’ I think that was a very important signal.”\n\n“The second thing is that I’m reminded of nothing so much as the hysteria that was the response of the political elites, here and elsewhere around the world, to Ronald Reagan announcing that he thought it would be better to send American’s lives than avenge them, and set off on the idea of exploring a missile defense,” Gaffney continued.",
  "I believe it was an enormously important step towards taking down the Soviets without firing a shot.”\n\n“My hope is that this will be part of a larger strategy by the President-elect, when in office, to create conditions under which the Chinese, as well, cease to be the sort of threat to us, to our interests, to our allies in the region, that they clearly are bent on becoming,” he said.",
  "The sentiment against war, and against military expenditures, and involvement in what was already beginning then to unfold in Europe and in Asia, was so intense.”\n\n“They read that as weakness, as irresolution, as essentially an opportunity to assert themselves and obtain the resources that they desperately needed to build the Empire of Japan.",
  "“As with you, Matt, my thoughts go out to all those who suffered, whose lives were upended, in some cases, actually terminated, on this terrible day 75 years ago – and the many, many millions of others who, in the period shortly before that and subsequent to it, perished in the course of World War II,” said Gaffney.",

  "I think we were, in the form of this conversation Donald Trump had with the President of Taiwan, signaling unmistakably to the Communist Chinese, who endlessly threaten Taiwan and insist they’re going to take it back by force at some point: ‘Don’t even think about it.",
  "“It was really the most horrific conflagration in human history.”\n\n“Besides that, my thoughts are: Pearl Harbor was really an object lesson in the imperative of America practicing what my old boss Ronald Reagan used to call ‘peace through strength,’” he continued.",
  "There are other rivals, including two Asian powers today – Communist China and Vladimir Putin’s Russia – that I fear are making similar calculations, and perhaps with similar designs on our interests and equities, as well,” Gaffney warned.",
  "As he rebuilds that electric grid to protect it against enemies foreign and domestic, and indeed against naturally occurring phenomena, he needs to build into it resiliency.”\n\n“I think he gets that.",

  "He explicitly said – as you know so well, Matt – he committed himself to restoring our practice of peace through strength,” he recalled.",
  "I hope we’ll see that in his selections in the State Department, and at the Department of Homeland Security.”\n\n“I’ve got candidates.",
  "“And not least, we had very, very narrowly, I think by a one-vote margin, actually, succeeded in passing the draft through Congress.",
  "“Two points: One, the old line from the very founding of this Republic, ‘the shot heard round the world,’” Gaffney replied.",
  "“And as you know, Matt, the single most critical part of our critical infrastructure is our electric grid.",
