  "The intelligence agencies, according to Lawrence, did not even examine the DNC’s computers, an omission he calls “beyond preposterous,” and instead relied on a third-party report from Crowdstrike, a non-profit co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, described as “vigorously anti-Russian.” The “high confidence” in Russian culpability we heard of again and again in mainstream media reporting is an “evasive term” and “how officials avoid putting their names on the assertions we are so strongly urged to accept.”\n\nSome conservatives are already lauding Lawrance’s report and the work of VIPS as a final vindication of their skepticism.",
  "Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning, for example, issued the following statement Thursday:\n\nIf the whole premise of the [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller investigation, that Russia hacked the DNC emails interfering with the elections, is in fact false and it was a DNC insider as the Nation reports former NSA officials contending, there is simply no rationale for the special counsel to continue investigating the Russia angle.",
  "Now, according to the research by the experts Lawrence cites — the group Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) — a Russian government cyberattack on the DNC’s computers is likely not a “possibility.” The group has examined several aspects of the emails’ journey to the public eye and concluded it cannot be made to comport with a hacker in the former Soviet Union.",
  "Author Patrick Lawrence assembles the findings of months of investigation by forensic computer experts and former NSA officials to conclude, quite categorically, what Breitbart News and other independent media outlets have suggested for nearly a year: there was no hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by the Russian government or anyone else last summer.",
  "“James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, admitted in May that ‘hand-picked’ analysts from three agencies (not the 17 previously reported) drafted the ICA,” he writes, pointing out that not even the whole of the three agencies cited (the FBI, NSA, and CIA) were involved but only a few staffers “hand-picked” by Clapper.",
  "With actual evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign now looking increasingly unlikely to come to light, there are increasing indications Mueller’s investigation has shifted to looking for financial crimes allegedly committed by President Trump and his family long before and far outside the presidential campaign.",
  "It became clear through the testimony of Investor William Browder that Fusion GPS, the research firm that assembled for a still unknown client the infamous, perverse 2016 dossier describing now-President Trump asking Russian prostitutes to urinate for his pleasure, had, in fact, worked for the Russian government in the past.",
  "As Breitbart News’s Joel Pollak wrote last month, the “DNC Hack,” now better known as the “DNC Leak,” the term originally used in these pages, is not the only pillar of the Russia collusion narrative to face collapse as the media hysteria passes its first anniversary.",
  "Metadata also indicate that the emails were taken by someone in the Eastern Daylight Timezone and then deliberately copy-and-pasted into a Microsoft Word file that had its language settings changed to Russian in a ruse to throw off investigators.",
  "He writes:\n\nAll this was set in motion when the DNC’s mail server was first violated in the spring of 2016 and by subsequent assertions that Russians were behind that “hack” and another such operation, also described as a Russian hack, on July 5.",
  "Shortly after the emails became public, Julian Assange, whose Wikileaks played a major role in the emails’ dissemination, claimed Russia played no role, but this did nothing to stem the flood of assurances about a Russian hack.",
  "A bombshell report published Wednesday by avowedly liberal news magazine The Nation may have put the last nail in the coffin of the “Russian hack” narrative that has dominated the mainstream media’s coverage for the last year.",
  "Calling the supposed hack and the continual allegations of collusion by President Donald Trump and his associates a “great edifice,” Lawrence points to the central role the “DNC Hack” plays in the “Russiagate” narrative.",
  "“There’s no evidence out there to get me to change my mind.” When I asked Edward Loomis, a 90 percent man, about the 10 percent he held out, he replied, “I’ve looked at the work and it shows there was no Russian hack.",
  "Any suggestion otherwise is false and is just another conspiracy theory like those pushed by Trump and his administration,” Adrienne Watson, the DNC’s deputy communications director told Breitbart News Thursday.",
  "The only prosecutions that can flow from that investigation must be of Obama administration officials who covered up the real facts surrounding the DNC emails, setting the nation off on this new red scare.",
  "The Nation, a leading publication of the American left for over a century, may seem an unlikely place for such a thorough refutation of one of the Democratic Party’s most salient talking points.",
  "Some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders saw in the emails a DNC plot to support eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, dealing a blow to Democratic unity in the runup to the party’s convention.",
  "Presumably this ICA, quoted for months in the mainstream media as being the work of “all 17” American intelligence agencies, is the basis of the DNC’s continued claims of a Russian hack.",
  "The “17 intelligence agencies” line, a fixture of pro-Russiagate media since Hillary Clinton used the figure in her second presidential debate performance, was and is fake news.",
  "The central text of the Russiagate gospel became the “Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA)” issued in January of this year, days before President Barack Obama left office.",
  "I’m a scientist.”\n\nNothing in the report, however, dissuaded the DNC from its conviction the Russians are responsible for the publication of their internal communications.",
  "An internal leaker is a much more likely source of the confidential internal DNC emails that upended the presidential campaign season when they became public last June.",
  "If Mueller is unwilling to go where the evidence leads, in this case to the DNC itself and the Obama administration cover-up, then he is not fit to serve.",
  "The Nation’s story is by no means the first indication something might be awry with the “official version” of what happened at the DNC last summer.",
  "The evolution of public discourse in the year since is worthy of scholarly study: Possibilities became allegations, and these became probabilities.",
  "The reality, as the New York Times finally admitted in June, was that only three intelligence agencies participated in the creation of the ICA.",
  "Lawrance writes:\n\nAll those interviewed came in between 90 percent and 100 percent certain that the forensics prove out.",
  "It is incumbent upon the Justice Department to determine and settle once and for all the true source of the DNC emails.",
  "intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government hacked the DNC in an attempt to interfere in the election.",
  "Then the probabilities turned into certainties, and these evolved into what are now taken to be established truths.",
  "The impact of the revelations unearthed by the VIPS team and The Nation on that investigation have yet to be seen.",
  "The files apparently were transferred to a data storage device at a speed not possible over the internet.",
  "“It’s QED, theorem demonstrated,” William Binney said in response to my question.",
  "I have already quoted Skip Folden’s answer: impossible based on the data.",
  "“The laws of physics don’t lie,” Ray McGovern volunteered at one point.",
  "In Mueller’s case, this is either obstruction or willful blindness.",
  "The conclusions of four of VIPS’s investigators was unanimous.",
  "These are the foundation stones of the edifice just outlined.",
  "Lawrence’s piece further takes the ICA to task.",
  "Lawrence, however, is strikingly forthright.",
  "But I didn’t do the work.",
  "That’s the 10 percent.",
  "“U.S."
