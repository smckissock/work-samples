  "Make America Number 1 paid more than $950,000 to Conway’s polling firm, including payments issued after Conway began working for Trump’s campaign, though she told POLITICO last month: “There was no overlap for me, even though that would have been legally permitted.”\n\nNonetheless, the nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, in a complaint to the FEC, flagged the work by Conway’s firm for the super PAC and the Trump campaign, as well as a $15,000 payment by Make America Number 1 to a video production company owned by Bannon called Glittering Steel and the payments by the super PAC and campaign to Cambridge Analytica.",

  "And the family has given to entities that espouse non-interventionist foreign policies (more than $25 million to the Koch brothers’ network and $300,000 to the Cato Institute), but also more than $4 million to groups associated with Bolton, the hawkish former diplomat who has called President Barack Obama \"one of the most narcissistic individuals to ever hold that job\" and who suggested that the Obama administration might \"reinstitute blasphemy laws\" to limit criticism of Islam.",
  "While it’s accurate to characterize the Mercers anti-establishment “in the shorthand,” Bozell said “it is a much, much deeper philosophical belief than that.” Rebekah and Bob Mercer “see the establishment as a very real threat to freedom in America, and they see the need to defeat it,” Bozell said, adding that “in all the causes that they have supported … my guess is that you won’t find any of them who have said that they asked for anything.",
  "And how many donors can you say that for?”\n\nA handful of GOP digital operatives argued that there are strings attached to groups that receive Mercer cash — they are expected to retain Cambridge Analytica, a relative newcomer to the GOP tech scene that specializes in building nontraditional “psychographic” modeling of voters and donors, and even debate opponents.",
  "Beyond Mercer’s own direct line to Trump, she played a pivotal role in persuading him to bring into his inner-most circle several close allies whose efforts her family has financed to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, including incoming White House senior counselor Steve Bannon and top campaign officials Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie.",
  "The company was paid $17.2 million during the 2016 race by a handful of campaigns or committees funded partly by the Mercers, including Bolton’s super PAC, Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign (which the Mercers backed before switching to Trump), as well as Trump’s campaign and a family-run super PAC that similarly supported Cruz, then Trump.",

  "Even before Trump stunned the world by defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in this month’s presidential election, Mercer had left an imprint on the rookie politician’s team that rivaled that of almost any other member of Trump’s inner circle, save for Trump’s adult children and son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
  "Noting a campaign profile that said Mercer “exemplifies a new breed of activist donors,” the complaint asserted that the Mercer family’s super PAC was “inextricably intertwined with the Trump campaign.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized John Bolton’s views on Islam.",
  "Sessions in very high regard.”\n\nThe associate said that Mercer’s involvement on Trump’s transition team, which represents her first formal foray into government, “is based on her love of America and her belief that we’re in a serious situation and that people's freedoms are being eroded.",
