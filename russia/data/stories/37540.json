  "We believe this new ownership structure will allow Apollo Education Group to continue to transform University of Phoenix, further expand our global operations, drive operational efficiency and serve as the leading provider of high-quality education for working adults.”\n\nThe buyout, however, likely ends a key chapter in the corporate life of the University of Phoenix.",
  "Perhaps equally worrisome, Apollo Education was facing an expiring credit line, a recent $70 million loss in business value and a worsening score the U.S. Department of Education uses to permit access to taxpayer-backed student loans, which account for the bulk of company revenues.",
  "(Photo: John Samora, John Samora/The Republic)\n\nPHOENIX — After nearly 22 years as a publicly traded company, shareholders of the parent to the University of Phoenix approved a $1.14 billion sale Friday that hands the for-profit school over to a trio of private investors.",
