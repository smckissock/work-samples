  "Here are the song's lyrics, written about Tyrion and Shae:\n\nHe rode through the streets of the city, Down from his hill on high, O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's sigh.",
  "A singer named Symon Silver Tongue befriended Shae and tried to blackmail Tyrion into helping him sing at the royal wedding â€” or else he'd sing a song about Tyrion and Shae for all the world to hear.",
  "HBO\n\nIn the books, Tyrion keeps his lover Shae in a house in King's Landing (not inside the Red Keep as Sansa's handmaid).",
  "For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm.",
  "And a chain and a keep are nothing, Compared to a woman's kiss.",
  "For she was his secret treasure, She was his shame and bliss.",
  "This meant Tyrion would travel from the keep to her manse.",
  "The lyrics for \"Hands of Gold\" are very important."
