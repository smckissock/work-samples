  "Around 270,000 people downloaded MyDigitalLife, giving Cambridge Analytica a backdoor to their data and that of all their friends, more than 50 million other people who, according to Facebook, “had their privacy settings set to allow it.”\n\nA former contractor with Cambridge Analytica revealed how the data mining worked to The Observer and New York Times: “With their profiles, likes, even private messages, [Cambridge Analytica] could build a personality profile on each person and know how best to target them with messages,” said the former contractor, Christopher Wylie in a video interview with The Guardian.",
  "Trump didn’t pay very much for Cambridge Analytica’s services when he hired them, Nix admitted, adding, “He’s a good businessman.”\n\nWhat Nix didn’t say during his tense interview with Forbes, and what has transpired over the weekend from reports in The Observer and The New York Times, is that Cambridge Analytica had siphoned profile data from more than 50 million users of Facebook, in most cases without their knowledge, ahead of its work on Trump’s campaign.",
  "He would often start his answers with a defensive-sounding, “look.”\n\nWhen asked about where the company’s headquarters were and that of its parent company, SLC, he mumbled that journalists were “coming in here with their suppositions,” then added, curtly, “It’s an affiliate.”\n\nFor the head of one of the most notorious data analytics firms in the world, Nix worked from a modest office.",
  "Nix, whose regularly unguarded comments got him featured in a British television news expose on Monday that touched on bribes and sex workers, had quickly segued to an anecdote: “Last night I was at a dinner with some people who own newspapers,” he said, “They were saying why they didn’t like Steve Bannon.",
  "Some time in 2014, his company Cambridge Analytica secretly collected data from tens of millions of Facebook users, and used it to persuade many of them to vote for Donald Trump as President, according to multiple reports over the weekend citing an ex-contractor.",
  "In it, he explained in vague, sometimes evasive terms about how his company honed its data-driven marketing technology on Ted Cruz’s primary campaign, and then conducted \"attitudinal surveys\" across the United States to help Trump win the election.",
  "“Trump became the villain,\" he said, \"so now we’re the villain.”\n\nNix went on to boast about the data science credentials of his team, saying that only four of his workforce of 200 were “creatives.” “Everyone has got a masters and PhD’s,” he said.",
  "“My PA has got a masters.”\n\nDuring a brief tour of the company’s open-plan office, Nix showed off two of his data scientists, who sat side-by-side in the company’s open-plan office gazing at vertically-tipped screens.",
  "One had been on the company's front-line profiling team in Austin, Texas and during the night of the Presidential election, was busy feeding the system information about how the American electorate were voting.",
  "Papers were arranged neatly on his desk, including a letter from House & Garden magazine, while a copy of Time with Donald Trump on the cover was the only overt reference to Nix’s most famous client.",
  "“Look, fundamentally the more you know about someone, the better you can communicate with them at a human level, or a mass-communication-advertising level.”\n\nNix knows a lot, about a lot of people.",
  "“You’re going to to piss a lot of people off.”\n\nToday’s criticisms have little to do with who Nix helped bring into the White House, though, and everything to do with how it mined voter data.",
  "“None of the vendors wanted to work with Trump,” he said, referring to other analytics firms for political campaigns that, he suggested, were regularly giving kickbacks to politicians.",
  "Cambridge Analytica says it complied and deleted the data, but reports in the last few days from The New York Times, Wired and The Guardian/Observer, suggest it didn’t.",
  "We didn’t sign a contract.”\n\nNix became most animated when complaining about his company's sullied reputation, and how Trump’s victory should have vindicated its work.",
  "Billed as a “research app used by psychologists” and designed by a Cambridge academic, it promised to help users better understand their own personalities.",
  "“The big mystery of Big Data,” said Alexander Nix, “is causation versus correlation.”\n\nHe paused and looked out of the second-story window of his office.",
  "Well then!”\n\nFor Nix, it was hard not to take criticism personally, but he admitted this was part of the win-lose job of working on political campaigns.",
  "His interview with Forbes took place in March 2017, when we recorded him for our weekly technology podcast, an interview you can listen to again here.",
  "“We have wealthy investors, so we don’t need to take bribes,” he added, referring to his firm’s primary backer, hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer.",
  "It’s how they start to think differently.”\n\nSuch details from Wylie now cast a new and uncomfortable light on Cambridge Analytica’s methods.",
  "When Nix spoke to Forbes he took issue with reports that his firm used a method called psychographic profiling to target American voters.",
  "Beside them, a white board was filled with mathematical formulas while a poster bearing the Trump / Pence logo hung on the other wall.",
  "“What you’re susceptible to, and how many times we need to touch you with that to change your mind on something,” Wylie explained.",
  "When asked about Cambridge Analytica’s reported work for the Leave.Eu campaign for Brexit, Nix flatly denied any involvement.",
  "It’s very difficult for too many people to claim credit on the Trump campaign because there weren’t too many people involved.",
  "“This was not a campaign that was driven by psychographics and certainly not used in the creative engagement,” he said.",
  "It was filled with signatures of people from the Trump campaign team, and balanced on top was a small American flag.",
  "A yellow sticky note on his office phone had the words “Bannon” and “Lobbying” scrawled across it, each underlined.",
  "He had thick, black-rimmed spectacles and dirty-blonde, wavy hair that he occasionally smoothed over with his hand.",
  "Hillary had about 800 working for her.”\n\nDespite the company’s success, it’s reputation had suffered.",
  "That's an issue that goes beyond politics, and one that will likely haunt Nix for some time to come.",
  "Dark smudges lined the wall behind him, and the old MacBook he was typing on had smudges on its lid.",
  "He had the air of a busy executive, typing on his MacBook while occasionally answering questions.",
  "Facebook says that in 2015 it told the firm to destroy the user data it had secretly scraped.",
  "On the street below, red, double-decker buses snaked around a corner through London traffic.",
  "“We didn’t do Brexit,” he answered, while moving to type something into his MacBook again.",
  "The overall impression was that this was not a particularly enjoyable look place to work.",
  "The company did this by posting a survey app on Facebook called MyDigitalLife,” in 2014.",
  "Back in his office, Nix was asked about Trump's campaign strategist, Steve Bannon.",
  "“If you help one candidate win, you’re going to piss the other one off,” he said.",
  "“I talked to him everyday for five years,” he said, without elaborating.",
  "When we joined the Trump campaign, there were 30 people in Trump Tower.",
  "Then they see that and they click it and they go down the rabbit hole.",
  "What was his reaction to criticisms that his methods didn’t even work?",
  "He lightly tapped a Swiss Army knife on his desk and continued.",
  "Nix was trim and wore a dark-blue vest and black-and-gold tie.",
  "Pressed into another corner was a old, wooden foosball table.",
  "Had Bannon been a board member of Cambridge Analytica?",
  "“Success has many fathers and failure is an orphan.",
  "I said, ‘Have you met him?’ They said, 'No.'",
  "He then leaned back in his office chair.",
  "“We created content, websites and blogs.",
  "“We didn’t get money for it.",
  "We didn’t do work for it.",
  "“Look.” Nix sighed.",
  "Nix nodded."
