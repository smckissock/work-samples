  "Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News that during the early weeks of the Trump presidency a large number of analysts warned that the move was, “ill-advised,” arguing that the move “would alienate the Muslim world and encumber diplomacy.”\n\nSchanzer, a former terrorism finance official at the Treasury Department, said he does not believe the administration has given up on designation of the Brotherhood but he suggested it would be easier to target certain Brotherhood groups through the U.S. Treasury’s targeted sanctions program.",
  "“The White House completely understands how the modern global jihadi threat, which the president has rightly described as radical Islamic terrorism, can be driven back at its roots to the Brotherhood.”\n\n“This president is unprepared to follow the disastrous policies of prior administrations, especially the Obama White House’s empowering of the Brotherhood that led to the catastrophic consequences of the so-called Arab Spring and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from the Sinai to Sinjar,” the official concluded.",
  "“If you have Saudi Arabia saying the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist group, if you have Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) saying it’s a terrorist group, then what should stop the U.S. from designating the MB as a terrorist group as long there are hundreds of pieces of evidence that prove this fact?”\n\nThe Brotherhood is banned as a terrorist organization in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt.",
  "“The State Department will remain opposed…the Muslim Brotherhood is not a homogeneous organization, rather, it is made up of disparate affiliates, some of which could likely be classified as terror groups, and some not.”\n\n“The right move is to pursue these designations in the less-politicized Treasury process in a way that is incremental and pragmatic.",
  "As the Egyptian ambassador well knows, the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood are identical to those of all the jihadist organizations, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda and Hamas: the establishment of an Islamic state ruled by Sharia.”\n\nHolton blamed what he called “The Swamp in the State Department” for stopping the designation so far.",
  "The Muslim Brotherhood has been identified, rightly, as a threat by the countries that know it best -- like Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia -- among others.”\n\n“These countries understand that the MB isn't just another political or religious movement,” Reaboi added.",
  "Salman Al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Affairs Committee, told Fox News that the West is suffering from “laziness and must do its homework.”\n\n“The U.S. needs to confront the evils of the Brotherhood as soon as possible,” he said.",
  "Arab allies of the U.S. are expressing support if the Trump administration declares the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, according to statements from foreign officials and a senior administration official who spoke to Fox News.",
  "Christopher Holton of the Center for Security Policy, a group that has been at the forefront of efforts to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, told Fox News, “It is an absolutely essential step.",
  "David Reaboi, the senior vice-president for strategic operations at the Security Studies Group, added, “Designating the Muslim Brotherhood would be a tremendous step in the right direction.",
  "Fox News previously reported on the internal debates and deliberations in the Trump White House on the move to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO.)",
  "Speaking last week at the United Nations in response to a question from Fox News, the Egyptian Ambassador to the U.N., Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, expressed support for such a move.",
  "“Combined with all the other distractions that have largely paralyzed so many initiatives on Capitol Hill, the effort to block the designation has thus far succeeded,” he said.",
  "Any effort to combat Islamist terrorism needs to take the MB's global network into account.”\n\nBen Evansky reports for Fox News on the United Nations and international affairs.",
  "“The way forward is not to pursue the FTO approach at the State Department, primarily because the initiative is likely to fail,” Schanzer said.",
  "“The commitment inside the West Wing to the question of designating the Brotherhood has not waned,” the official told Fox News.",
  "He blamed some members of the Trump administration, including National Security Adviser H.R.",
  "“The fight is far from over,” a senior administration official told Fox News.",
  "“It’s the main engine driving the terror radicalization process.",
  "From there, additional affiliates can be added,” Schanzer said.",
  "“It would be a positive step forward indeed,” he said.",
  "He can be followed @BenEvansky",
  "McMaster."
