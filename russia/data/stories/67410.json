  "I think the idea of parallel interest is key here, that the Russian intelligence service, once they saw what Trump was doing, quickly latched on in order to push their own agenda, which was very similar to the Russian oligarchy agenda.",
  "“To understand the roots of the collusion, set aside Putin and follow the money.”\n\nThat’s what Seva Gunitsky, a politics professor at the University of Toronto and the author of Aftershocks, told me in a September interview.",
  "The financial connections between Trump and various Russian banks and oligarchs (business elites with ties to the Kremlin) stretch back decades, which is likely a big reason why Trump won’t release his tax returns.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nI think it's justifiable for you to say that it seems impossibly convoluted, but I would say it's still much simpler than this idea that there's a global conspiracy designed to bring down democracy.",
  "But if his financial interests are tied up with Russian oligarchs, who in turn are tied up with the Kremlin and thus have parallel interests, then Trump’s “consistency” becomes much more explainable.",
  "It's also part of Hermitage Capital, an investment fund that was being investigated by Magnitsky (the Russian lawyer who was killed in a Moscow prison in 2009) more than 10 years ago.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nSo we have this infamous Russian lawyer who met with Trump Jr. last year and apparently several other people, including a former Soviet counterintelligence officer.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nSo Prevezon is a holding company with links to Russian elites that has been accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars through New York City real estate.",
  "Putin is happy to sow confusion and distrust in America’s system, of course, but to assume that’s the basis of this operation is to overlook a much simpler motive: money.",
  "So it's very possible that she went into that meeting essentially asking for help, in return for which she would give the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary and the DNC.",
  "Prevezon was part of this giant tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky uncovered in 2008, which led to his death and which led indirectly to the Magnitsky Act of 2012.",
  "And it's hard to even separate the two because, as you probably know, in Russia the distinction between political power and economic power is very fuzzy.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nAgain, this doesn't start with the election; it starts with Russian oligarch money pouring into Trump's real estate and casino businesses.",
  "What we know is that Preet Bharara, the attorney in charge of the case, was fired in early March, and shortly thereafter the Prevezon case was dropped.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nDo we know of any public reactions to the dismissal of the Prevezon case from the Russian lawyer or from anyone else associated with this?",
  "Trump’s election, Gunitsky contends, presented Russian oligarchs with an opportunity to recoup losses and leverage Trump’s debts for political gain.",
  "I asked Gunitsky to lay it out for me as clearly as possible, and to explain the financial dealings between Trump and his Russian business partners.",
  "We can talk about specific cases in a minute, but Donald Trump Jr. has already admitted the importance of Russian money to their business ventures.",
  "It seems clear enough that the financial ties were already there, and when the opportunity presented itself, the Kremlin took full advantage of it.",
  "[Author’s note: Foreign Policy published a detailed report about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s possible role in dismissing the Prevezon case.]",
  "So the interesting thing for me is, was there pressure placed on the U.S. Attorney's Office by the administration, by the Department of Justice?",
  "There’s a tendency here, in part because of our Cold War inertia, to see Putin as this creature with his tentacles in every part of the country.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nWe’ll circle back to the case being dropped in a second, but let’s stick to the role of the Russian lawyer that Trump Jr. met with.",
  "The Magnitsky Act, ostensibly the purpose of the meeting, isn’t going anywhere, so people are concluding that there wasn’t a quid pro quo here.",
  "I think it’s obvious that once Putin saw an opportunity he took it, but these financial ties go back a long way, long before the 2016 election.",
  "I reached out to Gunitsky after he posted a short but incisive thread on Twitter about the financial roots of the Trump-Russia collusion case.",
  "This is a guy without a fixed ideological core, but his bizarre pro-Russia posture is arguably the only issue on which he’s been consistent.",
  "If they have financial leverage over Trump, and they clearly do, then why wouldn’t they want him to become president of the United States?",
  "Putin, we often forget, has supporters to keep happy as well, people who desperately want to open up those channels of Russian finance.",
  "He says the prevailing narrative about Putin interfering in the American election in order to undermine democracy is wildly overstated.",
  "It’s not that obstructing democracy wasn’t important; it’s that it was potentially a happy byproduct of these financial relationships.",
  "And if we emphasize this financial angle a bit more, it also makes a lot of sense that he would not want to release his tax returns.",
  "It’s not like the Russians foresaw back in 1987, when they first started dealing with Trump, that he might become president in 2017.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nI’d only slightly disagree here and say the thing about which he’s been most consistent is the desire to make money.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nAs hard as it is to make sense of all this, it does help to explain Trump’s unusual consistency on all things Russia.",
  "Gunitsky, who was raised in Russia, has followed the evolving relationship between Donald Trump and Russia for more than a decade.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nWe know there are deep links between Russian money and Trump, but let’s talk about how the interests intertwine.",
  "He's been in power for 17 years, the people who support him are starting to itch a little bit, and he has to keep them happy.",
  "It's sometimes portrayed this way in the West, but in reality the Russian government is messy and disorganized and ad hoc.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nTo be clear about what you’re saying, you’re not denying the political motivations of Putin or the Kremlin.",
  "They had been ready to prosecute, witnesses were flown in, it was all set to go, and it was settled rather unexpectedly.",
  "It's possible that Putin was not even fully aware of efforts to court Trump up until last year, or a couple years ago.",
  "What did you make of the recent revelations about Trump Jr.’s meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya?",
  "I’m only saying that the financial motivations in all of this have been understated in relation to its importance.",
  "Putin is often put up as this sort of central antagonist, but the Russian government is not this shadowy monolith.",
  "But if we're talking about the roots of the collusion, we have to look at where Trump's links with Russia begin.",
  "He said publicly in 2008 that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.",
  "It’s impossible to know for sure what happened in that room, but these are extremely plausible interpretations.",
  "Many of them Trump has been working with for years, well before he developed any serious political ambitions.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nNow, Prevezon’s lawyer was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who of course met with Trump Jr. last year.",
  "Obviously, it's kind of his wheelhouse, New York City real estate, so I am sure he at least heard about it.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nAnd this is why you think Western media has overplayed the centrality of Putin in all of this?",
  "[These roots] don't start with the election; they start with money, and namely Russian oligarch money.",
  "We have this notion of Putin as a kind of master strategist playing 10-dimensional chess with Trump.",
  "They're not happy about sanctions; they're not happy about restrictions on their financial dealings.",
  "And we’re not talking about small change here; we’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.",
  "They're only asking for some relief in this case, in return for certain compromising documents.",
  "She said it was the beginning of the end of the Cold War, and she said there'd be more to come.",
  "We know they paid something like $6 million, which is a fraction of what the lawsuit was about.",
  "In your mind, this is about understanding what catalyzed the alleged collusion process, right?",
  "In any case, we can see the possible motivations of the people approaching Trump for favors.",
  "It's just that now he's undergoing a level of scrutiny that he’s never experienced before.",
  "I think the tough question critics have been asking is where is the quid pro quo in that?",
  "The U.S. Attorney’s Office was also preparing a massive case against Prevezon last year.",
  "But there’s an unbelievable amount of smoke, and a massive web of overlapping interests.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nSeveral months after Trump takes office, the Prevezon case is dismissed.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nDo we have any evidence that Trump was involved in any way with Prevezon?",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nVeselnitskaya was ecstatic about the Prevezon case on her social media.",
  "Again, like so much of the evidence here, this doesn’t prove anything definitively.",
  "She had been pushing for a long time to get something done about the Prevezon case.",
  "So I think this is a case that hasn't really entered the public consciousness yet.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nLooking at the timeline here helps to clarify your broader argument.",
  "Congressional Democrats have openly expressed concerns about what happened here.",
  "And if we take that, then his consistency on Russia becomes much more sensible.",
  "I think you're absolutely right that he has no strong ideological commitments.",
  "When I say the collusion starts with financial interests, this is what I mean.",
  "Because that would expose just how deeply embedded he is with Russian money.",
  "But I'm sure that [special counsel Robert] Mueller's team is looking at it.",
  "The U.S. attorney was carefully preparing a case against Prevezon Holdings.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nWe don't know that Trump was involved in any way with that.",
  "They were all set to go forward, and then suddenly the case was settled.",
  "But it's not even necessary for him to have any direct connections here.",
  "I'm not saying the political dimension is unimportant — surely it is.",
  "We've seen that painfully over and over during the last few months.",
  "She said it was \"settled on Russian terms\"; that's a direct quote.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nThis collusion story gets more convoluted by the day.",
  "Possibly even enough to keep Trump out of another bankruptcy.",
  "But we should be talking a lot more about the Prevezon case.",
  "These motivations are all entangled — I want to stress that.",
  "I don’t want to insist that this was all about the money.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nAnd we still have no explanation about this?",
  "And I think that may be overstating the case just a bit.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nExplain what that is and why it matters.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nSo what happened with the Prevezon case?",
  "And I think for Trump it was always about the money.",
  "It’s hard to say what the groups’ motivations were.",
  "But we don't know if he has any direct connections.",
  "But you seem to think it’s pretty straightforward.",
  "They want to know why it was settled so quickly.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nWe know because they’ve told us.",
  "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"",
  "Prevezon's own lawyers were kind of shocked.",
  "Sean Illing\n\nAnd we know this how, exactly?",
  "Sean Illing\n\nSo walk me through the trail.",
  "It doesn’t get much clearer than that.",
  "So they were extremely happy about it.",
  "Was pressure being applied from above?",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nNot as a far as I know.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nI think that’s right.",
  "Until it was abruptly dropped.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nThat’s right.",
  "Seva Gunitsky\n\nAbsolutely.",
  "Where does the money lead?",
  "And it begins with money.",
  "Here’s what he told me.",
  "So what happened?"
