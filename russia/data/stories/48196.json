  "WASHINGTON — After two days and more than 10 hours of questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, there was widespread consensus among lawmakers that social media technology — and its potential for abuse — had far outpaced Washington and that Congress should step in to close the gap.",
  "For lawmakers, the calculus is tricky: They do not want to infringe on First Amendment rights or hurt Silicon Valley innovation but are also unsure how to regulate this new breed of company, which wields enormous power by collecting vast amounts of private data from billions of consumers.",
  "“I think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.”\n\nMr. Zuckerberg, composed but noncommittal about making any sweeping privacy changes, conceded that it was “inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.”",
  "“While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured,” said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.",
  "But the agreement largely ended there."
