  "On Monday, April 23, Joy Reid told us without equivocation: “In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog.”\n\nOn Tuesday, April 24, NBC News told us that Reid’s cyber security expert has “significant evidence indicating that not only was Ms. Reid’s old blog compromised, some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time, suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with intent to tarnish Ms. Reid’s character.”\n\nOn Saturday, April 28, Reid admitted that none of the above is true.",
  "White House Correspondent’s Dinner of Hate\n\nBecause comedienne Michelle’s Wolf’s seething hatred of Trump and conservatives had already been well-established through her work on the far-left Daily Show (and her Twitter account), the White House Correspondents’ Association intentionally hired her knowing she would use kids gloves against them and instead attempt to humiliate the president and his staff — including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was sitting just a few feet away.",
  "We Learned CNN Colluded with the Deep State to Fabricate Russia Collusion Hoax\n\nAlthough the media had access to the salacious Fusion GPS document accusing President Trump of colluding with the Russians for months, and although they could not confirm any of it despite having billions of powerful corporate dollars at their disposal, we now know that CNN did not care if the dossier was fake.",
  "Just listen to these terrible people howl with laughter, join in on the mockery with callbacks, and applaud wildly at the end:\n\nTom Brokaw’s Alleged Victims Attacked as Liars\n\nProbably because she worked at Fox News, Linda Vester, who is accusing Brokaw of groping, harassing, and kissing her without consent, is being dismissed, cast aside, and all but attacked as a liar.",
  "In just one week, the national media stood by homophobic liar Joy Reid, dismissed credible allegations of sexual misconduct against Tom Brokaw, handed Jake Tapper an award for fake news, used comedienne Michelle Wolf as a hate-avatar, destroyed an admiral with lies, and were caught red-handed colluding with the Deep State to overturn the election of President Trump.",
  "White House Correspondents Dinner Gives Jake Tapper Award for Fake News\n\nBreitbart’s Ian Mason reported on Saturday Jake Tapper won a big award at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner for what now looks like fake news:\n\nThe article, by CNN host Jake Tapper and co-workers Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, and Carl Bernstein, is now up for the WHCA’s Merriman Smith Award.",
  "A Phony Dosier Used to Destroy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson\n\nWielding the exact same playbook used to further the Russian collusion hoax, but this time with the goal of personally and professionally destroying Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, the media ran with uncorroborated allegations about Jackson fed to them by a Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), as fact.",
  "It makes a series of specific claims, among them: “The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.” This claim in particular was called into question Thursday when Comey explicitly denied he presented any such two-page summary and said that the briefing was spoken only.",
  "Jackson, who was the White House physician and who is hated by the establishment media for giving Trump a clean bill of mental and physical health, was relentlessly smeared in the media using anonymously sourced and completely unsubstantiated allegations, all in an effort to derail his nomination to head the Veterans Administration.",
  "And then, according to a congressional report of his own testimony, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper leaked the news to CNN’s leading anti-Trump activist, Jake Tapper, who also knew the dossier was fake news, but still stopped the planet from turning with breaking news to tell the world about its existence.",
  "Besides being a jaw-dropping look at how corrupted and dishonest the media are, the list below is what happens when a culture is so besotted with its own virtue, so provincial and out of touch, so venal and hate-driven, that it cannot even begin to grasp how its behavior looks to the outside world.",
  "Lying, Homophobe Joy Reid Gets Away with Being a Lying Homophobe\n\nIn just the last few days, and in order to escape responsibility for a series of homophobic posts published on her blog some ten years ago, the story told to us by Joy Reid and NBC News has changed dramatically.",
  "“CNN reported a time that you handed two-page executive summary of the dossier over to him,” Baier asked Comey, to which he said, “I did not.” Comey did not entirely rule out the existence of a two-page summary, but it was clear he did not present one to the president-elect.",
  "This was not about informing the public, it was about misinforming the public, about humiliating a president CNN despises, about using lies to lay the groundwork for the appointment of a special counsel and the doup d’état of impeachment.",
  "What has been falsely advertised for years as an event where those who cover the White House get together with the president and his staff to enjoy a good-natured evening of self-deprecating humor, revealed its true self over the weekend.",
  "So, while withholding crucial information (like the fact it was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign), disgraced former FBI director James Comey figured out a way to deliver the “hook” by briefing the president on the dossier.",
  "In order to wrist-flick Vester’s accusations, more than 60 women, including Rachel Maddow, rape-denier Andrea Mitchell, Maria Shriver, and Kelly O’Donnell, signed a letter to circle the wagons around Brokaw.",
  "Working in tandem with CNN, and just minutes after Tapper made what he knew was fake news the biggest story in the world, the far-left BuzzFeed released the full contents of the phony dossier to the public.",
  "Or did Clapper withhold that information, thereby using Tapper and CNN as his puppet to pass along oppo research as legitimate intel; and if that is the case, why isn’t Tapper furious about being used?",
  "We Learned CNN Helped James Clapper Lie to Cover Up His Leak to CNN\n\nAfter CNN broke the news of the phony dossier, Clapper, who was still director of national intelligence, denied leaking it.",
  "Tester gave the media the equivalent of a phony dossier on Jackson, the media ran with it, and only after the hit job was successful did we learn that it was almost certainly all lies.",
  "Clapper told Tapper what to say, Tapper said it, and he got it wrong; and Tapper probably doesn’t care because this is not about getting it correct, this is about getting Trump.",
  "Instead of looking for the truth, the far-left cable channel was only looking for a “hook” as a means to make public what they knew was a phony document filled with lies.",
  "This was a con game, a set-up of a duly elected president to manufacture an excuse to dress up a steaming pile of fake news (the dossier) as a legitimate story.",
  "And speaking of fake news…\n\nDid Clapper tell Tapper that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for the dossier, or did Clapper withhold that pertinent information?",
  "The monsters who cover the White House hate us, hate anyone who is not like them, hate women who dare not think like them, and Wolf was their avatar.",
  "Although CNN knew Clapper leaked it (because he leaked it to CNN), CNN’s Tapper still reported Clapper’s lying denials as though they were credible.",
  "Brian Williams still has an anchor job and Dan Rather is still trotted out as journalism’s elder statesman, so that question was answered long ago.",
  "The only standard the media hold anyone to is ideological purity, and Reid is pure, so she can lie to us, to her employer, and even to the FBI.",
  "This is something no other alleged abuser has ever enjoyed, and it is not about facts or decency, it is only about left-wing tribalism.",
  "To lend credibility to Reid’s wild goose chase, we were also told by Reid and by NBC News that the FBI is investigating the case.",
  "In other words, did Tapper hide a crucial bit of information from us as he passed along oppo research as legitimate intel?",
  "Do not be fooled into believing those in the establishment media feigning outrage and disappointment over Wolf’s hate.",
  "Does anyone care if the precious assets of the FBI were wasted on a wild goose chase to save a lying homophobe’s job?",
  "“I hired cybersecurity experts to see if somebody had manipulated my words or my former blog.",
  "They all knew who Wolf was and only said something when it began to backfire.",
  "Moreover, there was no “significant evidence.” In fact, there is NO EVIDENCE.",
  "Rather, he is a Deep State stooge who takes dictation from the Deep State.",
  "And the reality is, they have not been able to prove it,” she confessed.",
  "Naturally, CNN once again took the lead in spreading this fake news.",
  "Does anyone care that an anchor for NBC News has been caught lying?",
  "There was no journalism here, no reporting, no shoe leather.",
  "How could Tapper get something like this so horribly wrong?",
  "Imagine what these monsters are doing behind the scenes.",
  "—\n\nThese seven items are just what we know about.",
  "Why is CNN hiring a guy who used them like that?",
  "Some #MeToo victims are more equal than others.",
  "She did not “learn” that she had been hacked.",
  "CNN later hired this liar as a contributor.",
  "What’s a little fake news between friends?",
  "The second one has not yet come forward.",
  "There was no news motive at work here.",
  "Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.",
  "Vester is not Brokaw’s only accuser.",
  "And this is exactly what happened.",
  "Easy: Tapper is not a journalist.",
  "Does anyone care if it is true?",
  "Follow his Facebook Page here.",
  "Is that even true?",
  "Obviously not."
