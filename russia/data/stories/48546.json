  "Lasry, co-founder of Avenue Capital Group, made his comments after reports on Friday said political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was able to collect data on 50 million Facebook profiles without their consent.",

  "The shares traded more than 10 percent below their all-time high set Feb. 1 and dropped below their 50- and 100-day moving averages, two key technical levels.",
  "\"So therefore, if you have the government coming in and now it's a utility, as a utility there's going to be a limit on what you're going to be able to make.\"",
  "The news sent Facebook's stock sliding more than 7 percent, putting it on track for its biggest one-day decline since September 2012.",
  "The government should step in and regulate Facebook like a utility, according to hedge fund manager Marc Lasry.",
  "Cambridge Analytica worked on Facebook ads with President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.",

  "Cambridge Analytica has denied violating Facebook's terms of service.",
  "Facebook's decline also pushed the broader stock market lower."
