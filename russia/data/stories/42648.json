  "(The policy difference between Apple's iOS and Google's Android is that apps on Android have historically been required only to obey Google's technical requirements, whereas Apple has human staff members who review them for acceptable content too.)",
  "MSNBC\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday said he was comfortable with people using an iPhone to look at pornography — an opinion that represents a change of tone from the Apple cofounder Steve Jobs' well-known dislike of adult-entertainment content.",
  "But then he added: \"It doesn't mean that you can't use an iPhone to go to your browser and go to some porno site, if you want to do that, but —\"\n\nRecode's Kara Swisher, who was hosting the interview, joked, \"Nobody does that.\"",
  "The founder repeatedly talked about his dislike of porn, saying the iPhone's controlled environment offered \"freedom from porn\" and \"folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.\"",
  "We make sure all the movies are coded in such a way where you can say, \"I only want my child looking at G movies,\" or whatever, or we have a parental control around apps.",
  "In an interview on MSNBC, Cook talked about how the company reviewed and approved every app offered in the iPhone App Store and rejected those containing porn.",
  "It doesn't mean that you can't use an iPhone to go to your browser and go to some porno site, if you want to do that, but —\n\nSwisher: Nobody does that.",
  "We've worked for the music industry to code things explicit, and so a parent could say, \"I don't want my child listening to explicit content.\"",
  "And we don't subscribe to the view that you have to let everybody in that wants to or if you don't, you don't believe in free speech.",
  "After the studio audience's laughter subsided, he added: \"I'm just saying that it's not what we want to put in our store.",
  "Nonetheless, it also dovetails with Apple's longtime prohibition on controversial or offensive content in the App Store.",
  "What you sell in that store says something about you, and if you don't want to sell that other thing, you don't sell it.",
  "What is it doing, is it doing what it's saying it's doing, is it meeting the privacy policy that they're stating, right?",
  "We want kids to go to the store, right, because kids — there's a lot of learning, education apps in the store.",
  "\"What you sell in that store says something about you,\" he said, and Apple chooses not to offer that material.",
  "We don't believe that - we don't believe that because we're like the guy on the corner store.",
  "Swisher: No, I —\n\nCook: But I'm just saying that it's not what we want to put in our store.",
  "Read the whole exchange below:\n\nTim Cook: We're looking at every app in detail.",
  "And so, this is something we've always felt really responsible for.",
  "You can say, \"I don't want them on these certain apps.\"",
  "We're always looking at improving and raising the bar.",
  "But we do carefully review each app and police now.",
  "Kara Swisher: It's a very valid —\n\nCook: Right?",
  "That is a marked transition from the Jobs line.",
  "And Cook replied: \"I'm not making fun of it.\"",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\nCook: I'm not making fun of it.",
  "Cook's line felt a little more permissive.",
  "We want kids to go to the store, right?\"",
  "Tim Cook talking on MSNBC on Wednesday.",
  "And so, we're always looking at that.",
  "Should we raise the bar even more?",
  "And so, we've always done that.",
