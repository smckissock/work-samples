  "Warburg Pincus, which has $44 billion in private equity assets under management, is looking to invest more in machine learning technology, especially as it can be applied to companies, Warburg Pincus’ managing director, Cary Davis, said in an interview.",
  "Some of the technology companies that Warburg has invested in, such as cyber security firm CrowdStrike, use machine learning in some of their offerings but the firm has not made an investment in a company that focuses solely on the technology.",
  "April 18 (Reuters) - Paul Maritz, a technology executive who held senior roles at EMC Corp, Microsoft Corp and VMWare Inc, has joined Warburg Pincus LLC as an industry adviser, the private equity firm announced on Tuesday.",
  "Maritz will join a handful of other industry technology advisers at Warburg Pincus, including Scot Melland, a former CEO of human resources software company DHI Group Inc who joined the firm in 2015.",
  "Maritz is executive chairman of EMC’s Pivotal unit and is on the board of directors of VMware Inc, where he had served as a CEO from 2008 to 2012.",
  "Maritz was an adviser to Warburg Pincus 15 years ago and founded Pi Corporation, a software firm backed by Warburg that was sold to EMC in 2008.",
  "Machine learning is an emerging technology that can help predict behavior based on past patterns by crunching large amounts of data.",
  "“Business to business (B2B) machine learning in the next 10 years will be as big as enterprise software is now,” Davis said.",
  "Maritz, 62, will advise Warburg Pincus on software investments with a focus on cloud computing and machine learning.",
  "Computer maker Dell Inc bought EMC for about $67 billion last year and now owns 80 percent of VMware.",
