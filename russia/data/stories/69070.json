  "POWERS: The other thing that the -- as to whether she's telling the truth, look, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Michael Cohen had told friends that the reason that he was late on the payments is because he couldn't get in touch with Donald Trump, which completely blows up this story that Michael Cohen was using his own money and that Trump didn't know about it.",
  "So it brings a focus on to this very kind of black hole in the investigation and in the narrative of what happened that sometime between when Michael Flynn was on the phone talking to the Russian ambassador and when Trump actually entered the White House, there was this meeting in the Seychelles, and that's a big part of what Nader is being questioned about by Mueller's team.",
  "Well, Michael Cohen here, we had a story about this today, has also been a subject or at least a person of interest in the Mueller probe, You have, several different incidents where Bob Mueller, special counsel is asking questions about how he interacted in Trump's orbit, Russian projects that he was involved in and different things he was doing.",
  "DANIEL PFEIFFER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: I mean, just sitting here for 2the last like 15 minutes listening to your show, Don, like the chaos is so palpable, whether it's the Stormy Daniels suit or Gary Cohn leaving in a tiff over tariffs or reading on CNN.com that Trump has authorized Anthony Scaramucci to attack his own chief of staff.",
  "It says in there, to be clear, the attempts to intimidate Miss Clifford into silencing her and shutting her up in order to protect Mr. Trump continued unabated, for example, only days ago on February 27th, 2018, Mr. Trump's attorney, Mr. Cohen, surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceedings against Miss Clifford in Los Angeles.",
  "He was for them and even back in the 1980's as a developer in New York he was for them, and as you saw this administration go on for months and months and months, there were weekly meetings where, you know, Gary Cohn, Rob Porter, now a departed staff secretary, a number of other senior adviser pushed against them.",
  "So what you're seeing here is Mueller's probe is not looking backward as what happened in terms of whether there was collusion to influence the election that already passed or whether there was an ongoing effort by other nations besides Russia to try to manipulate or exert influence over key (AUDIO GAP) forward.",
  "Number one, remember that George Papadopoulos was also stopped, I believe, at the same airport, Dulles airport, which is outside the DMV area here, and he was immediately able to have his phone imaged and a grand jury subpoena issued to him at that day to be able to testify in a later date.",
  "This is an administration that, you know, doesn't have as deep a bench of experience on economic issues, on policy, so the fact that he was somebody that's respected by folks in the business community, as well as having built really strong relationships with many folks up on Capitol Hill.",
  "You know what interested me enough, Don, one of the people who was on the Federal Elections Commission at the time that the John Edwards previous with him I can't think of a name, was having an affair with and talking about flying her privately because of being pregnant, et cetera.",
  "I mean, his job was to advise the president on economic issues, but he spends most of his time, as far as I can tell, talking to Washington reporters, telling people about how sad he is about working in the White House or how hard he is trying so hard to save the country.",
  "You have not only a president who is incapable to have governing, has learned nothing about governing in his first year, he doesn't even seem to know what he's for and what he's against, as we've seen, when he talks about the school shootings or gun control or tariffs.",
  "I certainly think whatever the circumstances are here, you're going to see a lot more of Michael Cohen, who was the president's personal attorney in New York and has known him forever and was kind of seen in Trump's orbit as his fixer and as his body man, so to speak.",
  "You would think that given everything we know, both about these efforts and the fact that we have had the security clearance debacle, that he would not be doing what he was doing, which is basically playing de facto secretary of state on a number of critical issues.",
  "If you go all the way back to the very beginning of Donald Trump, he has opposed trade agreements, he has been critical of trade agreements, he has claimed that that is, you know, the cause of so many economic problems, even when it often isn't, you know.",
  "Gary Cohn, Sally Yates, Michael Flynn, James Comey, Michael Dubke, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Anthony Scaramucci, Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Tom Price, Omarosa Manigault Newmann, Rob Porter, Hope Hicks, Katie Walsh, Gina Powell, Michael Short, K.T.",
  "But the real question that I have, Stephen, is you have no issue with whether or not the president or his attorney broke campaign finance law by paying off some...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMOORE: No, no, look, I think we should get to the bottom of that.",
  "So, you know, while I don't think it's a choice I would make for a career, you know, she is still a person who deserves respect and you don't have any problem with Donald Trump who used to hang out at the Playboy mansion and those kind of things.",
  "Remember, there was reporting last week that Jared Kushner was somebody who a lot of foreign nations, at least four including the UAE were interested because they believed they could exercise undue influence and try to manipulate him in some way.",
  "LEMON: The Washington Post reported last week that officials in at least four countries, including Mexico, had privately discussed ways to manipulate Jared Kushner by exploiting his financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience.",
  "And, you know, not really known as a rock-ribbed republican, but respected by a lot of the republican allies that the president has up on Capitol Hill and was critical to helping pass the signature accomplishment so far, which was tax reform.",
  "It alleges that after discovering that Miss Clifford, who by the way is Stormy Daniels' real name, Stephanie Clifford, she said that Mr. Trump with the assistance of his attorney, aggressively sought to shut her up to avoid telling the story.",
  "I mean, I remember when I first meeting with Donald Trump when I first met him in Trump tower and he asked me and Larry Kudlow to be senior economic advisers for his campaign and we said, Donald, we don't agree with you on trade and tariffs.",
  "KEVIN MADDEN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: Well, I think a lot of -- I think I can pretty much predict what the White House is going to say, which is that this is somebody trying to get attention, trying to drive their own sort of P.R.",
  "You know, who knows what Donald Trump did, you know, 10 years ago, but, look, wasn't this litigated during the campaign when all these women came forward and, you know, people knew about this when they voted for Donald Trump.",

  "And I think it's interesting because Anthony Scaramucci obviously he's a news watcher has not denied the stories and I don't think he would freelance anything like that, right, especially about the president's chief of staff.",
  "The prospect of having discussions, negotiations, talks, the North Koreans usually do a very good job in extending those forever, getting concessions from the United States or from South Korea, on the economic side of things.",
  "And she said she was forced to do it because she was coerced and she was pressured by the attorney through from Trump, but she talked specifically to Mr. Cohen, saying that she was intimidated and coerced into signing this.",
  "In the suit, it alleges that there are so many details, but this is all happening, like I said, around the time when we heard all about Donald Trump saying grab them in the p and that he can kiss women wherever he wants.",
  "Has any president had a better first year on the economy than Donald Trump has with the surging stock market and the, you know, massive increases in jobs and we're seeing all this investment flow in the United States.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: So it's interesting because for weeks now the top intel chiefs have been saying that they haven't been given direct order to stop Russia, the Russian interference in the midterm elections.",
  "You know, this also brings focus on this meeting that happens in the Seychelles in January 2017, right before the inauguration, which has really puzzled both investigators and journalists for almost over a year now.",
  "And so when you hear about the parallels being drawn here and about the potential for someone advising the president or a member of his team in an incorrect way, of course, Mueller's probe is going to include that.",
  "I want to bring in CNN political analyst, Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post, political analyst Kirsten Powers of the USA Today, senior economic analyst Stephen Moore, and political commentator, Kevin Madden.",
  "She also says in the lawsuit that she signed a nondisclosure disagreement, but that it is invalid and that's what she's suing over, because she says that Donald Trump never signed it, though he did know it.",

  "He said it was unrelated to the Trump campaign or the Trump organization.",
  "There is no indication that Cohen is a target of Mueller's investigation.",
  "Does it mean that there is great energy in the White House do you think?",

  "If anybody's advice I should be taking, it's yours.",
  "This was mentioned in this lawsuit currently today.",
  "Number one, Bill Clinton is not president anymore.",
  "But you know, there are some very credible claims.",
  "LEMON: This is like an '80s nighttime soap opera.",
  "And this is something that happened 10 years ago.",

  "I don't necessarily agree with these tariffs.",
  "And you don't have any doubt about it either.",
  "I think that's what a president should have.",
  "And he said, look, we can agree to disagree.",
  "He stayed on, but he's leaving over tariffs?",
  "What's your reaction to this breaking story?",
  "I mean, these are really strong allegations.",
  "[22:04:57] And here is an interesting point.",
  "In fact, he likes conflict between staffers.",
  "SIDNER: All right, so the timeline is this.",
  "My only point, I mean, really, a porn star?",

  "And we are having strong backup systems.",
  "BLINKEN: Well, you ask a great question.",
  "I need to\n\n\n\nswitch gears to do it here.",
  "I mean, Donald Trump did run on tariffs.",
  "Breaking news out of Washington tonight.",
  "Time now for Don Lemon and CNN Tonight.",
  "BLINKEN: Look, we've been there before.",
  "How can the U.S. actually be prepared?",
  "Thank you for joining me this evening.",

  "I want to mention something, Don.",
  "Which is where we've been before.",

  "What's the impact on the country?",
  "Thank you so much for joining me.",
  "Dan, I'm going to start with you.",

  "We will counteract is strongly.",
  "So let's seize the opportunity.",
  "SIDNER: Bold and the beautiful.",
  "She's saying he didn't sign it.",
  "LEMON: Michael, let her finish.",
  "Will there be any consequences?",
  "So, wait, let me explain this.",
  "Donald Trump is the president.",
  "MOORE: OK. Just a quick thing.",
  "And I have no doubt about it.",
  "It makes no difference to me.",

  "SIDNER: It does explain that.",
  "And as always, there's more.",
  "So, Sara, where do we start?",
  "He was a recess appointment.",
  "LEMON: Thank you, gentlemen.",
  "Good evening to both of you.",
  "Josh, give me your reaction?",
  "The guy have no idea what...",
  "Wouldn't he take his advice?",
  "Trump was fuming after A.G.",

  "But he believes that it is.",
  "Thank you, I appreciate it.",
  "DAWSEY: Well, I don't know.",
  "What do you know about him?",
  "I don't have a good answer.",
