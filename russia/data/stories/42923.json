  "In a statement Friday, Facebook acknowledged that it learned it had been \"lied to\" about Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate's activities in 2015, more than two years before suspending the firm from its platform, but did not alert users at the time.",

  "Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Concordia Summit\n\nA spokesman for Cambridge Analytica also said the firm refutes the stories from the Guardian, which is associated with the Observer, and the New York Times, and rejects Wylie.",
  "Christopher Wylie, who worked to help obtain the data, told Britain's The Guardian that Cambridge's entire operation was designed to \"exploit\" what they knew about people from their profiles and \"target their inner demons.\"",

  "\"We were forced to take action against Mr Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company's intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard.",
  "\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.",
  "In statement released early Sunday, Wylie said he feels a \"sense of regret every day when I see where [Cambridge Analytics] have helped take our world.\"",

  "\"We use nearly five thousand different data points about you to craft and target a message,\" Nix told TechRepublic senior reporter Dan Patterson.",
  "Wylie's attorney Tamsin Allen, said upon learning data harvesting was about to made public, Facebook \"privately welcomed\" Wylie's offer to help.",
  "Cambridge Analytica also said that \"no data from GSR\" was used by Cambridge as a part of services it provided to Mr. Trump's campaign.",
  "\"If privacy and democracy are to mean anything in a digital age, Facebook has to face up to its shared responsibilities,\" Wylie said.",
  "No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.",

  "It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.\"",

  "He told the Guardian \"we exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles.",
  "And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.",
  "The newspaper reported Mueller asked the firm to hand over internal records.",
  "\"The data points are not just a representative model of you.",
