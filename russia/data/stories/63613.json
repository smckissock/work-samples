  "Or a Stephen Miller or some of the other folk who's are supposed to serve, right, the American people, but they are serving not only their own self-interests but also the interests of this president, which very much conflict overall with what are in our best interests, our national security interests as well as ensuring we continue to be this -- you know, I shouldn't say continue to be -- hope to become, you know, this beacon of light and hope for all of the world.",
  "And then we got on Friday, a 25-page letter that you're referring to from OPR, which had all the different considerations, all the way that they thought Pete screwed up and then all the mitigating factors that they considered and concluded -- not recommended, but concluded that the right punishment here for Pete would be the suspension and demotion.",
  "PANETTA: My biggest concern right now is that as we get into the issues that directly affect the president, the issue of obstruction, the issue of whether or not there was a conspiracy here to work with the Russians, that Bob Mueller is able to really look at all of the dots here and determine whether or not you can connect all of those lines.",
  "LEON PANETTA, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: Well, it tells me that it's a pretty loose operation if somebody can walk into the Situation Room and be able to do a recording because as soon as you walk into the Situation Room, you're supposed to get rid of all of your technology, your iPhones, et cetera, and that should be enforced.",
  "So, what's fascinating to me is that corporate America where Donald Trump plans to -- is allegedly this big rich billionaire boss that's figured it out, he's cracked the code, he still hasn't figured out that they've all said that diversity and inclusion is the path forward to ensuring your bottom line is great.",
  "PANETTA: I -- I don't think there's any question here that based on what the president said, based on what Rudy Giuliani has said about that conversation, that there was -- it was clear that there was a signal being sent to Director Comey that he ought to go easy with regards to any prosecution here.",
  "GOELMAN: At the end of the day, I was really surprised that they fired Pete, mostly because we had an agreement with the FBI OPR, Office of Professional Responsibility, which is their main caretaker for internal discipline, that Pete would get a 60-day suspension and a demotion.",
  "I would try to find the best people I could find, and because no race and no gender has a monopoly on good ideas, if you're truly seeking out the best people to execute, you're going to wind up with some white folks, some black folks, some Asian, some men, some women.",
  "CONWAY: I would say that -- well, first of all you're totally not covering the fact that our secretary of housing and urban development and world renowned -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm asking you about the White House staff, the\n\n\n\npeople the president's with every day.",
  "DAVIS: I mean, I think there's the general concern for some things that he seemed to predict, his tweets, the Podesta tweet, you know, has been the subject of much controversy all over the media and also puts him in a position to wonder how he was able to predict.",
  "So, I don't think he necessarily would have wanted to work on, you know, the next high-profile political investigation, but in terms of, you know, going after spies from our adversaries who are undermining American national security, that's what motivated him.",
  "But I'll tell you what's interesting about this situation, my friend, is the pushback that I heard from Scott Jennings tonight if you were watching in our \"Great Debate\" is hey, you know, it's not supposed to be about some kind of quota system on intelligence.",
  "I think it's important that we give Bob Mueller the opportunity to be able to complete this investigation, and that means not rush him to judgment, but have him proceed based on his timetable and what he needs either to make a case or not make a case.",
  "CUOMO: Now, I remember back before neither of us knew better, at least certainly I didn't, when I was talking to Roger about Guccifer and him talking to them, he was -- didn't believe anything about Guccifer was real or anything like that.",
  "Ultimately, I think all of these actions she has taken have culminated in her own pursuit of her own fortune and glory and have not been in the pursuit of serving the American people or the agenda that she was hired to promote.",
  "But, Scott, how about the idea of Omarosa, what she captured from John Kelly, the suggestions of what she says was a threat, what seemed to be her version of what the president knew versus how he came across in the phone call.",
  "They only know what you're saying, and you're leading them down a path, maybe trying to tie in this notorious figure that Roger Stone is from \"get me Roger Stone\" and \"win at all costs,\" when that's just the public persona.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGOELMAN: Well, I don't think the president of the United States should be going around and telling executive agencies -- executive branch agencies who they should be firing and who they should be retaining.",
  "We've seen that occur in the past, and I think that is an issue obviously that Bob Mueller is focused on, because there is a question here whether this president did take steps to try to obstruct the pursuit of justice.",
  "It doesn't surprise me, but, yes, it absolutely matters because you want -- you want insight from people who have been there, who have lived it regardless of what the background, religion, you know, ethnicity, gender.",
  "CUOMO: The two different versions of what we're hearing from Giuliani about what happened with the president and Comey vis-a-vis Flynn -- how material a difference -- well, we know it's a material difference.",
  "But to make it moral equivalence, when you're coming at me because I'm saying that you don't matter in this world as much as I do, those are not equivalent motivations that lead us into the confrontation.",
  "But drawing a moral equivalency between those espousing hate and those fighting it because they both resort to violence emboldens hate, legitimizes hateful belief and elevates what should be stamped out.",
  "\n\n\n\nReturn to Transcripts main page\n\nCUOMO PRIME TIME\n\nKristin Davis Testified Before Mueller Grand Jury; FBI Fires Peter Strzok over Anti-Trump Texts; Omarosa Releases Secret White House Recording.",
  "However, how about the idea that the president says he was told she stunk every qualified way that you can think about it, and then he said, but keep her because she says good things about me.",
  "PANETTA: This kind of investigation, if it's going to be thorough and it's going to be accurate and it's going to really uncover the truth is by its very nature one that's going to take time.",
  "CUOMO: Couldn't that criticism be equally leveled at the president, Angela, that he finds out that she stinks in every way that someone can stink in a job, and he says, but try to keep her.",
  "JENNINGS: Well, I think the priority for any White House should be to hire the best possible people to do the job, to serve the country, and to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Hold on a second.",
  "GOELMAN: No, I was just going to say that before Pete testified in front of those two congressional committees, the voicemail and e-mails that we were getting were overwhelmingly hate mail.",
  "I don't know that we ought to hold people to quotas based on the census, but we ought to hold people to the standard do I have the best people and they're executing on behalf of my agenda.",
  "CUOMO: The idea of bringing shame on the FBI, I thought Strzok was fairly open and honest about that in his testimony, that he is aware that things he did hurt the reputation of the FBI.",
  "Then when they found out I talked to the press, accidentally, they moved that up a week, giving me four days notice with a 2-year-old and saying we don't care what happens to your child.",
  "DAVIS: I think they're concerned with all of the people in the 2016\n\n\n\ncampaign, all of the high-profile names that we've seen come across and all the people that have worked for Roger.",
  "They have access to the president and lots of information and I don't think it looks good for us on the national or international stage to have people acting the way she's acting.",
  "But we still have to look at the facts of her bizarre firing and any kind of security concerns and concerns about the operational integrity of what's going on in that White House.",
  "I mean, look, first of all there's a difference between political appointees like, you know, the attorney general or even Jim Comey, who the president generally can fire at will.",
  "Chris, please tell me you have a graphic on the diversity in the White House if Scott -- I'll give you five good dollars if you can name five black people in the White House.",
  "And so far, at least it's my impression by the number of indictments he has, by the trials he's in, and by the way he has approached this job, that he is doing a careful job.",
  "But nevertheless, she's not acting any differently than the rest of the people who have either been summarily dismissed or some of the folks who still sit in the White House.",
  "CONWAY: We have Ja'Ron, who's done a fabulous job and very involved with -- he's been very involved with Jared Kushner and President Trump on prison reform in the beginning.",
  "And something -- a statement like, say, win at all costs, doesn't mean that he would go out and commit some huge, colossal crime to impair the democracy of our country.",
  "There is a normal process that is followed for disciplining civil servants, federal employees, and that process was followed here but in form only, not in substance.",
  "But in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument: if you're a punk that comes to start trouble in a mask and hurt people, you're not about any virtuous cause.",
  "But since then, the intelligence community has shown that they believe that Guccifer is exactly what we were afraid it was, which is a front for Russian hackers.",
  "And I said the same thing in the grand jury --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You won't give me any specifics but that word are more than -- thank you for injecting to the audience.",
  "Two more big questions for him: does he think Trump's attorney is changing his story about what the president told Jim Comey with regards to General Flynn?",
  "What I think is really interesting and you -- this is the only time you'll probably ever hear me defending Omarosa, and it certainly won't be her actions.",
  "And in this case, it is hard to reach any conclusion other than the decision to reverse OPR's decision was itself motivated at least largely by politics.",
  "I actually -- you know, if this is legitimately something they feel that has happened, then they should go forward, and I don't want to jeopardize that.",
  "That's what Trump did wrong last year when he said this:\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREPORTER: You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides?",
  "If he had a conversation with him where he said, go easy on him if you can, it matters a lot more than if he never had a conversation like that at all.",
  "When you punch me in the nose for being Italian and you say I'm somehow less than, am I in the same moral place when I punch you back for saying that?",
  "That's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same petty violence.",
  "Omarosa's story has changed more than once during her media blitz, but the question tonight is how much damage her bridge-bombing campaign is having.",
  "That's what we should want as the American people is to make sure that this is a thorough and concise and effective investigation into these issues.",
  "PANETTA: Well, she obviously was getting a lot of questions related to Roger Stone and whether or not he was involved in working with the Russians.",
  "CUOMO: It is a matter of fact, which is one reason the Omarosa story mattered, because that was the best he could get and look what happened there.",
  "I think we should expect more professionalism out of people given the title of assistant to the president, and she did not exhibit that behavior.",
  "Big news: Peter Strzok is out, fired from the FBI for those text messages the president loves to claim undercut the entire Russia investigation.",
  "And so, if you come to him and, you know, apologize a little bit and want to work with him on something new, he'll forgive you and move forward.",
  "Since that, he has gotten -- the proportion has completely flip-flopped, and Pete's actually gotten an outpouring of support even before today.",
  "CUOMO: Now, of course, their policy on devices is an honor code one,\n\n\n\nand for the speculation of it being wrong, I don't think it's illegal.",
  "I don't think what Omarosa did is going to fall under the two applicable statutes about access or dissemination of defense information, right?",
  "PANETTA: No, I don't think so because the conversation really concerned a personnel matter related to something other than national security.",
  "CUOMO: She is a window, though, into an absence, which is that there's just not diversity in this White House even by --\n\n\n\nRYE: Absolutely.",
  "The idea of draining the swamp, as I joked last week, but I mean it -- he just dug this big moat around maybe where his wall is going to go.",
  "It's not about being right in the eyes of the law, but you also have to know what's right and wrong and immoral, in a good and evil sense.",
  "One man who knows all of this stuff is former CIA director, former secretary of defense, former Bill Clinton chief of staff, Leon Panetta.",
  "So I think that there's some truth there that his intermediary was Randy Credico, and hopefully, the truth will come out in terms of that.",
  "DAVIS: My family and I have had dinner with him, and at that time in 2016, and asked him these questions before any of this was an issue.",
  "But what's interesting is I haven't heard this same criticism by Republicans leveled at Steve Bannon, who pretty much did the same thing.",
  "But it sounded to me like he had some pretty legitimate issues he needed to raise with her surrounding her treatment of her high office.",
  "CUOMO: The criticism that this probe has been going on too long, if he had anything with collusion, we would know by now, it should end.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who is the most prominent high level adviser to the president on the West Wing staff right now?",
  "But I am arguing that Trump was wrong to create a moral equivalency between bigots and those who oppose them, making them equal wrongs.",
  "But assuming, as Rudy calls in the alternative, yes, they had that conversation, and he said, try to see your way clear of helping him.",
  "So be that as it may, you are not one to shy away from controversy or conflict and I know you're not going to let somebody shut you up.",
  "Omarosa drops tapes, accusations left and right, including somehow capturing John Kelly firing her in the White House situation room.",
  "And we have Leon Panetta, former director of the CIA, secretary of defense, and White House chief of staff under President Clinton.",
  "Inasmuch as he says that Roger was much more direct and strong in terms of saying that he thought he had some access and knowledge.",
  "Thank God there was no repeat of what we suffered through a year ago, but we saw some wrongs and we need to remember what is right.",
  "So, speaking of making America great again, somehow it became synonymous with making America white again, starting in the cabinet.",
  "So you told him watch out for this guy, but Roger believed he might have known something about what was happening with WikiLeaks?",
  "According to \"The New York Times,\" they did an analysis, in the first six weeks of the Trump presidency, take a look at this, OK?",
  "But when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot, even physical, are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting?",
  "But that was a joke, and Sam Nunberg tends to call you 50 times in the course of 10 minutes and e-mail consistently, annoyingly.",
  "I think that there's cause for concern based on that they just want to believe something happened, which I don't believe it did.",
  "Why would that make --\n\n\n\nDAVIS: -- I think Roger was just putting him off and just making a joke like, please leave me alone.",
  "DAVIS: Well, I think that there was an e-mail that he says jokingly to Nunberg, saying, I'm having dinner with Julian Assange.",
  "And then since the firing was announced, he has been really gratified by a lot of messages of support from across the country.",
  "GOELMAN: Certainly, the deputy director and the director can countermand a decision by OPR, but it doesn't happen very often.",
  "The closest that we've been able to get to knowing where Bob Mueller's probe is headed, at least with respect to Roger Stone.",
  "We're going to talk Russia and the apparent White House security breach as Omarosa leaks a recording from the Situation Room.",
  "Are people who go to war against an evil regime on the same moral ground as those they seek to stop from oppressing the weak?",
  "My belief is Bob Mueller, if he doesn't have the evidence to be able to support those charges, he is not going to bring them.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: No, and he proved he still believes that when he wrote this before this year's first anniversary.",
  "So while Omarosa is pushing out a book -- and, yes, I get the criticism, that what she's doing is trying to help sell books.",
  "Think about: civil rights activist, were they the same morally as the bigots, as the racist with whom they exchanged blows.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You know, to be fair to Kellyanne, other than Ben Carson, she really had no big names to offer.",
  "JENNINGS: Well, look --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You can't talk about this White House hiring only the best and not smile.",
  "CUOMO: Then why would Roger Stone -- now, he's no -- right, he's not stranger to doing things with people he doesn't like.",
  "I think the point remains, right, that you can have the best and the brightest and the best and the brightest be black.",
  "You want to have diversity because you want -- shouldn't he want his cabinet to reflect the great diversity of America?",
  "She worked for the Trump campaign and has been a focus of the Russia probe, that has been a focus of the Russia probe.",
  "But the turn out of white supremacists was thankfully pathetic, which is why I didn't have to go there and cover it.",
  "It's been one year since Heather Heyer was killed for standing up to hate, and our thoughts still go to her family.",
  "Another is the news of the FBI agent who was kicked off the Russia probe over his anti-Trump texts has been canned.",
  "Another big story, Omarosa's taping and her firing and what she means about the diversity not in this White House.",
  "So, before this was such a colossal undertaking and event here, we were already getting straight answers from him.",
  "You know, Roger's not particularly technologically savvy with some of the things going on in technology nowadays.",
  "When you get hired into any White House for any president at any level, your job is to serve the American people.",
  "Whether they have the evidence to actually make that case, I think still is a question for Bob Mueller to decide.",
  "And I will call on you please, sir, Mr. Panetta, to come back and give us some pearls of wisdom as we learn more.",
  "He's trying to break the back of the --\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who there is on the White House staff right now?",
  "Those hateful few who take solace and encouragement from the president's efforts, my message to you is simple.",
  "He's going to do everything necessary to make sure that they are careful in the pursuit of this investigation.",
  "But no question that they have concerns that Roger Stone may have done something that he shouldn't have done?",
  "DAVIS: You know, I think they're genuinely concerned about whether or not any collusion happened with Russia.",
  "And then we got about a page and a half letter from the deputy director saying, I've reversed this decision.",
  "Usually the rules of evidence, they get objections and they get jammed up and a judge would have to decide.",
  "CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Three generations of Cuomos like your Facebook show -- my mom, my wife, my daughter.",
  "If he doesn't like Strzok, whether it's the right call or the wrong call, it's his call to make, isn't it?",
  "And unless you're justified in defending yourself and you hit someone, you're a thug, you're a criminal.",
  "He wanted to do it in a place that was secure, and that's probably why they went to the Situation Room.",
  "SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, we need to hear from John Kelly I guess at some point.",
  "Did you come away from your Session today believing that the investigators are coming for Roger Stone?",
  "But, again, it surprises me that the precautions weren't taken to make sure that it truly was secure.",
  "I think what's interesting is, Scott, you brought up a good point about diversity in the White House.",
  "And you will be opposed at every turn because what you are about is wrong, and fighting you is right.",
  "DAVIS: Well, I think -- I think Randy Credico had some information that seemed credible at the time.",
  "DAVIS: Well, there's a relationship between the special counsel prosecutor and those juror members.",
  "JENNINGS: I think they have some -- I think they have some great people working in the White House.",
  "CUOMO: Well, we haven't seen him bring one thus far, so we'll see how it goes the rest of the time.",
  "And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right.",
  "He has a rapport with them, and he's able to, you know, lead these questions in a negative manner.",
  "DAVIS: I'm pretty sure I said something to the extent of why are you friends with that douche bag.",
  "The special counsel's office has a rapport with these jurors, and the questions were very leading.",
  "Her name is Kristin Davis, and she's here for her first interview since her grand jury testimony.",
  "Half the time Roger Stone wasn't in charge -- you know, there were numerous hands in his Twitter.",
  "(COMMERCIJAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway is getting heat for this.",
  "LEMON: Why can't all the best people -- remember he said, I'm going to hire all the best people.",
  "And the response from him at that time was, I've not had any direct contact with Julian Assange.",
  "And since Roger was such an integral part of the campaign, they're really following all avenues.",
  "So, I think that is what's really fascinating that, all of a sudden, Omarosa is super demonized.",
  "RYE: What we know is that there's no end to the desires of this president in receiving flattery.",
  "You know, Donald Trump, number of white men in the first cabinet of each president, 18 for him.",
  "And why does he therefore have unprecedented support from these fringe elements of white power?",
  "CONWAY: It's important that he's -- well, the president works with Secretary Carson every day.",
  "Peter Strzok is out, but his attorney says there's a problem, and there may be a fight coming.",
  "But the problem is they don't like you to use your First Amendment right to freedom of speech.",
  "But why would he listen to Randy Credico about WikiLeaks if he doesn't like him or trust him?",
  "I think that's completely inappropriate for the chief executive of the government to do that.",
  "He's very committed to protecting the country, and he was a great counterintelligence agent.",
  "Proof they lost membership after being exposed again last year as a bunch of hateful losers?",
  "Antifa,\n\n\n\nor whomever, anarchists or malcontent or misguided, they are also wrong to hit.",
  "If he were to call and say, I want to get rid of the attorney general, he gets rid of him.",
  "CUOMO: Well, certainly on the numbers, that's a tough fact for the president to deal with.",
  "You know, what does that tell you, Scott, about what the priority is in this White House?",
  "So everything is taken out of context, pushed down the path that they want it to be down.",
  "And so, their line of questioning really did revolve around whether or not this happened.",
  "DAVIS: Well, and I think Roger has publicly said that his intermediary was Randy Credico.",
  "They're still in force online, but they didn't have the guts to show up, and that's good.",
  "DAVIS: Mostly just my relationship with Roger Stone, the sort of work that I do for him.",
  "DAVIS: Right now, I'm hoping a nail art boutique in Harlem called Bombshell Beauty Lab.",
  "It wasn't enforced here, and it clearly was a breach of security in the Situation Room.",
  "CUOMO: Do you think that Roger Stone had contact with WikiLeaks and knew what they had?",
  "They covered their faces, confronted police and berated journalists and that was wrong.",
  "A protester uses their voice, song, slang, slurs, there's a huge range, but it is talk.",
  "As we learn more, he's always welcome to come back here and make his side of the case.",
  "Maybe he didn't record anyone, right, but this is certainly the same type of behavior.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJENNINGS: I don't have a list of the White House staff in front of me.",
  "CUOMO: Leon Panetta -- that's a big name from politics -- White House chief of staff.",
  "So, let's leave it here for now, counselor, until we have new facts on the situation.",
  "You're just somebody who's going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong.",
  "It shows, I guess, what this president's priorities and how he feels about diversity.",
  "And those types of questions, even though they're OK, it doesn't mean they're right.",
  "You know, there's five or six people helping manage that process, automated systems.",
  "He is here to make the case to you that this firing is not about the text messages.",
  "If the president of the United States doesn't want you in the FBI, should you stay?",
  "And at the last minute, that was countermanded by the higher ups, and he was fired.",
  "And then the number of women and minorities in the first cabinet of each president.",
  "What do you make of what we are seeing in the White House on just this one matter?",
  "That's how senior administration officials describe the mood among Trump staffers.",
  "CUOMO: Is it true that he was getting a lot of pressure from colleagues to resign?",
  "CUOMO: So when you got in there, how long were you in there before the grand jury?",
  "And then you have the president of the United States tweeting, just fired Strzok.",
  "So, now, you're saying questions for people who don't really have the background.",
  "You can have the best and the brightest, and the best and the brightest be women.",
  "DNALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think there's blame on both sides.",
  "The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division.",

  "JENNINGS: Here's how I would staff -- here's how I would staff a White House.",
  "She comes away thinking, I think these guys are trying to indict Roger Stone.",
  "And whatever he was talking about on Twitter, he didn't think was a big deal.",
  "And so --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Do you remember telling Roger, don't listen to this guy?",
  "CUOMO: So there was no question about we think you did this -- none of that?",

  "CUOMO: Kristin Davis, thank you for your candor in coming on to talk to us.",
  "I'm not saying that they're uneducated, but it could be a mixed bag, right?",
