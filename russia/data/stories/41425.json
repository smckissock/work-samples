  "Limestone working and horses were the dominant features of the life at Rose Cottage: the Joyces when they arrived took every advantage of both the presence of a large British military encampment and the rapid development of Fermoy town itself, supplying mounts to the one and building supplies to the other' Rose Cottage was in the heart of hunting country, and J. R. O'Flanagan's 1844 book on the Blackwater river -- his family lived in Grange Farm House across the lane -- is full of tales of the local hunt and its dashing ways.",
  "Given the almost princely importance since medieval times of the Lords of Kerry, patrons of Gaelic poets, friends and relations of those in high places, and the high style in which they lived in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the trusted retainer and agent of the family was in a position that can only have bestowed on Sean Mor Seoighe's descendants a lingering sense of their unique importance in the great scheme of Irish life.",
  "CHAPTER ONE\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce\n\nThe Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce's Father\n\n\n\nBy JOHN WYSE JACKSON and PETER COSTELLO\n\n\n\nSt. Martin's Press\n\nRead the Review\n\nAncestral Joyces\n\nIn the last decades of James Joyce's life, visitors to his Paris flats at 2 Square Robiac, and later at 7 rue Edmond Valentin, found themselves sitting under the benign gaze of a series of family portraits in heavy gilded frames.",
  "Patrick Weston in his Old Irish Folk Music and Songs described something of the life they shared, and remembered a typical outing:\n\nMy home in Glenosheen, in the heart of the Ballyhoura Mountains, was a home of music and song: they were in the air of the valley; you heard them everywhere -- sung, played, whistled; and they were mixed up with the people's pastimes, occupations and daily life.",
  "An emotive photograph taken in 1938 by Gisele Freund shows the writer (exhausted by Work in Progress, his working title for Finnegans Wake) relaxing en famille with his son Giorgio and grandson Stephen beneath this very portrait of the infant's great-grandfather, which had by then been transferred to Giorgio's home in the rue Scheffer, in the fashionable Passy district of Paris.",
  "The house had impressed the topographer Charles Smith in 1750, with its extent and its lavish style, its canals and garden vistas; but twenty-five years later Arthur Young visited the estate on his famous tour of Ireland in October 1776 and found that `All is desolation and everything in ruins' -- the walls and roof were being removed by thieves and the trees cut down.",
  "She was a nice, amiable and good girl -- too good, to encounter the rough seas of this world; where she can scarcely escape the meeting of many a rock and many a breaker -- but, little as her religious training has been, may she have learnt in her short Noviciate, to look up only to the one eye, that steadily and securely guides, each bark of this uncertain life.",
  "Though the Tithe Applotment survey of the 1820s places the Joyces only in the northern part of East Cork, by the 1850s several families of them were found scattered further south, often around Youghal and especially in Cork City itself, where there were some fourteen households, in one of which John Stanislaus Joyce was already a bawling baby.",
  "Second, that though some members of the family, such as those settled in the hill country at Glenosheen, were happy to retain and cultivate their Gaelic culture (which they then put to literary use), others were keener to take hold of the commercial advantages offered by the development of Ireland and Cork in the early nineteenth century.",
  "By the terms of the settlement John O'Connell assigned 1000 [pounds sterling] to James Augustine Joyce as a marriage portion; and the bride's grandfather, out of the great love he bore him (according to the deed), gave him a half share in lands at Skahard (now a public park) and on Goat Island in the Douglas river.",
  "On 16 June 1954, with Myles na Gopaleen (otherwise Brian O'Nolan and Flann O'Brien), John Ryan, Anthony Cronin, Patrick Kavanagh and Samuel Beckett's friend A. J. Leventhal of Trinity College, he went on the very first Bloomsday expedition, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set.",
  "Mixed up with these agrarian troubles were the activities of Rockites, a group, strong in the vicinity, who were linked to the Whiteboys but had also been inspired by the writings of Pastorini into a millenarian belief that the end of the world was imminent and that all the Protestants would be destroyed.",
  "have been the unhappy wife of a Joyce -- whom Stephen Dedalus sees as `a type of her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling a stranger to her bed'?",
  "Some time about 1680, William FitzMaurice, nineteenth of the Lords of Kerry (other more successful Anglo-Norman settlers), required a new steward for the household at his family seat at Lixnaw on the Brick river, a few miles south-west of Listowel in the Barony of Clanmaurice in North Kerry.",
  "Though the new Earl of Kerry was a terrible tyrant, he was well managed by his prudent and exceedingly wealthy wife, who (according to Lord Lansdowne) `furnished several houses, supported a style of living superior to any family whatever in Ireland, and with all this improved his fortune'.",
  "James Joyce's statement to Gorman that his father came `from an old Cork family that once possessed extensive holdings' leaves it unclear whether he was referring to some medieval context, or to the situation at about 1800, approximately when George Joyce's son James was born.",
  "But more importantly, we can now place John Stanislaus exactly in the course of Irish history, in that culturally significant shift from the medieval Gaelic-speaking life of Sean Mor Seoighe in 1680 to the anglophone entrepreneurism fostered by the growth of commerce in Cork.",
  "There (in a vignette recalled by John Stanislaus's mother), the great man would walk arm in arm with her grandfather, Charles O'Connell, up and down the street between the Franciscan chapel and South Main Street, both men wearing the knee-breeches fashionable in those days.",
  "From him it was bought in 1856 by John Sadlier, the notorious Irish politician who brought about the demise of the first Irish Independent Party of the 1850s,\n\nIn the middle ages the main road crossed the River Blackwater by a bridge just to the west of present-day Fermoy.",
  "In view of the interest which his grandfather had taken in his own lineage, it is very unlikely that Tom Joyce's claim to a relationship with the author of Ulysses was false: these Joyces had no doubts about who they were, given their family obsession with history.",
  "Though we had pipers, fiddlers, fifers, whistlers and singers of our own, wandering musicians were welcomed; and from every one some choice air or song that struck our fancy was sure to be learned and stored up to form part of an ever-growing stock of minstrelsy.",
  "His grandfather had been one of the reporters for the Freeman's Journal of the famous 1891 meeting in Committee Room 15 in the Houses of Parliament that brought about Parnell's downfall, while his doctor father had attended at the death of James's brother George.",
  "In the middle of the nineteenth century the nation-wide valuation records show that the vast majority of Joyces were still to be found either in Galway (some 427 households in eighteen locations), or in Mayo just to the north (214 households in nine locations).",
  "I had as a boy on many occasions met the historian, Patrick Weston Joyce; and [Robert Dwyer Joyce] the author of The Boys of Wexford had also this family characteristic, as I was told by my father who knew him intimately [as a medical student] in the sixties.",
  "On the road is Kildorrery, a little over a mile to the west of which lies Bowen's Court, where the Glenosheen Joyces often went for the fair, and beyond that is Doneraile, long the parish of novelist Canon Sheehan (in whom James Joyce was keenly interested).",
  "There might have been half a dozen groups in that part of the bog, all near each other, and they all sat down to dinner at the same time: glorious smoking hot floury savoury potatoes, salt herrings (hot like the potatoes) and good wholesome blathach, i.e.",
  "Indeed the image of Parnell as a stag flashing his antlers on the mountainside may have been suggested to him by his boyhood reading of one of Robert Dwyer Joyce's ballads about the area, or by the old tale of the `uncatchable' stag of the Ballyhouras.",
  "The Cork Post Office Directory for 1842-3 lists James Joyce Horse Trainer, 12 Winthrop Street' and James Joyce Salt Lime Manufacturer, 16 White Street and South Terrace' -- again the connection with horses and lime goes back to Rose Cottage and beyond.",
  "The vital love of language and music would take a different form, blossoming later in the vigour of John Stanislaus's witty speech, the precision of James Joyce's writings and the love both had for song, which reached down even to James's son Giorgio.",
  "On this occasion Peggy Moynihan ... sat willingly on a turf bank ... and she gave us the `Clar Bog Deil' in Irish, with intense passion, while the people, old and young -- including myself and my little brother Robert -- listened, mute and spellbound.",
  "Based close by, over the mountains from Leenane, one of the great families of Galway, the O'Malleys, were at both Westport and Letterfrack, using Killary Harbour and Ballynakill Harbour for their maritime exploits along the `west coast of Ireland.",
  "Already known as a poet, he emigrated to Boston, where he practised medicine, at the same time achieving immense literary success with Ballads of Irish Chivalry (1872) and Deirdre (1876), which sold 10,000 copies in its first week of publication.",
  "On a visit to Cork as a child in 1894 with John Stanislaus, the young James was to hear his great-grandfather, James Joyce the elder, from whom his own name came, extolled by one of the older generation of Corkonians as a `fierce old fire-eater'.",
  "The Guinnesses as landlords had usurped the ancient patrimony of the Joyces: but John Stanislaus would live to claim that the first Lord Ardilaun, then Sir Arthur Edward Guinness, had been defeated for Parliament as a result of his campaigning.",
  "Patrick Weston Joyce (1827-1914) became the celebrated author of Irish Names of Places, a book familiar to at least six generations of Irish readers, and of many other works on Irish history, folklore and music, including Old Celtic Romances.",
  "Roibeard married an Ann Howard and from her family, the Howards of Howardstown, got in 1783 a parcel of marginal land at Glenosheen (the Glen of Oisin), a hamlet in the northern foothills of the Ballyhoura, Mountains, west of Ballyorgan.",
  "The family trade of the Joyces of Connaught was working with limestone, as lime-burners, stonemasons and builders; the family is still associated with the limestone and marble quarries of Connemara in the Maum Valley and around Kylemore.",
  "In about 1750 some of the Lixnaw descendants of Sean Mor, including Bernard Rua and his family, moved out of Kerry to settle on better lands that the FitzMaurices had also given them at Athlacca, further to the east in County Limerick.",
  "Ellen's schooling with the Ursuline nuns was the epitome of respectable education in those days, and her leatherbound French prayer books were still in the family attic in the 1880s, `the symbol of culture in Cork when she was a girl.'",
  "James Starkey, otherwise the poet `Seumas O'Sullivan', an early friend of James Joyce, who lent him money, boots and a toothbrush when he left Ireland in 1904, was aware of the family resemblance between these branches of the Joyces.",
  "Aside from the sea-blue eyes, perhaps, too, a similar cast of face had made him aware of a family connection, for Tom Joyce resembled both John Stanislaus Joyce and Stanislaus Joyce, and they in turn resembled P. W. and R. D. Joyce.",
  "It has been suggested that they were actually Joyes of Wexford, or had some connection with the English Joyces, perhaps even with the regicide George `Cornet' Joyce, executioner of Charles I, who disappeared from Rotterdam in 1670.",
  "Not only did James Joyce own a copy of the arms framed as a decoration, he had them stamped on the binding of a volume of manuscript poems which he had specially made for Nora Joyce, after a difficult passage in their `marriage'.",
  "It was great horse country, and it is surely here that the family began in earnest a long and fruitful interest in the horse, an aristocratic animal that brought status and authority to its owner in eighteenth-century Ireland.",
  "During the jaunt, in a pub in Irishtown where they had paused hoping to hear a broadcast of the Ascot Gold Cup, Tom Joyce regaled the party with a beautiful rendering of one of James Joyce's favourite songs, `Silent, O Moyle'.",
  "After his father's death, James Joyce admitted to close friends just what he owed him, not only as a man but as a writer: much of his own work had come directly from his father, and from his father's circle of Dublin friends.",
  "But Lixnaw was a special place to be, and the work continued, for Lady Anne further extended the house, adding two fine wings, an elegant library and a chapel with copies of much-admired Raphael cartoons at Hampton Court.",
  "John Stanislaus Joyce was one day to congratulate his son James on `his receiving such an Honour from his Majesty' when he was awarded a small grant from the Royal Literary Fund: Sean Mor would have felt similarly proud.",
  "Our Joyces' remote ancestor, George Joyce of Fermoy, was recalled (by James Joyce for his first biographer Herbert Gorman) as `a man of property' (an ambiguous phrase in the circumstances of eighteenth-century Ireland).",
  "The road comes down from Glanworth to a place on the outskirts of Fermoy a little to the east of the grand house and estate of Castlehyde -- celebrated in poetry as `Sweet Castle Hyde', attributed to Robert Dwyer Joyce.",
  "Francis FitzMaurice was `a simple young Irish peer', according to Horace Walpole, `who had married an elderly Irishwoman that had been divorced on his account, and had wasted a vast estate in the idlest ostentation'.",
  "George Joyce, the earliest Joyce to be mentioned by James and the one who moved to Rose Cottage, was likely to have been born in south Limerick in or soon after 1776, and to have been named after George Washington.",
  "Almost the last act of Daniel O'Connell's legal career was to defend at the Cork Assizes the Doneraile Conspirators, twenty-one men from the town who were charged with conspiracy to murder various Cork worthies.",
  "Given how much building was to be done over the next years by the FitzMaurices, it is likely that Sean Mor followed the trade of Tim Finnegan in the ballad of `Finnegan's Wake' and was set in charge of the work.",
  "(John Stanislaus imagined that the Guinnesses were in fact originally from the same part of the country as the Joyces; but this is not true: the first of them was, it seems, a Cromwellian settler from Cornwall.)",
  "Of Lixnaw Old Court, that seat of culture and refinement which had been admired by so many, where the ancestors of John Stanislaus Joyce learnt the value of hard work and patronage, almost nothing now remains.",

  "A fin d'eterniser quatre generations de Joyce, l'ecrivain posa selon son propre desir avec Giorgio et Stephen sous le portrait de son pere, John Stanislaus Joyce, peint par l'artiste irlandais, Patrick Tuohy.",
  "Here also was the home of Elizabeth St Leger, the daughter of the First Lord Doneraile, who overheard a Masonic ceremony in her father's house, and was enrolled as the first (but not the only) female Mason.",
  "This was the situation when in 1847 his only son, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, the daughter of John O'Connell, whose family was connected with the great Daniel O'Connell, the Liberator.",
  "But as readers of Somerville & Ross will realise, to follow the local hunt was no real indication of superior social standing in rural Ireland; it demanded nothing more than the ability to keep a horse.",
  "A deed of 16 July 1830 records the purchase by George Joyce of a property at White Street from Richard Gould, a salt and lime maker (listed in Slater's Royal Directory for 1846, still in the same area).",
  "But as John Stanislaus was the only son of an only son of an only son, there seemed to be no immediate Joyce relatives by whom the family traditions in which he set such great store could be confirmed.",
  "Within a generation or two there would be built a mock ruin which could be seen from the house, a building devoted to cockfighting, a family mausoleum and all the appurtenances of a grand country seat.",
  "The O'Malleys -- of whom the so-called pirate Queen, Grace O'Malley or Granuaile, was one -- were friendly with the Kerry FitzMaurices, then a Jacobite family and later opposed to William and Mary.",
  "(There is a tradition, current among the Joyces of Acres, outside Fermoy, that in fact it was two brothers Joyce who had come to Kerry from the Kylemore-Ballynakill district close to Letterfrack.",
  "Though the soil around Lixnaw was not rich, it could be much improved by dressing the fields with lime, and no doubt these enterprising and loyal Joyces made the best of what they had been given.",
  "On coming of age in 1761 Francis Thomas, who did not care much for the old house, abandoned it and afterwards sold his Kerry estates in 1783 to the Hare family of Cork (later the Lords Listowel).",
  "By now it seems certain that old George Joyce was dead; his son James, as head of the family, continued to consolidate the Joyce assets, his name appearing frequently in the records at this time.",
  "The cottage's position and its extensive stabling suggests that the connection with horses was not only for the army but also for stage coaches, then the usual means of transport through Ireland.",

  "Their eldest son was Robert Joyce, known as Roibeard an Gaelgoir, perhaps because he had a fund of traditional tales and poems (already becoming more precious as the use of Gaelic declined).",

  "Few who could claim an immediate link with the Liberator were shy of proclaiming the fact: he was the most famous man in Ireland and the Joyces were proud to have married into his clan.",
  "As there were Joyces recorded at only two locations in Clare, the county lying directly between Galway and Limerick, it is improbable that the clan had spread south through that county.",
  "John, though a family name among John Stanislaus Joyce's forebears, was not later used by the Joyces of Glenosheen, perhaps because it was in common use in another line of the family.)",

  "John Stanislaus Joyce was able to trace his family line back to his great-grandfather, a certain George Joyce, who flourished about the end of the eighteenth century.",
