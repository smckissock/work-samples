  "Obviously, I will need more than one example!”\n\nIan Bremmer, the head of the Eurasia Group and a frequent Trump critic, suggested that China wouldn't have gone along with the vote if not for the current occupant of the White House.",
  "It was a collective victory https://t.co/0mBgdkE6nx — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) August 6, 2017\n\nAndrew Exum, a Middle East scholar who also writes for the Atlantic and has said Trump requires an “intervention,” agreed.",
