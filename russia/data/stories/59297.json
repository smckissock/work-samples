  "— Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nMeadows said Americans deserve to know if their government is spying on them in secret and recently called for the appointment of a second special counsel to “investigate the investigators.”\n\nWATCH:\n\nSo the bottom line is this: if, in 2016, the DOJ and FBI used an unverified, Clinton/DNC paid-for dossier to spy on American citizens (and political opponents) in the Trump campaign, that is as wrong as it gets.",
  "If the Department of Justice used information like that as a key part of getting a surveillance warrant, it would be a HUGE problem — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nMeadows said GOP Rep. Jim Jordan had requested information from the FBI about whether or not authorities used the Russian dossier to obtain a spying warrant, but the Bureau refused to show the congressmen the FISA application.",
  "THREAD: Because through all the “memo” news and headlines, it’s critical to remember why this issue is important and why it should matter to everyday Americans — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nWhat this issue is all about: whether the Department of Justice and FBI, under President Obama, abused their surveillance authority against American citizens and political opponents.",
  "— Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nMeadows also mentioned the Strzok-Page texts, but he directed focus specifically to the Fusion GPS dossier, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, and how it could be to obtain a “surveillance warrant.”\n\nNow, pause: we know about the Peter Strzok/Lisa Page texts, the “missing” texts, the McCabe concerns, etc.",

  "— Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nIf any Department of Justice, Republican or Democrat, put their thumb on the scale for the sake of politics–it would undermine the very fabric of who we are as a nation.",

  "Republican Rep. Mark Meadows tweeted a walkthrough of a potential political scandal involving the FBI and the Obama Department of Justice spying on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign.",
  "— Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 2, 2018\n\nI know we live in a hyper-partisan environment, and I know it can be easy to disregard any inquiry like this as party politics.",
