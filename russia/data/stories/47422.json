  "The scrutiny was touched off when The New York Times reported Facebook shared more data with phone companies than it had previously disclosed — and intensified when Facebook revealed that Huawei was among the companies that had partnerships for access to user information.",
  "\"Silicon Valley would be well served by the CEOs, other than when they're in a crisis situation like Facebook is now, to come and share with us in Congress what their strategies are, what their agreements are, what their recommendations are,\" Walden said.",
  "Meanwhile, Walden, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, reiterated his call for more tech CEOs to come testify before his committee, saying Congress is unsatisfied with what it has heard from Facebook and the rest of the industry.",

  "\"Sure looks like Zuckerberg lied to Congress about whether users have 'complete control' over who sees our data on Facebook,\" he tweeted.",
  "\"I don't know what he knew and what he withheld and what he didn't withhold and what kind of coaching he got — I can't comment on that.",
  "\"Mark spent over 10 hours answering hundreds of questions put to him by lawmakers,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.",
  "\"The arrangements in question had been highly visible for years — with many manufacturers advertising these features.",
