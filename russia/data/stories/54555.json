  "If Putin did decide on some major military adventure now, he would get much more than he bargained for,\" Mark Galeotti, a senior research fellow at the Institute of International Relations in Prague and a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote recently in Vox.",
  "\"Putin appeared to be willing to offer certain compromises on Syria, expecting the West to reciprocate on Ukraine, decreasing their support to the Kyiv government,\" Aleksandr Kokcharov, Russia defense analyst at IHS Jane's 360, told Newsweek recently.",
  "But while Putin may have suffered a tactical diplomatic defeat in Hangzhou, he clearly hasn't given up on his strategic goal of dominating Ukraine, even as Kyiv makes impressive strides in reforming and modernizing its once-ramshackle armed forces.",
  "As military analyst Michael Kofman, a fellow at the Kennan Institute, wrote recently in Foreign Policy, the bases Russia is constructing along Ukraine's borders look like permanent garrisons, complete with soccer fields and long-term housing.",
  "\"The Russians know this, and their military moves are instead meant to ratchet up the political pressure on Kyiv -- and to prepare just in case some day Ukraine feels strong enough to try to take back the Donbas by force.\"",
  "\"Russia isn't about to escalate the war in Ukraine's east, but it is reorienting its forces to surround and contain Ukraine for years to come in a process that has been largely overlooked,\" Kofman wrote.",
  "Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\nAnd with its military buildup, Moscow also appears to be gearing up for the long game -- a protracted, tense, and sometimes bloody standoff with Kyiv that Putin thinks he can win.",
  "It was in this context that Putin pushed for a joint meeting on the sidelines of the G20 with Merkel and Hollande -- but without Poroshenko -- aimed at resolving the Ukraine conflict behind Kyiv's back.",
  "Feigning outrage, the Kremlin then abruptly pulled out of planned four-party talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Francois Hollande.",
  "And all the while, Russia moved tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine's borders and conducted menacing military exercises, sparking fears that an all-out invasion was in the cards.",
  "Moscow ginned up a fake crisis in Crimea in August, accusing Ukraine of sending a team of agent saboteurs to the annexed peninsula to carry out terrorist acts.",
  "REUTERS/Damir Sagolj\n\nMoreover, Hollande called for a resumption of four-party talks on Ukraine -- the so-called Normandy format -- and Putin acquiesced.",
  "In fact, Russia's actions in and around Ukraine over the past month appear to have been, at least in part, a big psy-op in the run-up to the summit.",
  "So the elaborate psy-op the Kremlin launched last month, when it accused Ukraine of plotting terrorist attacks in Crimea, fell flat on its face.",
  "By the end of 2017, its forces will be better positioned to conduct an incursion or threaten regime change in Kyiv than they ever were in 2014.\"",
  "\"Putin is still where he was two months ago, before the recent reescalation in east Ukraine and military buildup in Crimea,\" Kokcharov said.",
  "Merkel and Hollande agreed only to meet Putin separately, where each pushed him to fulfill Moscow's obligations under the Minsk cease-fire.",
  "And to stress that point, the French and German leaders then met with US President Barack Obama to discuss Ukraine -- without Putin.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin sits before the start of the opening ceremony of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou.",
  "Servicemen march during Ukraine's Independence Day military parade in central Kiev, Ukraine, August 24, 2016.",
  "Thomson Reuters\n\nOne of the most significant things about the G20 summit was something that didn't happen.",
  "Leaders pose for pictures during the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016.",
  "\"Russia will retain escalation dominance over Ukraine for the foreseeable future.",
  "Both refused to cut any deals about Ukraine without Poroshenko's involvement.",
  "Create a fake crisis and then offer to help resolve it on Moscow's terms.",
  "\"Ukraine's military is now larger, tougher, and more ready than ever.",
  "The militarization of Crimea, meanwhile, continues apace.",
  "But Vladimir Putin sure wanted it to.",
  "It's a classic Kremlin tactic.",
  "Hangzhou didn't become Yalta.",
  "China didn't become Munich.",
  "But it didn't work."
