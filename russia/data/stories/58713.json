  "Barack Obama in the month before the 2016 elections, and I will read and I will quote , \"No serious person out there would suggest that somehow you can even rig America's elections, no evidence that it has happened in the past, which is not true, and number two, or that it could happen in this election, and I invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and to go out there and try to get votes.\"",
  "Yes, then they got a foreign entity, foreign spy by the name of Christopher Steele, he put together phony opposition research, and now the infamous dossier, which has been debunked, filled with lies, Russian lies, Russian propaganda, and all paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to manipulate you, the American people in the lead up to the 2016 election.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Now, of course, this meeting comes just days after the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictments of 12 Russian agents who were accused of hacking the DNC and the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, even though the DNC, they have refused to turn over their hack server to the FBI.",
  "So they have a treaty where they work together with the United States, because everyone says we don't have an extradition treaty, but they have a treaty where they were together, and his prosecutors were prosecuted, and he said that Robert Mueller's people could go with them, but they probably won't.",
  "Now, with this is a backdrop, the president moves forward with his very important diplomacy and as a leader of the free world, President Trump, he must meet with the leaders of Russia, China, North Korea, and others, as long as he is not spending $150 billion of your cash and other currencies.",
  "They are not paying their fair share for their own national defense, even criticizing the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and her country's lucrative energy deals Vladimir Putin's Russia, which creates a dangerous dependency on Russia and energy, which is the lifeblood of their economy.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Brennan maybe embarrassed over the fact, you're right, that in the Obama administration he may have things to hide over the FISA warrants of Carter Page that was done, the intelligence, just wait, you seem to have something.",
  "If you think that Obama didn't know what was going on, when you watch -- and I said it today, with President Putin, when you watch Peter Strzok's performance, the lover of Lisa Page, when you watch that performance, the FBI, I tell you, I know so many people in the FBI.",
  "But here's I think the most important part that we got to get into and that is, at some point, we need to have the specific evidence and the double standard is glaring in this particular case as it relates to the servers, as it relates to the e-mails that are missing.",
  "Here now with reaction on set, the author of the book \"Why We Fight,\" well, he's actually in Washington, national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Fox News chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, Fox News contributors, Sara Carter and Daniel Hoffman.",
  "CARTER: What a terrorist nation like Iran, moving money to Iran when everybody knew that the Iranians were probably one of the most aided and abetted terrorists throughout the globe in the killing of Americans, it's extraordinary now they're going after him.",
  "And President Putin said that, one of the early things that he said when we started, he said it's really a shame because we could do so much good, whether it's humanitarian aid throughout the Middle East whether it's not just Syria, so many different things.",
  "Former CIA director, you know the guy that was a former communist turned CNN paid hack, John Brennan, he actually tweeted out: Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.",

  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\n\nANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC: We have never had a summit with the KGB spy master, someone who has, you know, completely studied and examined Donald Trump, and a president who spends the weekend golfing and has not been preparing.",
  "Other stinging economic sanctions against Russia have also increased, and U.S. forces on the ground in Syria inflicted heavy casualties on even Russian soldiers during a skirmish earlier this year, an enormous embarrassment for Vladimir Putin.",

  "And I had to reiterate the things I said several times including during our personal contacts that the Russian state has never interfered and it's not going to interfere into internal American affairs including the election process.",
  "When we come back from Helsinki, Finland, Sebastian Gorka, Sara Carter, and Daniel Hoffman all react to my interview with President Trump and today's summit between the president and Vladimir Putin as we continue, straight ahead.",
  "And despite this, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls -- oh, just before the election, it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with.",
  "Now that Trump is president, after nearly a decade of playing down Russian interference and its impact on our elections, the left is in total freak out mode, trying desperately to connect Russian hacking to the Trump presidency.",
  "HANNITY: Let's talk about specifics that you went over, as it relates to both Syria, which he has been a supporter of the Assad regime, and, of course, Iran, which is the number one state sponsor of terror, fomenting proxy wars.",
  "To me, the most important issue is the nuclear issue, because I know President Obama said that global warming is our biggest problem, and I would say that nuclear warming is our biggest problem by the factor of about 5 million.",
  "Instead, the president is now rightly pushing Germany to kill its oil and gas deals with Russia and get their energy from us in that the United States, which would also mean millions of high-paying career jobs for Americans.",
  "As we all know, there are a lot of serious issues between the U.S. and Russia, but predictably, even before this meeting took place, yes, the destroy Trump, hate Trump media, they were already, hoping and predicting failure.",
  "I'm not asking if you did, but I know you did, and if you continue to do it I'm going to make--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Why do you think he didn't do that, what didn't -- well, although in frank discussion I think he did it.",

  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Once again, President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia in the American elections.",
  "And yet, Angela Merkel wants to import billions of dollars' worth of their energy, up to 70 percent, which I would argue, that would make them vulnerable and --\n\nTRUMP: She's paying Russia billions of dollars.",
  "And by the way, the same Barack Obama that tried to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu through election interference as if this doesn't happen everywhere every day as Brennan and Paul has said.",
  "I think it's becoming a humanitarian situation, and a lot of people are going to move back to Syria from Turkey and from Jordan and from different places, they're going to move back, less so from Europe.",
  "I raised $44 billion and the secretary general said he raised $44 billion and it's only President Trump, because I said, otherwise, we are going to have to start thinking about our relationship to NATO.",
  "However, under President Trump, any hostile or aggressive action by Putin's regime will be and should be met with strength, not appeasement, not bribery, not cash, not kissing the rings of dictators.",
  "No more cargo planes full of cash, and as President Trump frequently says, a good relationship with Putin and Russia, when you're not trying to bribe them, it is very positive thing for the country.",
  "Nobody in the media seems to care about Obama's attempt at interference in the last Israeli election against our number one ally in the Middle East, Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

  "John Brennan who is accusing the president being a traitor voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War in 1976 when the Soviet union actually wanted to destroy America.",
  "HANNITY: And if there was Russian interference, Hillary played through a law firm, a investigative group Fusion GPS, the hired a foreign national--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: That's right.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nHANNITY: In the lead up to the summit, you actually tweeted out if you were given the greatest city of Moscow for retribution for all the sins, et cetera, Russia.",
  "You know, they do business with -- it's good for a lot of the countries that do business with Iran, but it's not good for this country and it's ultimately not good for the world.",
  "TRUMP: Well, he thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win, he didn't want to do anything to disturb it, and you know, frankly, when I won, he said this is the biggest deal.",
  "As president, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease artisan critics or the media or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct.",
  "So, I was amazed that most of most of the media -- you didn't and some others didn't -- but most of the media said that I was tough, very tough, and nasty to foreign leaders.",
  "And while the mainstream media and left, as they peddle their conspiracy theories, well, the administration is now putting forth some truth and some precedent and some facts.",
  "The inflation is rampant and going through the roof, and not that you want to hurt anybody, but that regime, we will let the people know that we are behind them 100 percent.",
  "ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: You have been watching the most disgraceful performances by an American president at a summit in front of a Russian leader joint that I have ever seen.",
  "So, I figured I'd wake up the next day and read these wonderful stories, and by the way, I got along great --\n\nHANNITY: Do you really believe the media would report that?",
  "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Look, Sean, let me -- let me address the question of how everybody is reacting to the press who were on the left.",
  "And rightly tough on Peter Strzok, who frankly, every FBI I know feels that he has hurt the institution that they love and have served either in the past or presently.",
  "And instead of saying that I raise $44 billion, not million, $44 billion last year for NATO, I raised -- it could be over $150 billion this year and into the future.",
  "And we also know, you can go way back to 2008, we know that Russia hacked into both the McCain campaign and even the presidential campaign of Barack Obama himself.",
  "President Trump is just not slowing down, and some people in the media, on the left, they are having a very hard time dealing with the fact that he moved so fast.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nHANNITY: When we come back, we'll continue from Helsinki with much more of my one-on-one interview with President Trump as \"Hannity\" continues.",
  "I will say that I was amazed at the media because honestly, I was there for a day and a half, and it started right when I got there, and I was very respectful.",
  "If they were physical missiles, like during the Cuban missile crisis, Americans would be in the streets and protesting, and asking the president to protect us.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections.",

  "HOFFMAN: I mean, I spent a good part of my life collecting intelligence on Vladimir Putin, so let me just take a look at it from his eyes, from the Kremlin.",

  "As we continue from Helsinki in Finland, and this is part two of my interview with President Trump, moments after his press conference with Vladimir Putin.",
  "Now, despite what the media predicted, there is real progress on the Korean peninsula, because the president's peace through strength strategy is working.",
  "After all, if the West is so worried about Russia, well, why would they be willing to give him billions and billions of dollars to make Russia rich again?",
  "Sara, I want to start with you, because the media and the left in this country is in the middle of what it can only be described as a collective meltdown.",
  "The idea that we have a chance to talk about big issues, saving hundreds of thousands of lives in Syria, the question of Ukraine's national sovereignty.",
  "And the idea that somehow that President Trump whose dropping $150 billion in cash and other currency--\n\nSARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely.",
  "This is something they won't report under his administration, the U.S. issued sanctions against roughly 200 individuals and entities related to Russia.",
  "When you look at NBC and some of the others, when you read \"The New York Times,\" it's just a story after story after story that's just a negative spin.",
  "We discussed so many different things, including nuclear, including war and peace, including economic, Syria, Ukraine, we discussed many, many things.",
  "HENRY: The president was bold on the world stage and was willing to call out an ally, Angela Merkel, and say you are in bed with the Russians on that.",

  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: As we continue from Helsinki, Finland, we continue with Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Ed Henry, Sara Carter, and Daniel Hoffman.",

  "I did like the idea and I thought this was interesting that the president is saying, Putin had a good idea, let Mueller's people go interview them.",
  "Take a look at this despicable cartoon, yes, published by so-called paper of record, The New York Times Opinion Page on Twitter early this morning.",
  "The president has never been afraid to walk away from a bad deal, never been afraid to call out foreign leaders, and hold all of them accountable.",
  "Now, Putin should be very concerned about that possibility, as it would literally destroy Russia's economy and probably destroy him politically.",
  "And there was this mystery answer that I think surprised a lot of people by the president of Russia, as it relates to the Mueller investigation.",
  "From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility.",

  "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, NBC: I just don't see how we can expect anything to come out of this and why Donald Trump is forcing the issue so much.",
  "I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server.",
  "Every single report, every investigation into our election shows absolutely no votes were changed, none were altered in the 2016 election.",
  "And as far as I know Donald Trump never voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War, so let's just put that on the record.",
  "And the United States has been busy arming Ukraine with lethal weapon systems, but the media, they are not going to focus on any of this.",
  "It happened in a way, it happened as this everybody in Congress has now said it happened before and it's probably going to happen again.",
  "We're talking about Syria and humanitarian aid, we're talking about all these different things, and we get questions on the witch hunt.",
  "(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: What was not bold--\n\nHENRY: But then why would -- why was he not bold enough to also stand up to Vladimir Putin?",
  "Your mainstream media just blind hatred for President Trump and they long predetermined that anything the president does is terrible.",
  "Now, following his talks with Vladimir Putin, I had the opportunity to sit down with the president right after his press conference.",
  "HANNITY: And America pays 70 cents of every dollar, and a lot of people have not lived up to their commitment as it relates to that.",
  "You know, many years ago, when I was there, it was '13, quite a long time ago, he said there were many, many business people there.",
  "HANNITY: The president, Dr. Gorka, was very clear in saying this has been the biggest, the biggest wedge between the two countries.",
  "You saw the unveiling of the deep state last week with Strzok's testimony, today you really saw the depth of the mainstream media.",
  "2021, the START Treaty needs to be extended, and also the INF as it relates to -- and he did bring up the idea of missile defense.",
  "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Now, big leaders, they also addressed the big elephant in the room, and that was election interference.",
  "Ninety percent of the nuclear power in the world between these two nations, and we've had a phony witch hunt deal drive us apart.",
  "And at some point we got to say where are -- where is this evidence as well because we want to know who knew what when and where.",
  "And let me just finish real quick with my thought which is--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: What does that do to our future relations?",
  "I said if I got Moscow as part of a deal, they'd say, here's Moscow, please pardon us, the soccer ball was really very nice.",
  "Now, on this show, we are not afraid to report that what the mainstream media will not report and we have been proven right.",
  "And at the end of this meeting, I think we really came to a lot of good conclusions, a really good conclusion for Israel.",
  "DANIEL HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the concern--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: It's like you're very thoughtful, Dan.",
  "TRUMP: I heard that she did much better than he did, and took a lot of hard shots, but at least she was honest about it.",
  "Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything.",
  "UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CBS: This does not seem like a president who is really going there to really hold Putin accountable.",
  "There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.",
  "In 2014, in \"The Washington times,\" Devin Nunes said with certainty that Russia would try to impact the 2016 elections.",
  "TRUMP: You have to understand, you take a look, you look at all these people, I mean, some were hackers, some of them.",
  "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy.",
  "And at the end of a long period of time, I mean, it was really a long -- it was just the two of us, and interpreters.",
  "So I'm going to embarrass you in the world, we'll never talk again not about nuclear proliferation, Syria, with Iran.",
  "HANNITY: And of course, this pit bull Andrew Weissmann who I think has a pretty atrocious record that we have found.",
  "You see, success for Donald Trump is bad for their agenda, especially in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections.",
  "And Devin Nunes--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: I'm telling you, I think John Brennan and Barack Obama have a lot to answer.",
  "There's a lot of stuff that goes on where we collaborate and at the same time, they are targeting us aggressively.",
  "And the American people, our safety and security, frankly, is dependent on all of this -- our kids, our grandkids.",
  "And so, I think a lot of good things are happening, but President Putin is very much into making that all happen.",
  "HOFFFMAN: I think maybe he did i privately but I think it would have been good to hold him accountable publicly.",
  "They came out of the closet there is no journalism on the mainstream media left and it was absolutely shambolic.",
  "I do think that on Iran, he probably would have liked to keep the deal in place because that's good for Russia.",
  "He felt it was very hard for me to make a deal because of, you know, all of this nonsense and much of the case.",
  "And by the way, it's important to point out every major country in the world engages in election interference.",
  "In fact, if you're looking for Russian interference, look no further than Hillary Clinton and the DNC in 2016.",
  "But the more amazing thing, too, is we have more jobs available than we actually have people on unemployment.",
  "NATO is wonderful but it helps Europe a lot more than it helps us and yet we are paying for 90 percent of it.",
  "I'm talking about there is a big percentage of the media, when you look at CNN, how false their reports are.",
  "Let me ask you--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: The 13 angry Democrats do you think they want to go, I don't think so.",
  "And that's why I believe that if the president had said look, Vladimir, we know you meddled in the election.",
  "HANNITY: The guy that voted for a communist, a former communist is now became the CIA director under Obama.",

  "He wants to throw the United States off balance, and he wants to divide the United States with its allies.",
  "People are being brought out to the fore, so far that I know virtually none of it related to the campaign.",
  "But first, a lot to get to, so sit tight for our breaking news -- Helsinki addition -- opening monologue.",
  "Now, this move would not only benefit the United States, it would also absolutely wreck Russia's economy.",
  "And even the Democrats say that doesn't work\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Of course Lisa Page contradicted him.",
  "And after today's one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin, the two leaders held a joint press conference.",
  "I've got to be direct in saying in having Vladimir Putin there and just to his face saying knock it off.",
  "Even in his private discussions with then FBI director Jim Comey, he said I want you to look into this.",
  "And also, interestingly, because a big part of NATO's mission is to prevent any hostility from Russia.",
  "And, you know, if you look at Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons.",
  "But when you see this thing going on, and I will tell you, it's driven a wedge between us and Russia.",
  "The safety of nuclear power, which is ultimately, there is nothing bigger and nothing more important.",
  "He understood it and he was -- I don't know if you could see, he was incensed even talking about it.",
  "On top of that, the European Union takes total advantage of us with tariffs and with trade barriers.",
  "But they are having big protests all over the country, probably as big as they have ever had before.",
  "And earlier today, President Trump, he went face to face with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.",
  "And we need to counter the stuff that they're doing to us--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: I agree with you.",
  "And you know, it's very interesting, you look at what's happening, and you look at the whole thing.",
  "HANNITY: Can you partner with Russia to perhaps stop the fomenting of terror, stop the proxy wars?",
  "One nuclear site in fact has been dismantled and shuttered, and the process continues to this day.",
  "And when it came to reductions--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: And did everybody around him did anything.",
  "This is one thing that everybody needs to be aware of and how at home again and again and again.",
  "You may not alter or remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from copies of the content.",
  "Really, a lot of people would say, he has put himself at the forefront of the world as a leader.",
  "And they are going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign.",
  "And if you look at what is happening, is falling apart, they have rights in all their cities.",
  "I mean, she is going to do it, but it's a little tough when you are in NATO and you do that.",
  "And --\n\nTRUMP: Well, when I say enemy of the people, I'm not talking about all of the media.",
  "Basically, he said to Angela Merkel, you're a fool for becoming energy dependence on Russia.",
  "HANNITY: -- to talk to on a variety of issues the two biggest nuclear powers is a bad thing.",
  "HANNITY: Devin Nunes--\n\nHENRY: But Donald Trump today had a chance to say enough is enough.",
  "He is really concerned about election meddling--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Everyone should be.",
  "With regard to the reaction to today's summit, it's a little bit like the Strzok testimony.",
  "Where is our cybersecurity that prevents anybody from being able to do something like that?",
  "HANNITY: A lot of people in the lead up to this -- obviously, you met with our NATO allies.",
  "HANNITY: You literally just finished the press conference with President Putin moments ago.",
  "HANNITY: For --\n\nTRUMP: Last year, they $44 billion more only because -- more, additional.",

  "It is 9:00 p.m. in New York City and our nation's capital, 6:00 p.m. on the West Coast.",
  "Starting with John Brennan calling this summit treasonous, Nancy Pelosi and Jeff Flake.",
  "Because had President Trump not won the election, we would have no none of this, Sean.",
  "I sat down for an interview with the president right after he met with Vladimir Putin.",
  "In all fairness, I was a very successful businessman but I was one of a lot of people.",
  "Which by the way, Putin confirmed today he didn't have such information on his peril.",
  "That was Vladimir Putin earlier today denying Russia interfered in the 2016 election.",
  "If there were--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Well, there was collusion -- let's be honest.",
  "But we discussed ISIS and the threat of ISIS, and basically the threat of terrorism.",
  "You talked about Vladimir Putin as a foe and you clarified that means a competitor.",

  "Going back in the Second World War we collaborated against Nazi Germany.",
  "Now, the years of weak and feckless leadership under Obama are now over.",
  "And specifically, Russia must stop coordinating with the Iranian regime.",
  "You know, it's been going on for many years, but we are doing very well.",
  "The media would be asking, why you didn't get to St. Petersburg as well?",
  "Because it was Comey and it was McCabe, but it was also probably Obama.",
  "Like North Korea, you are very clear in saying that this is a process.",
  "The nuclear problem, we have to make sure, we have to be very careful.",
  "Instead, it's Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion.",
