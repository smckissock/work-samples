  "High return growth plus cash returns\n\nOil giant Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) tumbled 23.5% last year -- one of the worst performances among big oil stocks -- despite making excellent progress on its plan to adjust its business so it can thrive at lower oil prices.",
  "The recipe for a rebound\n\nNatural gas pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) declined 13% last year even though it completed its turnaround plan, and distributable cash flow (DCF) -- the excess cash it can use to pay dividends -- held roughly steady.",
  "Given that crude is currently well over $50 a barrel, Anadarko is on pace to generate significant free cash flow; it noted in late November that it could produce more than $700 million in free cash this year based on where prices were at the time.",
  "In fact, at $50 a barrel oil, the company says it would generate enough cash flow to fuel $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion in capital investments, which in turn would allow it to increase its oil output by 14% versus 2017.",
  "If that happens, it will lift a huge weight of uncertainty that has been holding down Kinder Morgan's valuation, since Trans Mountain represents a substantial portion of the company's growth prospects.",
  "First, Kinder Morgan expects to boost its dividend 60% this year, which would push its yield up to 4.4%, making it more attractive to income investors.",
  "Oil prices rebounded sharply in the second half, with WTI crude rising by about 11% to end 2017 at more than $60 a barrel, a two-and-a-half year high.",
  "Shares currently trade at a rock-bottom price of 8.8 times 2018 DCF, which is well below the average 14.9 times DCF multiple of its peer group.",
  "That would give the company even more money to return to investors on top of the $2.5 billion share buyback program it announced in September.",
  "However, the company recently won a crucial court battle, which increases the odds that it will be able start construction this year.",
  "That sizable buyback, when combined with its growing free cash, could fuel a rebound in the company's stock price this year.",
  "Because of that, 2018 could be a bounce-back year for the sector, especially if crude oil prices continue heading higher.",
  "For example, the company has increased its margin per barrel by 34% while significantly improving its balance sheet.",
  "In addition, it plans to repurchase up to $500 million of its stock, which could also help drive the price higher.",
  "Finally, the company could begin construction on its controversial Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion in Canada.",
  "That said, even if they don't, these three energy stocks could still enjoy big years.",
  "Investors had worried that local opposition might stymie the project.",
  "That might have been expected to fuel big gains for energy stocks.",
  "These moves put Anadarko in position for a strong year in 2018.",
  "That discount could narrow in 2018 thanks to several catalysts.",

  "Last year was an odd one for the energy sector.",
  "Instead, most of them lost value last year.",
