  "This form of light touch, case-by-case adjudication pursuant to a standard is in contrast to more draconian prohibitions, under which Facebook would end up as a “regulated utility.”\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Ethan Zuckerman explains that users “need the right to opt out of this bargain, paying for services like Facebook or YouTube in exchange for verifiable assurances that our usage isn’t being tracked and that our behavioral data is not being sold.” Then Zuckerman seizes on the pollution analogy: “We need to treat personally identifiable information less like a resource to be exploited and more like toxic waste, which must be carefully managed, as Maciej Ceglowski has proposed.",
  "If I could write the legislation, I would begin with some form of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”), in which consumers will “gain the right to access data companies store about them, the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to limit the use of decisions made by algorithms.” While preventing the sale of Facebook data to third parties such as Cambridge for targeting without explicit user consent, GDPR-style protections won't prevent abuse of subscriber-usage information entirely because they still allow first-party use of data.",
  "In the interim, Congress should let Facebook know that, in the aftermath of L’Cambridge Affaire, they are going to be expecting Zuckerberg to voluntarily commit to not accept political or issue advertising/sponsored content in this election cycle; not work with any campaign or political action committee; never again enable any bulk subscriber data to leak outside Facebook’s IT ecosystem; and include in the testimony Facebook’s plan and timeline for stopping rampant data exploitation of its customers on a permanent basis.",
  "This is similar to Roose’s “automatic ‘self-cleaning’ option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store.”\n\nA realistic short-term solution\n\nRather than shaming Zuckerberg, Congress should convene a hearing of true experts—in social media, economics, regulation, online advertising, and fake news—to solicit opinions on how to craft a new regulatory and privacy regime.",
  "In response to L’Affaire Cambridge, The Economist called for an independent tribunal called the “Data Rights Board” to regulate Facebook and other platforms, tasked with setting and enforcing “the rules by which accredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening users’ privacy.” The Data Rights Board also would serve as a “referee of complaints” from end users, awarding injunctive or monetary relief where justified.",
  "To wit: Facebook could be forced to port its users to a new service called “Facebook Basic”—a service that is free from advertising for at least three years; after that, a user could prepay a small fee to continue service, allowing her account to disappear if he or she doesn’t renew; if the user wants to keep the fancier bells and whistles, including curated content, he or she would have to accept ads and use of data.",
  "Aside from the schadenfreude of humiliating Facebook’s youthful CEO for two hours on live television, a Senate hearing with social media executives is equally ineffective as antitrust at solving the “Facebook Problem”—namely, the rampant exploitation of user data by third parties to generate online scams and dezinformatsiya (Kremlin-orchestrated disinformation campaigns), among other pollutants of the public square.",
  "Facebook’s unwillingness to police how third parties exploit its data—and its willingness to work with third parties to provide access to the universe of friend profiles without “releasing” the data (in the case of Cambridge), or to track who clicks on ads and to targeting others whom its algorithm thinks are likely to buy (in the case of online scam artists)—throws the Facebook Problem into sharp relief.",
  "Ferguson argues that Facebook should be treated under the law “more like a content publisher than a technology company.” In particular, Ferguson would amend the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to “increase [Facebook’s] liability and make them more accountable for damaging information trafficked on their platforms.”\n\nThese are all thoughtful solutions that warrant further study and cost-benefit analysis.",
  "As an extra layer of protection, I would add a “Know Your Customer” requirement for all advertising-driven websites, similar to those used for foreign wireless providers and U.S. banks, to prevent one person with twenty aliases indiscriminately spreading lies across the Internet and to confirm human (as opposed to bot-driven) audience size for ad buyers and trend watchers.",
  "Facebook’s hegemony with respect to our social order is so pervasive that an intentionally false post, gone viral, can affect a company stock price or prompt a suicide; a well-run disinformation campaign can even alter the course of history (think Brexit or Trump), warping popular will and thereby subverting the democratic process.",
  "In the New York Times, Kevin Roose argues that Facebook’s private network should be converted into a decentralized, “social federation” made up of a “cluster of independent nodes.”\n\nFor the same reason we don’t use antitrust to address toxic waste or other pollutants, we shouldn’t use antitrust to solve the Facebook Problem.",
  "This may require a digital EPA, as Franklin Foer, Paul Ford, and others have argued—a prospect that would be more appealing if the actual EPA wasn’t currently being gutted.”\n\nIn a Washington Post interview, the Hoover Institute’s Niall Ferguson offers a different regulatory fix for the Facebook Problem.",
  "Thus, any talk of market-based solutions or “self-regulation,” as ridiculously suggested by Senator Schumer in his Recode interview, reveals at best an intentional naivety regarding Facebook’s business model, or political corruption at worst—Schumer’s daughter is a privacy manager at Facebook.",
  "Facebook’s large social footprint induces some sharp minds, including writers on this very page and in the Guardian, to conclude that the source of the Facebook Problem (and the remedy) lies with Facebook’s monopoly control over the paid messages its massive audience sees.",
  "Elementary microeconomic textbooks suggest, however, that a monopolist is (perhaps counter-intuitively) preferred to competition when the underlying industry is characterized by negative externalities, as higher prices lead to less output and thus less pollution.",
  "Notably, none of the solutions reviewed below involve the Federal Trade Commission, which is perennially short-staffed, libertarian-leaning, and falling ever farther behind its EU counterpart on understanding the con games and the societal dangers lurking online.",
  "The Cambridge Analytica affair (“L’Affaire Cambridge”), which brought the Facebook Problem to the forefront, exposed the dark arts of Facebook in particular and the shady underworld where Internet advertising and politics intersect.",
  "Instead, Facebook’s ad-supported social network model incentivizes behaviors that are harmful to society, including Internet scams, fake news, and pernicious exploitation of user data by unscrupulous mercenaries like Cambridge.",
  "Facebook’s platform, which includes Facebook’s site, those of affiliates like Instagram and WhatsApp, and third-party sites via its Audience Network service, dominates the supply of online advertising, along with Google.",
  "Uber’s entry sent cab incomes (and the value of medallions) plummeting, but it also reduced the price of fares via enhanced competition, allowing Uber to dodge a recent antitrust claim brought by Philadelphia taxis.",
  "Put differently, adopting GDPR-style protections in the United States, while a healthy improvement over the status quo, will not prevent Facebook from exploiting its users’ data for targeting for its own purposes.",
  "Thus, in addition to the opt-in privacy protections, I would layer on some version of the “Digital EPA/Data Rights Board/Net Tribunal” to regulate the dealings between third parties and dominant tech platforms.",
  "A supplier of a popular tracking software told Faux that his customers place $400 million worth of ads a year on Facebook and an additional $1.3 billion elsewhere; these budgets for online scams are malleable.",
  "This comparison is not meant to suggest that Catalist and Cambridge operated according to the same scruples; it merely highlights the exploitation of Facebook user data on both sides of the political aisle.",
  "Decentralizing the enterprise, as suggested by Roose, doesn’t solve the need to chase advertising revenue to keep the business running—even a social federation has to fund growth and storage and speed.",
  "Fortunately, antitrust is but one type regulation\n\nSo if the Facebook Problem defies antitrust because it does not directly entail inflated prices for its users or suppressed output, what can be done?",
  "And Facebook doesn’t even charge a price to consumers who join the network, effectively immunizing much of its conduct from antitrust liability under the narrowly defined consumer-welfare standard.",
  "Facebook can’t be expected to voluntarily forgo profit opportunities to solve a social problem any more than a coal factory should voluntarily limit its production to reduce its carbon footprint.",
  "(Economists typically confront pollution with taxes, so as to ensure that the price reflects not only the private costs but also the social costs; query how such a tax would work here.)",
  "(Even where Facebook threatens edge innovation by appropriating the functionality of independent apps, antitrust isn’t the right remedy because it moves too damn slowly.)",
  "As with other dominant tech platforms such as Uber and Amazon, Facebook inflicts certain costs on society that aren’t readily policed (or “cognizable”) under antitrust.",
  "(Wolfie Christl, author of Networks of Control, has a nice thread that explains how Facebook lets businesses link customer data with Facebook data with here and here.)",
  "In the aptly titled “How Facebook Helps Shady Advertisers Pollute the Internet,” Zeke Faux uncovers the sordid arrangements between these affiliates and Facebook.",
  "As the unscrupulous Cambridge is to Republicans and foreign autocrats, Democrats had their own data exploitation firm, Catalist, working for the Obama campaigns.",
  "Facebook’s advertising monopoly is foul, but it’s not clear whether five equal-sized social networks (the “Baby FBs”) would produce any less online pollution.",
  "Applied here, it’s not clear whether Facebook’s power to dictate online ad rates exacerbates (or mitigates) the extent of pollution thrown off its network.",
  "Thus, a monopoly coal supplier comes closer to producing the socially optimal level of coal than does a set of competitive coal suppliers.",
  "And when it comes to online scams, advertising affiliate networks are the polluters and Facebook is their distributor and sales partner.",
  "Because media-buying compensation is based on the size of buy, there is no incentive for advertising agencies to stop the scams.",
  "Given our dysfunctional Congress and likely court challenges under the First Amendment, however, this quick fix is unrealistic.",
  "Fortunately, several analysts, including your fearless blogger right here, have offered regulatory fixes outside of antitrust.",
  "Well, it’s more like a private waterway that is tolerant of polluters, or a private dump that turns a blind eye to batteries.",
  "Thus, while cleaning up the toxic Facebook river is a good start, fixing just Facebook moves the online pollution elsewhere.",
  "Amazon’s entry similarly inflicted pain on local bookstores (among other retailers), but it also reduced the price of books.",
  "Facebook, Google, and others likely will work around any strong privacy regulations to lock in their advantages and profit.",
  "Zuckerberg’s company may not create fake news, but its business model perversely encourages this form of online pollution.",
  "But advertisers are not sympathetic antitrust plaintiffs, and high ad rates are not really what bothers us about Facebook.",
  "Importantly, the more of these harmful pollutants sloshing around Facebook’s networks, the higher is Facebook’s profit.",
  "But can any of the unseemly conduct uncovered by the latest Facebook scandal be fixed with the hammer of antitrust?",
  "Prohibiting such pursuits is the job of regulators, not private enterprises with primary duties to shareholders.",
  "In a well-functioning legislative branch, the best ideas would become law before the November elections.",
  "The problem is bigger than just Facebook\n\nNo analogy is perfect, but a polluted river works well here.",
  "The online scams (and their fake-news cousins) will just find the next best option to using Facebook.",
  "The short answers are no, no, and beefed-up privacy protections plus a new cop on the Internet beat.",
  "This answers our second question: The Facebook Problem is much larger than just Facebook.",
  "And all of the proposals recognize that the problem is bigger than just Facebook.",
  "When it comes to fake news, Cambridge Analytica plays the role of the polluter.",
  "And if not antitrust, then what other forms of regulation would do the trick?",
  "Anything short of this prescription is political theater by both parties.",
  "#DeleteFacebook, switch to Instagram, then spin off Instagram!",
  "This stinks for advertisers that fund the enterprises.",
  "The whole damn ad-dependent Internet is polluted.",
  "The last one has nothing to do with antitrust.",
  "“Break up Facebook!” shout the protesters.",
  "Facebook undoubtedly has too much power.",
  "Is the problem truly Facebook-specific?",
  "When every problem looks like a nail .",
  "No economist would cheer for monopoly.",
  "There are more radical interventions.",
  "Facebook is not the polluter per se.",
