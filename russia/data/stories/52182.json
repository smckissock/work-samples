  "This information shines a light on how easy it is for people to build trust with unverified individuals.”\n\nIn one sentence, the story mentions Podesta: “Former Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta infamously fell victim to such a trap, though the person who preyed on him had more nefarious intentions than mockery.”\n\nWhile the spear-phishing cases in Tapper’s report had White House officials and Trump family members responding – and one official even provided his private email address – no one seems to have been asked to provide access to or change email passwords.",
  "The breach is included in CNN’s online library overview of incidents tied to accusations that the “Russian government meddled in the election.”\n\nA CNN article last month states as fact that Russia “hacked” Podesta’s email: “The Russian hack of Podesta’s emails played a pivotal role in the election, as WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of his emails one day at a time during last year’s presidential campaign.”\n\nIronically, a CNN story showing how a simple spear-phishing effort breached Podesta’s Gmail account claims in the headline that Russia was behind the breach.",
  "“And through a comedy of errors, I guess, he instructed her to go ahead and click on it and she did.”\n\nPodesta’s main error, according to the CNN report, which cited Podesta himself, was that the campaign’s IT worker replied that the spear-phishing email asking for a password change was “legitimate” when the worker meant to reply that the email was “illegitimate.”\n\nThe CNN story says the Russian “hacking” began in earnest when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) discovered in April 2016 that its computers had been breached.",

  "In the case spotlighted by Tapper, an individual described as an “email prankster” in the UK was able to fool Trump administration officials, demonstrating the simplicity of such a feat and showing how virtually anyone with creativity and knowhow could have been behind the breach of Podesta’s email account reportedly via a general spear-phishing campaign.",
  "These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier.”\n\nComey’s statement about a “highly respected private company” gaining access to the DNC servers was a reference to CrowdStrike, the third-party company ultimately relied upon by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the DNC.",

  "That CNN story relates:\n\nThe email that would help Democrats lose the 2016 presidential election arrived on March 19, 2016, signed — seemingly harmlessly — “Best, the Gmail team.” The email was sent to John Podesta, the then-chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.",
