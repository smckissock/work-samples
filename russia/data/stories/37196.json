  "Democratic activist Scott Dworkin, co-founder of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the \"largest anti-Trump group in the world,\" was relentlessly mocked on Twitter Thursday after his suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was behind the American Health Care Act, or \"Trumpcare,\" because he wanted to \"kill as many Americans as possible.\"",
  "Then, in February, Trump's former national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, resigned after it was discovered he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.",
  "Doctors and hospitals also have been hesitant to get on board with the plan, citing some of these same reasons — that it would reportedly kick millions of Americans off their health insurance plans.",
  "Hours later, critics took to Twitter to mock the baseless claim:\n\nRepublicans introduced the American Health Care Act on Monday as a replacement plan for Obamacare.",
  "The accusation came as rumors continue to swirl about whether President Donald Trump's campaign worked with Russian officials to influence the Nov. 8 election.",
  "Some critics of what is now being dubbed \"Trumpcare,\" though, have said the plan would result in millions of people losing their health insurance.",
  "And a new report Thursday revealed what CNN reported as an \"odd\" computer link between the Russian bank Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization.",
  "U.S. intelligence agencies and at least two congressional committees are investigating claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.",
  "The Congressional Budget Office, which examines the financial impacts of legislation, has not yet released its analysis of the bill.",
  "Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, resigned in August after it was reported he once worked as a pro-Russian lobbyist.",
  "\"If u were Putin & wanted to kill as many Americans as possible — wouldn't taking away their healthcare do the trick?",
  "But the lack of evidence isn't stopping some Democrats from jumping to some outrageous conclusions.",
  "even suggested that Obamacare might actually be better than the Republicans' plan.",
  "So far, there is no evidence to back accusations of collusion.",
  "Dworkin sent the incendiary tweet at 10:17 a.m. Thursday.",
  "#trumprussia #russiagate,\" Dworkin tweeted.",
  "Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)"
