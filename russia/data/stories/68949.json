  "Harley-Davidson vrooms to Europe\n\nWith help from Brianna Gurciullo and Daniel Lippman\n\nFALLOUT: Harley-Davidson announced Monday that it’ll be shifting some production of its world-famous motorcycles overseas to avoid new tariffs the European Union has imposed on U.S. exports — tariffs that were themselves levied as retaliation against new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
  "The company said it would start making motorcycles for the European market at facilities outside the U.S. since “the EU retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent would mean a motorbike shipped from the U.S to Europe would now face a tariff of 31 percent, up from 6 percent, leading to an average cost increase of $2,200 per motorcycle,” reports POLITICO Europe's Jakob Hanke.",

  "“If the U.K. leaves the EU without an aviation agreement, flights would immediately cease between the islands and the EU27 since EU-issued operating aviation licenses would no longer be valid, and British airlines would no longer have the right to fly to EU countries,” Saim reports.",
  "“I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car / Don't go so fast, but I go pretty far / For somebody who don't drive, I've been all around the world / Some people say I've done all right for a girl.”\n\nLISTEN HERE: Follow MT’s playlist on Spotify.",
