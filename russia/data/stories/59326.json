  "GOHMERT: Being a former felony state judge --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: Yes --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: If I had somebody like you come before me and now it was --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: I'm not the --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: -- and find later the guy that signed and approved an application for a warrant had not even read the application that would allow spying on somebody --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: That would be atrocious --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: I would look at everything he signed from then on with a jaundiced eye.",
  "COLLINS: Could he have passed the polygraph -- in the context of the text we see now, before and continuing in sensitive areas such as the investigation, the Mueller investigation, again, the Hillary Clinton -- but knowing the things we've commented on today, if those texts taken into could were on this polygraph and it -- would he or could he have passed a polygraph if he'd, you know, of his own ability denying an affair with Lisa Page?",
  "WRAY: We did, as I think the White House has reported and disclosed, we did have a meeting not just with the FBI but with deputy attorney general, with the Homeland Security secretary, I think Director Coates may have been there, the attorney general maybe also, where the whole focus was on making sure that we are doing what we should be doing --\n\n\n\nSWALWELL: Was the president --\n\n\n\nWRAY: Collectively.",
  "I hope I have the opportunity to explain --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: Let me --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: I understand --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: You look at the deputy -- look at the summary, the -- Mr. Horowitz said we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to prioritize Russia investigation while we're following up on the mid- year related investigations led -- discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.",
  "GOHMERT: Mr. Chairman, since we're learned that he relies heavily on people in his team to do these applications, I don't think we can get to the truth until we question Tasheen Gaahar and Trisha Anderson, and that would include why she slow walks the notices of NSC meetings to the attorney general when she's working for the DAG just to make him look bad.",
  "Meantime before that, we were just listening in to that hearing that has been a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill today involving the FBI Director Christopher Wray, you see, as well as Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, grilled by Republicans on all things from media leaks to the Russia investigation to the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.",
  "We need to get those two people in here --\n\n\n\nGOWDY: The gentleman's time has expired --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: If there's any evidence of wrongdoing, sir, by anyone on my staff or anyone in the department, I would expect you to give them fair process bringing the information to my attention or the inspector general's attention.",
  "REP. JERROLD NADLER, (D), RANKING MEMBER, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Earlier, I referenced a January 27th, 2000, letter to John Lynder, then the chairman of the rules committee -- of the subcommittee on rules and organization of the House committee on rules from the then- deputy assistant attorney general Robert Rayburn.",
  "SWALWELL: Do you find it, Director Wray, unhelpful that the president would tweet in the manner that he did this morning and the public comments he's made where he doesn't acknowledge that Russia interfered in our election, yet you are tasked with trying to counter Russian interference in our election?",
  "Did you not know that Bruce Orr was meeting with Christopher Steele, getting the information about the dossier, and supplying information to the FBI at the same time at the same time his wife was working for Fusion GPS that was helping Hillary Clinton -- did you not know he was doing that for the FBI?",
  "WRAY: I don't remember the exact words in the meeting, but the gist was to make sure that we're doing, all of us, not just the FBI, but all parts of the government that have responsibility for protecting our country against foreign influence that we're all doing what we should be doing.",
  "When we explored it, he admitted that those biases that Mr. Strzok had -- not just Mr. Strzok but the others listed that have been referred for discipline, probably indirectly affected not only the information the decision-makers had, but the decisions that were made.",
  "Page 149, what you'll find -- and this is one thing the inspector general testified, as well, is that the -- he did not find documentary testimony evidence that improper considerations including political bias directly affected the specific investigative decisions.",
  "So, what's been characterized today is that the finding of the inspector general is that there was none of the bias that has brought Mr. Strzok into such -- under a microscope so closely, affected the decisions made in the Hillary Rodham Clinton investigation.",
  "Some of the reports that came from that meeting is that there was a sense of an unwillingness to cooperate, collaborate with tech companies to make sure they are aware of efforts undertaken by foreign entities or to otherwise interfere in elections.",
  "And this is the problem that this committee saw in the previous attorney general, the previous FBI director, and the previous, you know, previous two attorney generals to be honest in this, in which things were done out of order, out of sequence.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Mr. Chairman, if there were any conflicts of interest that were brought to our attention, I would discuss it with Mr. Mueller, and there could be review in the department if there were credible allegation of a conflict of interest.",
  "SWALWELL: In your experience at the department, are you aware ever in your experience with the department's history of an unindicted subject of investigation being given evidence that exists in the case where that person's a subject?",
  "I want to make the request that we work in partnership with the tech companies to do everything we can to ensure that every American's vote is counted fairly, and every American has confidence in their vote and the ultimate election.",
  "I want to ask, are you aware of Mr. Strzok setting up a June 9th meeting at Trump Tower where the president's son, son-in-law, and campaign chairman, met with individuals seeking to offer dirt from the Russians on Hillary Clinton?",
  "WRAY: Congressman, I'm not going to --\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I didn't speak to him about it, but he'll be in particular happy about one of those victories, do you know which one we're talking about?",
  "SWALWELL: And do you intend to change that with the request that Rudy Giuliani, the president's counsel, has made that unindicted information would be given over to the president as it relates to the Russia investigation?",
  "[14:10:00] WRAY: As I indicated, I think the intelligence community's assessment which I agree with is that Russia attempted to sow discord in our country in an effort to influence the last election.",
  "And the inspector general found that he had opinions that were distasteful, especially toward our president, candidate Trump, but there was no finding that that influenced the investigation.",
  "We're working closely with them in appropriate ways to try to list in ways that are appropriate their assistance in trying to better protect the country from improper maligned influence.",
  "But I wrote in my letter dated yesterday the history and the explanation of why it is wrong for the department of justice to publicly identify people who are subjects of investigations.",
  "On January 13th, 2016, an individual from the FBI's Washington field office e-mailed Mr. Strzok and other employees that their polygraphs were out of -- I think it was out of scope.",
  "We're curious what vetting has gone in, the inspector general found -- inspector general found there was one person on the investigative team that he found to have untoward bias.",
  "[14:25:00] WRAY: I will say, congressman, this is the first time I've heard any complaints about what information we're providing again under the efforts we're providing.",
  "I don't discuss my conversations with the president other than to say I have not received any improper order from the president to do something that I believe was wrong.",
  "COLLINS: OK. Is there -- an office of legal counsel opinion that informs the department in this area, and if so, are you directing Special Counsel Mueller to follow it?",
  "From our perspective, we're looking to see what they come back to us with as again in a joint, coordinated effort to protect -- they have to protect their own platform.",
  "Would the topic of the extramarital affair have come up in the polygraph, or possibility come up in the polygraph with Mr. Strzok that could have put it out of scope?",
  "You're watching some live comments now from the president speaking in Wisconsin as he visits the new Foxconn manufacturing plant that's going to be developed there.",
  "I want to ask was your deputy, I'm sorry, Trisha Anderson involved in any stage of drafting, editing, or approving the four FISA applications to spy on Carter Page?",
  "September 2, 2016, Lisa Page wrote a letter to Mr. Strzok saying that she had talking points for Director Comey because POTUS wants to know everything were doing --",
  "SWALWELL: And did Mr. Strzok ask candidate Trump or write a speech for candidate Trump in the summer of 2016 to invite the Russians to do further hacking?",
  "I have talked with Mr. Mueller on several occasions about the importance of making sure the people on his team --\n\n\n\nBIGGS: I don't want to cut you off.",
  "SWALWELL: And Mr. Wray, has President Trump personally told you to use your resources at the FBI to counter future election meddling by the Russians?",
  "As the deputy attorney general mentioned, there's also now an indictment through the special counsel's office that speaks to much the same subject.",
  "My own experience including going to Silicon Valley and meeting with the companies, we're doing things that were not done before the 2016 election.",
  "You have to understand in context, sir, that the department had made the decision to disclose the FISA to the house and senate before I got there.",
  "The inspector general testified that Peter Strzok led the investigations both for the e-mail investigation and the initial Russian investigation.",
  "A hearing involving the FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testifying before the House judiciary committee.",
  "The concern I have is process inside the Department of Justice when you have someone of his counterintelligence level, this is not a new recruit.",
  "There's a report that there was a meeting last month in Silicon Valley between eight tech companies and the representatives of the DOJ and FBI.",
  "You and I had a conversation about this a few months ago, this was Mr. Strzok's issue, I asked at the time did he have his security clearance.",
  "GOHMERT: So just to be clear, apparently Director Wray, you have to answer for the deputy attorney general about FISA applications he signed?",
  "[14:00:00] REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, (R), TEXAS: Subordinates which are all employees of the department of justice, aren't you vouching for those?",
  "And I, too, share your belief that he acted inappropriately, and we shouldn't allow opinions to get in the way of law enforcement duties.",
  "Has your agency provided to these companies what they need to make sure they are able to put up the defenses and respond to any threats?",
  "SWALWELL: Would you agree that in 2016 Russia electronically through weaponizing social media and hacking emails attacked our democracy?",
  "Now, my question about this would be -- you didn't know about the polygraph at the time, we'll assume now that it is out there, you do.",
  "Our administration is very committed to backing the blue and protecting law enforcement officers from any kind of abuse or retaliation.",
  "I want to make it clear to the deputy attorney general you will be afforded a full opportunity to respond once his time has expired.",
  "GOHMERT: And that would include when Bruce Orr's office was directly next to yours I believe, is not correct and he worked for you?",
  "Just a few -- I think one of the interesting things, this is amazing how this, the last few minutes, we went from making crap up.",
  "Meeting with the former president on the tarmac, not disclosing it -- these were things that led to distrust as we go forward.",
  "I would encourage you not to jump to conclusion that's I or anybody else did anything wrong until we have all the information.",
  "\n\n\n\nReturn to Transcripts main page\n\nCNN NEWSROOM\n\nReport: Contentious Hearing Between GOP Lawmakers and Rosenstein And Wray.",
  "In this particular result, the intelligence community information was declassified, so I'm uncomfortable talking about that.",
  "WRAY: I think that's a shorthand for what was in the intelligence community assessment which I have every reason to accept.",
  "And then there are review processes within the FBI and department, and ultimately the decision is made by a federal judge.",
  "SWALWELL: Has Mr. Trump contacted you either personally, by phone or in writing, with respect to the Russia investigation?",
  "SWALWELL: This morning, Mr. Wray, the president tweeted, \"Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling.\"",
  "Exactly how it was structured and who supervised whom, that probably subject to more context and explanation by others.",
  "Terry was thinking about doing this --\n\n\n\nBRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Clearly a busy news hour here in the CNN newsroom.",
  "SWALWELL: I've read the inspector general's report about Mr. Strzok, and I've heard how he's been characterized today.",
  "SWALWELL: OK. Did he personally, though, express if he wanted the FBI to devote resources to counter Russian meddling?",
  "GOHMERT: So, he officed a couple of doors down, but you had no idea that he was the go between to get the information.",
  "When you approve a FISA application, in your mind, does that mean you should read it and understand what's part of it?",
  "It's on me for not having briefed the attorney general on all the great new things the FBI is doing on that subject.",
  "I'm telling you, I was concerned --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: If you give me a chance to explain, sir --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: You have.",
  "Mr. Rosenstein, the scope letter, who wrote the scope letter for Mr. Mueller's -- the scope of his duties would be?",
  "GOHMERT: I didn't ask that question because you've said you approved it, but you took out the words that you read.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: You should certainly understand what's part of it, sir, as I said --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: You're parsing words.",
  "This morning Donald Trump, our president, tweeted -- when is Bob Mueller going to list his conflicts of interest.",
  "I assure you, sir, I'll be just as offended as you if I find there was incorrect information in the application.",
  "We're going to continue to follow both of these live events and continue our special coverage when we come back.",
  "Is there in your opinion a constitutional standard that guides your department in investigating any president?",
  "I'd be reluctant to publicly name people who aren't on the front lines just because of what that might invite.",
  "I'm not in position to comment on the details, and I don't recall whether it's a constitutional issue or not.",
  "I've had the chance to meet with the clerks of the two counties I represent to understand what they're doing.",
  "That's a mischaracterization because under questioning -- let's go there -- you probably have the book there.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I wouldn't want to comment on what's ever happened, but generally that would not be our practice.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I approved the filing --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: You say you approved that application --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: Yes.",
  "I guess the second thing I would say you referenced the attorney general's earlier testimony on the subject.",
  "So, let's go to -- I sent you a letter -- I don't know if you got it because it's just a couple of days old.",
  "It's a very thorough process, and in a particular case, four different federal judges found probable cause.",
  "We're aware of some of the events that took place before your confirmation as the deputy attorney general.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Congressman, I appreciate that question because I understand why there's confusion about this.",
  "WRAY: Doing a number of things to brief committees and members of Congress on all the things we're doing.",
  "If he wants to yield --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: My time continued to run while the chairman took up some of my time.",
  "I hope you pass along my thanks to the men and women who serve the Department of Justice and the bureau.",
  "I think what's important to understand -- I understand the FISA process is very obscure to most people.",
  "BIGGS: OK.\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: We do not identify persons as is disclosed in the portion that's made public.",
  "His bias did -- his bias did affect that decision --\n\n\n\nGOWDY: The time of the gentleman has expired.",
  "Let me ask you about this -- you said earlier Bruce Orr was not working on the Russia investigation.",
  "Do you believe that Russia had something to do with the meddling that occurred in the last election?",
  "WRAY: Congressman, there are a lot of opinions out there about a lot of things including on Twitter.",
  "And so, are you inclined to release that, or is this something you and I need to talk about offline?",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Sir, when I took this job, I committed that I was going to read every letter personally.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Sir, in my capacity as deputy attorney general, I do have meetings with the president.",
  "I want to thank Paul Ryan, I want to thank our great congressman, Glenn Grothman -- where's Glenn?",
  "But I hope that the letter will speak for itself and explain why it is our policy not to do that.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I have not, congressman, commented on anything about who may or may not be indicted.",
  "Congressman, sitting here now, I don't know who was involved in drafting what FISA application.",
  "SWALWELL: Mr. Wray, you agree that the FBI's responsibility is to prevent attacks on America.",
  "WRAY: I have no idea what would have been raised in any specific's polygraph at this moment.",
  "WRAY: Congressman, I think I'm going to let the inspector general's report speak for itself.",
  "What I signed was a renewal application, approved three different times by a federal judge.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: He worked in the deputy attorney general's office, a couple of doors down, yes.",
  "REP. TREY GOWDY, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The gentleman from Texas will suspend.",
  "CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: I wasn't sure if you were directing that question to me.",
  "And that's on me for not having at the time, he has now gotten more extensively briefed.",
  "That's the commitment I made to the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, when I took the job.",
  "And I recognized it's confusing because people have departed from the rules in the past.",
  "I think it was a question to me when I testified in front of the committee in December.",
  "Let me try to clarify if I may --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: Did you sign the fourth FISA application?",
  "Everyone who served past and present on Mr. Mueller's special counsel investigation.",
  "A federal agent has to swear under oath that everything in the application is true.",
  "I think it's fair to say that Mr. Strzok played a lead role in both investigations.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I'm not aware of any provision in the constitution that addresses that.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: You're referring to the issue of whether the president can be indicted?",
  "BIGGS: And have you turned an unredacted copy over to any congressional committee?",
  "You were asking about --\n\n\n\nGOHMERT: The four applications to spy on Carter Page.",
  "And there can be mistakes, and we'll find out if there are mistakes in this one.",
  "These can be without commenting on an ongoing investigation at all of any kind.",
  "GOWDY: The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, is recognized for five minutes.",
  "ANDY BIGGS, (R), ARIZONA: Thank you, thank you very much for being here today.",
  "It was signed under oath by an FBI agent who attested it was true and correct.",
  "I think you've been vague on whether you signed --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: No, no, sir.",
  "ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: Those people ultimately report to me.",
  "Let's allow the process to conclude before we jump to conclusions about that.",
  "The inspector general will review it, and I'll await those conclusions, sir.",
  "Aired 2-2:30p ET\n\nAired June 28, 2018 - 14:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.",
  "The chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Biggs for five minutes.",
  "WRAY: There have been a number of meetings with companies in Silicon Valley.",
  "SWALWELL: What would you do if the president did give you an improper order?",
  "GOWDY: The chair recognizes the gentleman from California for five minutes.",
  "GOHMERT: Now, that's going --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: Before -- that's my job, sir.",
  "BIGGS: The testimony, not his --\n\n\n\nWRAY: I wasn't here when he testified.",
  "[14:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Welcome back to the CNN newsroom.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I don't know exactly who wrote it, but I'm responsible for it.",
  "I know neither of you were there, but do you think that might be accurate?",
  "So that leads me to a series of questions related to what's going on here.",
  "A possibility of indictment or not indictment of that, of the president?",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I'm not aware of any request that Mr. Giuliani's made to me.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: As I said, sir, the inspector general's reviewing the FISAs.",
  "GOHMERT: -- you would approve it --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: I did approve it.",
  "COLLINS: That's fine and that's why you're here answering questions.",
  "This is somebody who's been around, who's had sensitive information.",
  "And I asked if he had been polygraphed, you didn't know at the time.",
  "SCHNEIDER: SI want to correct the record, between DHS and the FBI.",
  "[14:05:00] If he finds some problem with that, we'll respect that.",
  "And this FISA process is being reviewed by the inspector general.",
  "June 25th, asking if you were going to provide us with the names.",
  "But we'll get back to that maybe off line or something like that.",
  "We're following -- BIGGS: Talking specifically the scope letter.",
  "Mr. Rosenstein, does Mr. Mueller have any conflicts of interest?",
  "And one of the problems goes back, though, before you got there.",
  "We're more focused on trying to make sure we get our work done.",
  "And we move into the last investigation, ongoing investigation.",
  "COLLINS: In the sense of how these investigations are handled.",
  "REP. ERIC SWALWELL, (D), CALIFORNIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "GOWDY: Without objection, it will be made part of the record.",
  "It's not a matter of just slapping a document and signing it.",
  "I was taking the words that the deputy attorney general said.",
  "I certainly completely understand why you asked the question.",
  "So, I'm not aware of any disqualifying conflict of interest.",
  "All the speculation that you read has nothing to do with me.",
  "We're continuing to follow the hearing on capitol hill now.",
  "However, some of your team members certainly were involved.",
  "Not by you, obviously, but by people who are ill motivated.",
  "We don't identify persons publicly unless they're charged.",
  "THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.",
  "I'd like unanimous consent to insert this into the record?",
  "Did he set that up, or was he involved in that in any way?",
  "If there's more we could be doing, that we're doing that.",
  "REP. DOUG COLLINS, (R), GEORGIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "COLLINS: OK.\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: I haven't read them recently.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I do not know the answer --\n\n\n\nCOLLINS: Wray.",
  "Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Wray, thank you for your service.",
  "These were reports, so I don't want to make any claims.",
  "[14:15:00] COLLINS: It goes to the indictment, as well.",
  "The country's counting you as we go into the midterms.",
  "We're providing them information to help them do that.",
  "REP. BRAD SCHNEIDER, (D), ILLINOIS: I appreciate that.",
  "As I said, there are a lot of things that we're doing.",
  "WRAY: That's one of many of our responsibilities, yes.",
  "GOWDY: The gentleman from New York seeks recognition.",
  "Let me ask you --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: Not to my knowledge.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I wouldn't follow an improper order, sir.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I know there are two historical opinions.",
  "You said you would check, it appears that he had it.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: I have no personal knowledge about that.",
  "BIGGS: It was -- I didn't expect you to be watching.",
  "But these are essentially search warrant affidavits.",
  "Let's hear both sides and then reach the conclusion.",
  "It doesn't mean you need to read it in your opinion.",
  "It appears the security clearance has been revoked.",
  "Would you agree with his characterization of that?",
  "I just have a few questions, specific questions.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Is there a constitutional standard?",
  "If you go to page 211 I think it is, let's see.",
  "[applause] And we have so many other officials.",
  "GOHMERT: And actually, I was being interrupted.",
  "And we only have two minutes and seven seconds.",
  "GOHMERT: That's your job, OK. You approved it.",
  "You've said --\n\n\n\nROSENSTEIN: No, I have not.",
  "The American people are counting on you both.",
  "That's been a lot of conversations we've had.",
  "But I think you raised an important question.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: It depends on the circumstances.",
  "I thought you were asking me questions, sir.",
  "If he was wrong, we'll hold him accountable.",
  "But I have to thank a man who I gave it to.",
  "People have deviated from that in the past.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: To avoid -- it's not practical.",
  "Terry and I have had a great relationship.",
  "Was that part of any finding that you had?",
  "The president chaired the meeting, so yes.",
  "We've worked to make them more effective.",
  "And my commitment is to follow the rules.",
  "I probably have seen them at some point.",
  "It's illegal for us to talk about FISAs.",
  "The deputy attorney general may respond.",
  "The gentleman from Texas will suspend.",
  "I completely understand that question.",
  "BIGGS: You signed off on it probably?",
  "I completely understand your concern.",
  "Has there been discussion about that?",
  "But it's an interesting process here.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
  "It said the polygraph raised flags.",
  "It does go to that issue, as well.",
  "Most people couldn't have done it.",
  "Don't those people respond to you?",
  "And we explain that in the letter.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Not as far as I know.",
  "When did you find out about that?",
  "He ran for 2,000 yards that game.",
  "I appreciate that with the both.",
  "Do you think there is or is not?",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Not to my knowledge.",
  "GOHMERT: A couple of doors down.",
  "GOHMERT: You did not know that?",
  "Our folks really aren't either.",
  "I haven't been able to do that.",
  "Like handing the football off.",
  "Are you aware of the meeting?",
  "I don't think that's far off.",
  "I'm not really a Twitter guy.",
  "A president or any president?",
  "GOWDY: You'll have that, too.",
  "GOHMERT: To your knowledge.",
  "Pretty clear to most of us.",
  "SCHNEIDER: I appreciate it.",
  "BIGGS: OK. And why is that?",
  "We'll review it obviously.",
  "We don't talk about FISAs.",
  "I did not have a question.",
  "NADLER: I thank you, sir.",
  "But I have not read them.",
  "With that, I yield back.",
  "Would that be accurate?",
  "I asked you about that.",
  "As riveting as it was.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Yes, sir.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Correct.",
  "Thank you very much.",
  "SWALWELL: Thank you.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Correct.",
  "ROSENSTEIN: Correct.",
