  "Animal Circus's Joel Fry: Multiple episodes, Seasons 4 - 5\n\nAnimal Circus may be a relatively new band, but the bouncy, alt-pop combo has a readymade fanbase thanks to the membership of Joel Fry, the actor who played the recurring role of Hizdahr zo Loraq — a scion of the formerly slave-holding aristocracy of Mereen and, briefly, the betrothed of Daenerys Targaryen.",
  "Michiel Huisman: Multiple episodes, Seasons 4 - 6\n\nThe funky, Dutch pop band Fontane may not have been a household name, but it gave frontman Michiel Huisman some experience onstage before taking over the role of sellsword Daario Naharis from fellow actor Ed Skrein in Season Four.",
  "HBO\n\nDr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson: Multiple episodes, Seasons 1 - 2\n\nWilko Johnson, guitarist of the legendary pub-rock band Dr. Feelgood, was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, which interrupted his role of the executioner Ser Illyn Payne, the man known for removing Ned Stark's head.",

  "Winnet's Thomas Brodie-Sangster: Multiple episodes, Seasons 3 - 4\n\nAside from this turn as the adorable moppet in Love Actually, Brodie-Sangster is probably best known to Thrones fans as Jojen Reed, Bran Stark's confidante and the brother of Meera.",
  "Coldplay's Will Champion: \"The Rains of Castamere,\" Season 3\n\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" is a folk ditty that's threaded throughout Game of Thrones; the National even provides a version for the soundtrack of Season Two's \"Blackwater\" episode.",

  "HBO\n\nMolotov Jukebox's Natalia Tena: Multiple episodes, Seasons 1 - 3 and 6\n\nHer fame already established by her role in the Harry Potter series, Natalia Tena played an edgier role as Osha, a wildling who winds up loyal to House Stark.",
  "Raleigh Ritchie: Multiple episodes, Seasons 3 - 6\n\nJacob Anderson plays the Unsullied soldier Grey Worm with such stiff-upper-lipped stoicism, it's hard to imagine him existing outside of Game of Thrones, let alone cutting loose.",
