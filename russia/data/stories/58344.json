  "The only time, and you're the first person in the media that I'm saying this very directly to -- I said, ‘Hello,’ to him in passing, handed him my business card and never got a business card from him, as I did for many ambassadors in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention.”\n\nPage said the reason he never mentioned the passing encounter before was “out of respect for privacy for Ambassador Kislyak.",
  "I was going as a private citizen.”\n\nThe oft-quoted line from the speech that was characterized as anti-American was, \"Washington and other western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”\n\nBut Page told Fox News the line was taken out of context to make him look bad.",
  "While in Moscow, he gives a speech critical of the United States and other western countries for what he believes is a hypocritical focus on democratization and efforts to fight corruption.”\n\nWhile Trump campaign “people were okay with [the trip],” Page said, “the word 'approved' … can be misleading that I was actually authorized to go and represent the campaign.",
  "He would stay with the Trump team until September 2016, but says he left because “these stories kept coming out based on the dodgy dossier.”\n\nPage appeared in the infamous “Trump Dossier” created by former British Intelligence operative Christopher Steele, working for a U.S. political research group called Fusion GPS on behalf of both Republicans and Democrats.",
  "Then, according to Schiff, “Just prior to the convention, the Republican Party platform is changed, removing a section that supports the provision of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, an action that would be contrary to Russian interests.”\n\nBut Page told Herridge in the exclusive interview, “I was always very cautious.",
  "In his opening statement before testimony by FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers last week, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., put Page at the center of an alleged web of collusion to help Russia interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",
  "In no way, shape or form.”\n\nStill, Page acknowledged for the first time what he insists was a brief meeting with the Russian ambassador at the Republican National Convention – an admission sure to fuel foes of the Trump administration looking for evidence of Trump-Russia coordination.",
  "“It was really about that concept of mutual respect and the way various countries including Russia, China and the United States, can work together for having a more constructive relationship primarily with the states of central Asia, such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan,” he said.",
  "Schiff, at the hearing, pointed to another allegation from the dossier, that “Page also had a secret meeting with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, reported to be a former KGB agent and close friend of Russian President Putin.”\n\n“I have never met Igor Sechin in my life,” Page countered.",
  "As he prepares for interviews with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, Page gave a categorical denial when asked by Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge whether he worked with the Russians to help the Trump campaign.",
  "EXCLUSIVE: Former Trump adviser Carter Page, in a wide-ranging interview with Fox News, decried what he described as “propaganda” driven by a “false narrative” regarding his 2016 contacts with Russian officials, denying that he ever worked with them to help the campaign.",
  "Just like everything else about those allegations.”\n\nFor his part, Page argued that the attacks on the Trump administration by its political foes have harmed the U.S. political system more severely than the allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election.",
  "“All of the discussions about the influence that the Russian government had on the U.S. election would actually pale in comparison to the much heavier influence that the U.S. government actually had in trying to hurt then-candidate Trump.",
  "I had no direct one-on-one material discussions with him in any way, shape or form.”\n\nPage even denied the dossier allegation that Manafort appointed him as a coordinator with the Russians: “Totally false.",
  "I may have seen him at a conference once at a distance, but I've never shaken his hand.”\n\nAfter his Moscow speech, Page attended the Republican National Convention last July in Cleveland.",
  "“I did nothing that could even possibly be viewed as helping them in any way.”\n\nAsked whether he had worked with the Russians to hurt the Clinton campaign, he replied, “Absolutely not.",
  "“And so out of respect and out of doing what's best for the campaign, I thought it's best if I step aside and take a leave of absence at that at that point,” Page said.",
  "Steele and Schiff described how Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak met with Page – acting as a go-between on behalf of then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
  "And there were very direct rules that that was an off-the-record session.”\n\nStill, Page asserted that, “Nothing happened between me and Ambassador Kislyak.",
  "“Liars and leakers in Washington and more broadly the political class in the United States actually had a much more negative impact,” Page said.",
  "Naval Academy midshipman, was a relative unknown when the Trump campaign announced his hiring as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016.",
  "Page is one of several Trump associates being scrutinized amid multiple probes looking at Russia's interference in last year's campaign.",
  "Schiff went through a blow-by-blow of Page’s alleged pro-Russian activities, which Page answered in his exclusive interview.",
  "That negative impact based on these complete lies has continued to put a dark shadow over the United States in general.”",
  "“In early July,” Schiff said at the hearing, “Carter Page travels to Moscow on a trip approved by the Trump campaign.",
  "Page, who described himself as an oil industry consultant and U.S.",
  "It had nothing to do with the campaign.",
  "I've never met him in my entire life.",
  "“Absolutely not,” he said, laughing.",
  "That I can assure you.",
  "“Completely false."
