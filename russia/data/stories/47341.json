  "Vote Leave’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings, declined an interview request, but on his blog, he wrote that the whistleblowers had “promised Watergate and delivered a dodgy Zoo­lander.”\n\nHe wrote, “Vote Leave’s donations were legal, the Electoral Commission gave us written permission, the whistleblowers are provably lying, we leave in a year and this lame gossip won’t even be a historical footnote.”\n\nJohnson, the foreign secretary, called accusations of illegal coordination “utterly ludicrous.”\n\n“Vote Leave won fair and square — and legally,” Johnson tweeted.",
  "Labour lawmaker Ben Bradshaw said that when he began raising concerns about the Brexit vote, he was considered a “crank.” But now, he said, almost all of his allegations have “proven to be correct.”\n\nHe said, “It’s not about who won or lost the referendum; it’s about the integrity and security of our democracy and our electoral system.”\n\nBradshaw added that it was “disgraceful” that May’s political secretary had outed Sanni as gay.",

  "In the closing days of the 2016 Brexit campaign, Sanni and his friend Darren Grimes zoomed from being unpaid part-time volunteers for the main “Vote Leave” organization, fronted by Tories Johnson and Michael Gove, to becoming leaders of their own allied group, called “BeLeave.”\n\nSanni and Grimes were both 22, and this was their first political campaign.",
  "“But I think we were used.”\n\nAlthough British law bans coordination between campaigns, Sanni said he and Grimes were based in the Vote Leave headquarters; were advised by Vote Leave staffers, including May’s now-senior adviser; and relied on Vote Leave’s attorney, who helped them incorporate the BeLeave group.",

  "“The only thing that’s actually going to trigger that referendum is MPs in Parliament feeling that the deal is a disaster and that public opinion is beginning to shift.”\n\nHe said claims that the Brexit vote may have been won through fraud were probably overstating the case.",
