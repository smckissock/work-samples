  "The fourth quarter has historically not been a particularly busy period for missile tests for the North, according to Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon.",
  "But the possibility of North Korea doing something to tarnish the Olympics cannot be ruled out since the regime has shown a history of disregard for international norms, including resorting to assassinations and kidnappings.",
  "The Pentagon official said the missile was launched from Sain Ni, North Korea, and traveled about 1,000 kilometers (or 621 miles) before splashing down in the Sea of Japan, within Japan's so-called exclusive economic zone.",
  "\"The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America, our territories or our allies.\"",
  "Indeed, Kazianis said there's every expectation that the first quarter will produce \"a heavy testing cycle\" as has been the case with Pyongyang's ballistic missile program.",
  "There have been concerns that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be tempted to make a provocation ahead of or during the South Korean event.",
  "Kazianis said there are a lot of contributing factors for why the hermit regime doesn't do as many tests in the final quarter of the year.",
  "President Donald Trump was briefed while the missile was still in the air, according to Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary.",
  "He said the North \"has a ton of new technology,\" including long-range ballistic missiles and \"new types of heat-shield technology.\"",
  "South Korean President Moon Jae-in has invited its neighbor to the North to participate in the games as part of a peace gesture.",
  "\"So I'm not shocked that they did this test but I'm a little surprised since I thought they would hold off until the Olympics.\"",
  "\"North Korea is just occupied doing other things, but they also have to continue proving their missile technology,\" he said.",
  "\"When we look at the data on the fourth quarter of most years they either test anywhere between zero and two,\" he said.",
  "\"We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment of the launch,\" said Manning.",
  "They include having the military assist in the fall harvest due to North Korea's chronic food shortages.",
  "South Korea is hoping tourism from the 2018 games will bring in substantial revenue for the country.",
  "Another report suggested the missile flew about 50 minutes and achieved an extremely high loft.",
  "According to Kazianis, the North has \"a lot of goodies that they will start rolling out.",
  "We're really at just the tip of the iceberg of seeing their capabilities, to be honest.\"",
  "South Korea's PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games are set to start in early February.",
  "Also, he said December is when the North tends to conduct more military drills.",
  "The testing is going to get more rigorous.",
  "This situation is going to get worse.",
  "\"Last year they did two tests.\""
