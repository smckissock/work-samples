  "It could also be the latest sign that prosecutors are tightening a ring around Stone, whom Democrats say has not been forthcoming about his 2016 contacts with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange; the website released thousands of Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign that proved highly damaging to Hillary Clinton.",
