  "Photo\n\nA federal bankruptcy judge in Delaware said on Wednesday that Caesars Entertainment, the troubled casino operator, could proceed with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy of its largest unit in its preferred jurisdiction of Chicago, handing an incremental but important victory to the company and its private equity backers.",
  "Although he did not elaborate in the ruling, the judge explained in court that allowing the case to move forward in Delaware would set a harmful precedent that creditors could upset a company’s reorganization plans, according to Reuters.",
  "The dueling bankruptcy plans for the unit, the Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, created an unusual spectacle that underscored the ferocity of the fight among some of Wall Street’s savviest players.",
  "These private equity firms had clashed with another group of Wall Street investors, including Oaktree Capital Management and Appaloosa Management, that own bonds with a relatively low priority ranking.",
  "Now, the private equity firms that control Caesars, Apollo Global Management and TPG, can try to carry out a restructuring plan to shed debt and salvage value from their money-losing investment.",
  "But legal experts say Chicago courts are known for a narrow interpretation of the bankruptcy code that could, in theory, protect the Caesars parent company and its affiliates from lawsuits.",
  "The ruling by Kevin Gross, a federal bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, Del., resolves a question over jurisdiction that had halted the bankruptcy before it could begin in earnest.",
  "The so-called junior bondholders had petitioned to force the Caesars unit into a bankruptcy in Delaware, apparently betting that they would have more legal advantages there.",
  "The junior bondholders had railed against the restructuring plan promoted by Caesars, under which they would be paid far less than the holders of first-lien bonds.",
  "Delaware courts, meanwhile, have a reputation for a more expansive interpretation of the code and for being friendlier to Wall Street investors.",
  "Lawyers for each side were essentially trying to situate the case in whichever arena they thought gave them the best chance of success.",
  "In his terse order on Wednesday, the judge cited “the interest of justice” in allowing the bankruptcy case to move forward in Chicago.",
  "These first-lien bondholders agreed to support the Caesars restructuring plan, though they are the only class of creditors to do so.",
  "He added that the so-called involuntary bankruptcy case filed by the junior bondholders would be moved to Chicago as well.",
  "Caesars has said it chose Chicago because a number of its casinos are in the Midwest."
