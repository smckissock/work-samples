  "Asked specifically about its partnerships with Chinese device manufacturers and how it ensured that no user data was downloaded to their servers, a company spokesperson offered a prepared statement that “given the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei's servers.”\n\nHowever, asked how Facebook had confirmed that no data was stored on its Chinese partners’ servers, the company stated that it had reviewed its API logs and found no suspicious accesses from those partners.",
  "Putting this all together, in the end, it seems little has changed in Facebook’s approach to user privacy and transparency in how it uses the data that its two billion members entrust it with, turning to contorted definitions to argue that third parties are actually extensions of itself, rather than third parties under the law, releasing the minimum possible information about how it shares user data with outsiders and failing to conduct the “trust but audit” investigations it has promised policymakers and a concerned public.",
  "For a company whose founder was hauled before Congress to testify about a privacy scandal involving the lack of control users have over their content and a lack of transparency about Facebook’s partnerships with external entities that have access to user data, it would seem that the company missed an obvious opportunity to educate lawmakers and the public about the full extent of access it provides to others of user data.",
  "Restricting access to users’ devices at least narrows the footprint of where user data is stored, yet the Times reports that Facebook confirmed that some of its partners did store user data, including the data of those users’ friends, on their own servers outside of Facebook’s control, but the company emphasized that it had legal agreements governing what the companies could do with all of that data.",
  "Given that Facebook allegedly had an agreement in place with Cambridge Analytica to delete its user data which was allegedly not fulfilled, it is unclear how Facebook verified that its device partners did not make any unauthorized use of the user data they stored on their own servers and most importantly how they secured that data from unauthorized access and breaches.",
  "Given the company’s contorted definitions of what constitutes itself versus its extension partners versus ordinary third parties, it is concerning that the company would not make a statement for the record that a user’s refusal to allow Facebook to conduct facial recognition on them extends to the myriad contractors and subcontractors that the company works with.",
  "Asked whether it had conducted any forensic audits of devices in the wild to confirm they were not transmitting user data back to the manufacturer’s servers in unauthorized ways or whether it had conducted audits of any kind of its device partners, the company confirmed that it had not, that it merely trusted that all partners adhered to its rules.",
  "It is worth noting that in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook’s response was that it had always simply trusted that when companies made promises to it about user data that they would honor those promises and that in the post-Cambridge Analytica world it needed to audit and verify companies that accessed user data in any way.",
  "Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Facebook had provided highly privileged access to the social network’s platform to more than 60 device makers to allow them to build their own “Facebook experiences” in the era prior to smartphone apps became popular and that this access continued at least in part through earlier this year.",
  "This recasting of external companies as extensions of Facebook rather than as third parties is a reminder of the myriad contractors and subcontractors that work for major Silicon Valley companies (and indeed all of Corporate America) and that require extensive access to sensitive private user data in the course of their business.",
  "The company’s argument is that since device makers are helping encourage users to engage with Facebook’s platform by offering the “Facebook experience,” they are extensions of itself, rather than third parties and thus the enhanced access did not violate its consent degree or contradict its other statements.",
  "Yet, casting device makers as extensions of the company is a concerning interpretation that essentially allows Facebook to make any company anywhere in the world part of itself for the purposes of complying with legal or policy requirements that select user data never leave the company’s hands.",
  "It would seem lawmakers should take such interpretations to heart as they craft future legislation, explicitly defining what constitutes a third party and codifying into law that any handoff of user data to an entity not directly owned by Facebook itself constitutes a third party transfer.",
  "In its public statements in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has repeatedly emphasized to lawmakers and the general public that it has heavily restricted third-party access to user data, cutting off the enhanced access available prior to 2015.",
  "Facebook declined to comment when asked whether it planned to add any security settings that would permit users to deny access to their data to all third parties, including those third parties that Facebook considered extensions of itself.",
  "Asked about facial recognition and whether the company’s security setting that allows users to request that Facebook not perform facial recognition on them extended to its third-party partners, the company also declined to comment.",
  "Again, the company argued that such sharing was not a violation of those security settings, since it considered BlackBerry to be an extension of itself for the purposes of providing a Facebook experience rather than a third party.",
  "When asked again how it had confirmed that its partners were not simply copying data from user devices back to their servers, which would not appear in its API logs, the spokesperson reiterated that it simply trusted its partners.",
  "The Times found that even after users set their privacy permissions to prohibit sharing of their data with third parties, Facebook permitted device makers to access that data, confirming the behavior on a BlackBerry Z10 device.",
  "Facebook also declined to comment on whether it would ever consider publishing a complete list of all companies, whether viewed as third parties or as partners or extensions of itself, that have ever held user data of any kind.",
  "For its two billion users, there is nothing for them to do but wait for the next Cambridge Analytica and the next round of apologies from Mark Zuckerberg assuring them there is nothing that could have been done.",
  "It also declined to comment on whether it would allow users to see the list of external partner companies that had accessed their data in any way in the process of providing a Facebook experience.",
  "It appears those statements were merely public relations assurances to calm a nervous public and stop action from policymakers, rather than guiding principles.",
  "In essence, if Facebook wants to share data with a third party it can simply define that company to be an extension of itself and voila, problem solved.",
  "While the company briefly acknowledged the existence of its partnerships program, it had provided little detail until the Times' report.",
  "Facebook pushed back on the report, arguing that the device makers were acting as extensions of itself, rather than as third parties.",
  "Making matters worse, one of those partners has been flagged by the US intelligence community as a national security threat.",
  "Yet, in reality, the company was still providing highly specialized API access to its device partners.",
  "What can we learn from this latest revelation about Facebook’s approach to user privacy and security?"
