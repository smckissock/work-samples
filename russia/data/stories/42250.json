  "Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant for records of \"inauthentic\" Facebook accounts\n\nIt's bad news for Russian election interference \"deniers\"\n\nMueller may be looking to charge specific foreign entities with a crime\n\nFBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly obtained a search warrant for records of the \"inauthentic\" accounts Facebook shut down earlier this month and the targeted ads these accounts purchased during the 2016 election.",
  "Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC earlier this month that he wants to know how sophisticated the Russian-bought ads were — in terms of their content and targets — to determine whether they had any help from the Trump campaign.",
  "It also means that Mueller is no longer looking at Russia's election interference from a strict counterintelligence standpoint — rather, he now believes he may be able to obtain enough evidence to charge specific foreign entities with a crime.",
  "Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, now a partner at Thompson Coburn LLP, said that the revelation Mueller obtained a search warrant for Facebook content \"may be the biggest news in the case since the Manafort raid.\"",
  "Legal experts say the revelation has enormous implications for the trajectory of Mueller's investigation into Russia's election interference, and whether Moscow had any help from President Donald Trump's campaign team.",
  "jared kushner More\n\nThe Facebook warrant \"means that Mueller has concluded that specific foreign individuals committed a crime by making a 'contribution' in connection with an election,\" Mariotti wrote on Saturday.",
  "\"It also means that he has evidence of that crime that convinced a federal magistrate judge of two things: first, that there was good reason to believe that the foreign individual committed the crime.",
  "\"The key here, though, is that Mueller clearly already has enough information on these accounts — and their link to a potential crime to justify forcing [Facebook] to give up the info,\" she said.",
  "Rangappa, now an associate dean at Yale Law School, explained that to obtain a search warrant a prosecutor needs to prove to a judge that there is reason to believe a crime has been committed.",
  "The bureau is reportedly investigating Manafort's financial history and overseas business dealings as part of its probe into possible collusion between the campaign and Moscow.",
  "If any Trump associate knew about the foreign contributions that Mueller's search warrant focused on and helped that effort in a tangible way, they could be charged.\"",
  "\"This is big news — and potentially bad news for the Russian election interference 'deniers,'\"said Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent.",
  "Congressional intelligence committees are homing in on the campaign's data operation as a potential trove of incriminating information.",
  "The FBI conducted a predawn July raid on the home of Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in late July.",
  "\"That means that he has uncovered a great deal of evidence through other avenues of Russian election interference.\"",
  "The warrant was first disclosed by theWall Street Journalon Friday night and the news was laterconfirmed by CNN.",
  "The prosecutor then has to show that the information being sought will provide evidence of that crime.",
  "Mueller would not have sought a warrant targeting Facebook as a company, Rangappa noted.",
  "Rather, he would have been interested in learning more about specific accounts.",
  "\"It is a crime to know that a crime is taking place and to help it succeed.",
  "That has implications for Trump and his associates, too, Mariotti said.",
  "For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android.",
  "Second, that evidence of the crime existed on Facebook.\"",
  "That's aiding and abetting."
