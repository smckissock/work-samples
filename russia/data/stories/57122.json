  "(RELATED: Here’s How Carter Page Ended Up On The Trump Campaign)\n\nPage has denied the allegation and called Steele’s report the “dodgy dossier.”\n\nPage was also a recipient of one of Papadopoulos’ email pitches seeking a meeting with Russians, but he told The Post that he did not recall the email.",
  "But one of the more intriguing revelations about Papadopoulos, an oil and gas consultant, is that he was reportedly in touch with the head of a U.S.-Russia trade group who is an alleged source for the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.",
  "Papadopoulos, a former researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank, would send several more emails to Clovis, campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski trying to set up similar meetings with Russian government officials.",
  "In the dossier, the source alleged to be Millian, a Belarusian who formerly worked in the Russian military as a translator, made a number of salacious claims about Trump and the campaign in conversations with intermediaries working for Steele, a former MI6 agent.",
  "(RELATED: The Source Of Salacious Claims In Trump Dossier Has Been Identified)\n\nIf Millian and Papadopoulos were in contact during the campaign, the connection raises the question: did Papadopoulos share campaign details with Millian?",

  "Surprisingly little is known about George Papadopoulos, a 30-something energy consultant who this week became the latest former Trump campaign adviser to emerge as a focal point in the ongoing Russia collusion saga.",

  "She added that, to her recollection, Papadopoulos made no attempts to set up meetings with Russian government officials, as he would begin to do just three days after joining Trump’s campaign.",
  "One former campaign official who has been interviewed recently by congressional committees investigating collusion told TheDC that investigators asked numerous questions about Papadopoulos.",
  "The source also allegedly told an intermediary that Trump campaign officials were in frequent contact with Russian operatives and that information was being exchanged between the two sides.",
  "Clovis, who is now chief scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also made the ultimate decision to bring Carter Page onto the campaign after being introduced by Lewandowski.",
  "“Source D,” who is described as a “close associate of Trump,” made the salacious and uncorroborated claim that the former real estate mogul hired prostitutes during a trip to Moscow.",
  "And the reported connection to Millian, the alleged dossier source, raises the possibility that Papadopoulos had provided information that ended up in that salacious document.",
  "Papadopoulos played a “small role” in the campaign, but had little impact on the campaign, said Ma, who ran a pro-Trump super PAC after the Carson campaign folded.",
  "“We thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO allies,” Clovis responded.",
  "In its article identifying Millian as a dossier source, The Post reported that Millian has told associates that he was in contact with Papadopoulos.",

  "He forwarded a May 4 email to Lewandowski and other Trump campaign officials from Ivan Timofeev, the chairman of RIAC.",
  "Timofeev also did not respond to a request aiming to find out if he knew Papadopoulos prior to their email exchange.",
  "Steele had been hired by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was working for an ally of Hillary Clinton’s.",
  "The campaign volunteer would send the same message to Manafort, who also replied by scuttling the proposal.",
  "The emails undercut the narrative that the Trump campaign was openly colluding with the Russian government.",
  "Or was the campaign volunteer making an entrepreneurial move to win favor with senior Trump team officials?",

  "Did Millian pass those details to one of Steele’s intermediaries?",
  "Was he trying to advance his own personal business interests?",
  "Was he attempting to infiltrate the Trump campaign?",
  "He did not respond to TheDC’s interview requests.",
  "TheDC has not been able to verify that claim.",
