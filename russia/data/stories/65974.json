  "Foreign policy adviser to the Trump presidential campaign Carter Page disputed the accuracy of parts of the dossier compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele in his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee last week, but his comments also appear to corroborate sections of the controversial document and raise new questions over his meetings in Russia.",
  "“And as someone working on investor relations for a CEO who is under sanctions, would it be advantageous for that head of investor relations to see those sanctions go away?”\n\nPage replied that sanctions are “outside of the scope” of Baranov’s responsibilities and that nothing he “said to me ever implied or asked for anything related to sanctions.",
