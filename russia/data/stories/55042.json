  "A general view of the Zueitina oil terminal is seen in Zueitina, west of Benghazi April 7, 2014.REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori\n\nBuyers are reluctant to take advantage of discounts on offer because they are unsure who exactly owns the oil being marketed by the eastern government, even though it is internationally recognized following an election last year, oil officials and insiders say.",

  "CAIRO/BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Libya’s official government, holed up in the east after being forced to flee the capital, is struggling to sell crude oil under a new system it has devised in an attempt to bypass a rival administration in Tripoli.",
  "Last year, the U.N. Security Council banned the sale of oil other than though the NOC in Tripoli after a group of rebels in the east loaded oil on to a tanker which was eventually stopped by the U.S. Navy off the Cyprus coast.",
  "While Thinni’s forces have recently made progress in some areas, the chaos has disrupted central bank cash flows from Tripoli to the east, which has curtailed imports and undermined support for the prime minister.",

  "A senior official in the new eastern state oil company said it would be “very difficult” to persuade buyers to pay into the new bank account and prove to them the company owns the oil.",
  "The United Nations has not yet commented on Thinni’s oil plans but has previously urged both sides to leave the central bank and state oil firm out of their struggle.",
  "Richard Cochrane, senior analyst, MENA, at consultancy IHS Country Risk, said Thinni might at best hope to sell small quantities via friendly countries such as Egypt.",
  "This has plunged the public finances into crisis as oil is the only source of funds for the budget, forcing the central bank to burn through its dollar reserves.",
  "Introducing a new payment system via another bank account could cripple the central bank, one of the last institutions still largely untouched by the fighting.",

  "The bank is paying public sector salaries, including those of the armed groups fighting on both sides.",
  "The Libyan dinar has lost a third of its value on the parallel market due to a shortage of dollars.",
  "Thinni’s government controls roughly half of Libya’s output of almost 600,000 barrels per day.",
