  "A source with details of the “dirty tricks campaign” said: “The idea was that people acting for Trump would discredit those who were pivotal in selling the deal, making it easier to pull out of it.”\n\nOperatives were told to contract prominent Iranian Americans and journalists who favored the Iran deal, including, according to the Guardian, reporters for the New York Times, MSNBC, the Atlantic, Haaretz, and Vox.",

  "The New Yorker reported that one source said the effort to get information on Rhodes and Kahl was part of Black Cube’s work for a “private sector client pursuing commercial interests related to sanctions on Iran.”\n\nRhodes told the Observer he was not aware of the campaign against him but was not surprised.",

  "They also tried to figure out whether Rhodes was one of the Obama staffers who backed National Security Adviser Susan Rice’s request to unmask the identities of Trump transition officials caught in foreign surveillance.",
  "The firm also said it has “no relation whatsoever with the Trump administration, to Trump aides, to anyone close to the administration, or to the Iran Nuclear deal” — so it made an exception to deny the Trump ties.",
  "The tactics Farrow describes seem fairly transparent, even though, given the firm’s prominence, they’ve probably worked in the past: Rhodes’s and Kahl’s wives were apparently contacted by Black Cube operatives.",
  "“I would say that digging up dirt on someone for carrying out their professional responsibilities in their positions as White House officials is a chillingly authoritarian thing to do,” he said.",
  "Trump promised Netanyahu that Iran would never have nuclear weapons and suggested that the Iranians thought they could “do what they want” since negotiating the nuclear deal in 2015.",

  "1/10 — Colin Kahl (@ColinKahl) May 7, 2018\n\nWhy would someone feel the need to do this to win a debate about the merits of the Iran Deal?",
