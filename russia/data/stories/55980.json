  "Sprawling white-collar investigations like Mueller's nearly always involve a panoply of witnesses whose cooperation helps build cases, subjects whose actions are of interest to agents and actual targets in jeopardy of criminal charges.",
  "\"If there is a bank robbery, the government's position is, 'I can't tell who's an accomplice, who's a co-conspirator — it could be the guard, it could be someone standing in the teller line, it could be a lookout,'\" Van Gelder said.",
  "\"Generally if they don't want to talk to you, you don't want to talk to them,\" said one lawyer with a client in the case, who — like others who talked to the AP — spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.",

  "A person who has been interviewed by the government recently described being afraid to open a lawyer's bill, saying, \"Even if you are a witness, every basic interview is costing thousands of dollars.\"",
  "Over the last nine months, scores of men and women — some powerful and moneyed, others obscure and struggling — have crossed paths with special counsel Robert Mueller's team of prosecutors.",
  "And even if defense attorneys asked for formal assurances that their clients won't face charges, there's generally not much anyone can do to force an answer from the government.",
  "Even witnesses without risk of criminal jeopardy are \"nonetheless at the mercy of the government\" and its judgment, said another lawyer with a client in the investigation.",
