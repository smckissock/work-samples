  "It is a clever ploy that cuts to the heart of what makes Silicon Valley a very pure example of capitalism: the fact that it screws over, or tries to automate into the digital ether, a vast proportion of the American work force, in order to enrich, artificially and enormously, a small proportion of investors and owners, whose companies are — more often than not — profoundly unprofitable.",
  "The effects of this bargain on all of us have been well documented — even if some of its political consequences, as with the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, are continually ramifying — but the lives of the people who work in the industry and have foisted it on us are less well known, and this is where Corey Pein’s “Live Work Work Work Die” attempts to fill in the picture.",
  "Many of the people he meets “had a mysterious ‘side project’ — a start-up in the making — that was inevitably too ill formed to talk about, or far too technically complicated to remember.” Pein realizes that most of these “tech bros” were “doomed to be desk jockeys for life, forever dreaming of their star turn as Job Creators.”",
  "The idea he comes up with is called “Laborize,” a company that would hire itself out to one organization to unionize a rival — it would, say, contract with Uber to unionize Lyft — and therefore ruin the competitive advantage that comes from denying health care, steady wages and other benefits of unionization.",
  "Soon into his tenure, Demotix was bought by Corbis, an online photography database, which proceeded to reassign photographers from war zones to “chase reality TV stars around red-carpet events”; not long after, Pein learned that Corbis also planned to lay off half of Demotix’s employees.",
  "Calling it the Hacker Condo, he notes that all four residents are “immigrants or the children of immigrants, and therefore accustomed to getting jerked around,” and that the foreign-born residents are on H-1B visas, an arrangement that requires them to stay employed.",
  "Instead he wanders around outside, telling us that it “looks like pretty much any other dismal suburban office park” and that “the real story hid behind the blackened windows of the squat office buildings.” The real story — digitizing, data mining, etc.",
  "Struggling to find an apartment in San Francisco’s stratospherically overheated rental market, Pein settles for an Airbnb in which he has to share a room with four people and, because of what appears to be its uncertain legal status, has only one key.",
  "Still, despite and perhaps a little because of its lackadaisical approach to its subject, “Live Work Work Work Die” manages to capture something essential about Silicon Valley that has eluded other authors.",
  "Image\n\nSo, in the spirit of gonzo journalism, he decides to high-tail it to the Bay Area to sell a start-up and document the horrors of his temporarily adopted home along the way.",
  "Pein, a staff writer for the caustic and essential little magazine The Baffler, is a former newspaper reporter, who experienced the depredations of tech “disruption” firsthand.",
  "In an emblematic passage, Pein visits the Googleplex in Mountain View, but doesn’t manage to get inside any of the buildings, which in my experience is not so hard to do.",
  "Nor does his exhaustive, scathing description of what Silicon Valley companies do make for a serious contribution to journalism about the tech industry.",
  "This is because Pein starts from the grimy underbelly of tech and never makes it out, which accurately reflects the experience of many tech workers.",
  "Thinking he was following the money, in 2012 he joined a Seattle-based “avant-garde online news service” called Demotix as its editor in chief.",
  "It probably doesn’t ruin the surprise to point out that Pein’s efforts are a failure: His start-up plans stall out.",
  "We rarely hear of the people who fail, or work uselessly and endlessly hard, without much in the way of reward.",
  "— turns out to be what is already widely available in reporting elsewhere, in any case uncited in Pein’s book.",
  "We only learn of those who make it big — Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.",
  "But the lure of making it big keeps everyone working insane hours.",
  "More than gonzo, an aura of laziness pervades the exercise."
