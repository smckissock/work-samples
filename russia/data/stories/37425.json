  "Mike Theiler/Reuters Schwarzman — if he ever did buy the Knickerbockers — would be joining an elite cadre of private equity veterans, including founders or senior executives at firms such as Bain Capital, Apollo Global Management, and Sun Capital, who have recently spent record amounts to invest in pro-basketball franchises.",

  "On top of that, \"you need one terrific franchise player.\"",
  "He's also grim about the work that it would entail.",
  "There's just one problem, Knicks faithful.",
