  "The new federal guidance could give school districts and state education agencies \"leverage to push the College Board and the ACT to either eliminate the voluntary survey when it's being given in a school,\" said Amelia Vance, director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-funded think tank, \"or take out any questions that would be considered sensitive in a particular state.\"",
  "\"I find all of this really troubling,\" said Marianne Stephens, the college counselor at Shorewood High School, a public school in Shoreline, Wash. After students there received mailings from a slew of leadership events, Ms. Stephens posted a \"Sham Alert\" on her school's website describing many student recognition programs as \"essentially well-packaged marketing schemes.\"",
  "\"The harm is that these children are being profiled, stereotyped, and their data profiles are being traded commercially for all sorts of uses — including attempts to manipulate them and their families,\" said Joel Reidenberg, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law who was one of the authors of a recent research report on the student data market.",
  "While many of those efforts are aimed at adults, the recruiting methods for some student recognition programs give a peek into the widespread and opaque world of data mining for millions of minors — and how students' profiles may be used to target them for educational and noneducational offers.",
  "The College Board, which oversees the survey given with the SAT test, describes its services as \"the largest, most effective admission search database in the U.S., connecting millions of test takers with colleges, universities and nonprofit educational organizations.\"",
  "Paul Weeks, ACT's senior vice president for client relations, said his organization allowed only colleges, universities and scholarship organizations to use its database, which includes details like students' family income, religious affiliation and test score range.",
  "Richard Rossi, executive director of the National Leadership Academies, the company behind the future scientists event, said the program accurately described itself as selective because it accepted only students with at least a 3.5 grade point average.",
  "\"It wasn't like I sought out filling in my information for the College Board to sell to other companies,\" said Adriana Bay, 19, a sophomore at Vanderbilt University this fall who was solicited by the future scientists event when she was in high school.",
  "But the handling of student surveys is receiving heightened scrutiny, particularly in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that siphoned off the data of Facebook users who took a personality questionnaire.",
  "Scholarships.com also has a subsidiary, American Student Marketing, that describes itself as the \"exclusive broker\" of the student data collected by Scholarships.com, offering it to marketers of student loans, credit cards and smartphones.",
  "In May, the Department of Education issued \"significant guidance\" that recommended that public schools make clearer to students and their parents that surveys with the SAT and the ACT, a separate college admissions exam, are optional.",
  "Months earlier, the teenagers had received letters, signed by a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, congratulating them on being nominated for \"a highly selective national program honoring academically superior high school students.\"",
  "— Three thousand high school students from across the United States recently trekked to a university sports arena here to attend an event with an impressive-sounding name: the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders.",
  "\"I felt excited to hear words from people who were successful in science to inspire me,\" said Sebastian Gonzalez, a high school junior interested in engineering who came to the event with his parents from Northern California.",
  "Students at the three-day Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders heard motivational career talks by science luminaries like Sylvia Earle, the renowned oceanographer, and Shree Bose, a Google science fair winner.",
  "Scholarships.com, for instance, asks students for their name, birth date, race, religion, home address and citizenship status and whether they have \"impairments\" like H.I.V., depression or a \"relative w/Alzheimer's.\"",
  "In a follow-up email, Mr. Goldberg said his organization \"was troubled\" by the inquiry from The New York Times and was suspending the university that shared students' data while it conducted an investigation.",
  "For high school students who want to receive materials from colleges and scholarship organizations, nonprofit college admissions testing services, like ACT and the College Board, offer optional surveys.",
  "More from The New York Times:\n\nYouTube is improperly collecting children's data, consumer groups say\n\nAmerican women are having fewer children than they'd like\n\nWhat does 'off the record' really mean?",
  "The organization has signed an industry Student Privacy Pledge, which includes a promise not to sell students' personal information or disclose it for unauthorized purposes or targeted advertising.",
  "They also face little oversight because federal education privacy laws make public schools, and not their vendors, directly responsible for controlling the spread of student data.",
  "In an email, Mr. Goldberg said the College Board would \"maintain a direct relationship with and oversight of all organizations using College Board-sourced student data.\"",
  "More than three million students who graduated in 2018 took surveys with the ACT, the SAT or the PSAT, which is a college scholarship test given to high school juniors.",
  "But many of them were selected for the event because they had once filled out surveys that they believed would help them learn about colleges and college scholarships.",
  "On Monday, the College Board said it was changing its policy regarding universities and colleges that share its student survey data with certain educational partners.",
  "Mr. Rossi said he had also developed a new recruitment method: hiring the parents of past program attendees to solicit student recommendations from teachers.",
  "Parents also have the right to opt their children out of any school-required surveys that touch on sensitive topics like religion, family income or politics.",
  "But the College Board allows universities to share students' data with certain educational partners, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board.",
  "But critics say survey services may categorize students in ways that could expose them to predatory marketing or exclude them from important opportunities.",
  "As marketing materials on the ACT site put it: Purchasing the names of \"racial and ethnic minorities is a great way to increase diversity at your campus.\"",
  "In filling out those surveys, the teenagers ended up signing away personal details that were later sold and shared with the future scientists event.",
  "Last week, ACT acquired the company that owns MyCollegeOptions, one of the services that shared information with the future science leaders event.",
  "Mr. Rossi, the National Leadership Academies' executive director, said his company planned to be more transparent about how it selected students.",
  "The laws generally prohibit online educational vendors to schools from selling students' personal data or using it for targeted advertising.",
  "These marketing programs are generally legal, taking advantage of the fact that there is no federal law regulating consumer data brokers.",
  "Consumers' personal details are collected in countless ways these days, from Instagram clicks, dating profiles and fitness apps.",
  "MyCollegeOptions, for instance, says it may give student loan services, test prep and other companies access to student data.",
  "Through their schools, many students in the audience had taken a college-planning questionnaire, called MyCollegeOptions.",
  "Ed Colby, a spokesman for ACT, said his organization would \"continue to abide by the highest standards of data privacy.\"",
  "(Until June, The New York Times had a contract with MyCollegeOptions to distribute codes for free trial subscriptions.",
  "The notice emphasized that pretest surveys could provide opportunities for families to learn about college choices.",
  "Over the last few years, several states have passed laws that might also limit the spread of some student profiles.",
  "Many colleges, universities and scholarship organizations buy such survey data to pinpoint prospective students.",
  "Parents can earn $10 for each teacher-generated nomination, he said, and $100 for each new student who enrolls.",
  "And one of those universities disclosed students' survey data to the for-profit National Leadership Academies.",
  "\"Students and families don't realize that the data may come back to them as misleading marketing,\" she said.",
  "He added that the National Leadership Academies requested and was denied access to student data in January.",
  "\"There's been a shift, and people now need to know, deserve to know: 'Where does this all come from?'\"",
  "Others had taken surveys that came with the SAT or the PSAT, tests administered by the College Board.",
  "He added that the College Board had previously terminated accounts when users violated its policies.",
  "Some families find educational value in events that identify their children through surveys.",
  "The alert also said students could opt out of college surveys that share their information.",
  "But it also reminded schools that parents had the right to inspect all surveys in advance.",
  "Other survey services, however, sell students' personal information far beyond colleges.",
  "ACT also prohibits clients from sharing students' data with third parties, he said.",
  "The College Board charges educational institutions 43 cents per student name.",
  "\"Does that make it less appropriate to tell them they are special?\"",
  "\"You are giving them the liberty to profit off your information.\"",
  "Starting in September, the ACT will charge 45 cents per name.",
