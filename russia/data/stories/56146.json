  "A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation Thursday to strengthen enforcement of a lobbying law that former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have been charged with violating by special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation.",
  "Those indictments, along with controversy over former national security adviser Michael Flynn's delay in registering as a foreign agent for work he did on behalf of Turkey, has shined a spotlight on the 80-year-old foreign agents law and its lax enforcement.",
  "The bipartisan bill introduced Thursday would create a dedicated unit within the Justice Department to enforce the law, end loopholes that allow lobbyists to avoid penalties, and increase public access to disclosure reports.",
  "Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., on the bill to force Americans acting as agents of Russia or other foreign governments to disclose their activities to the Department of Justice.",
  "Manafort and Gates were charged with lobbying on behalf of the pro-Russian former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, while failing to register as foreign agents as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",
  "In the past, the Justice Department had interpreted its role as promoting voluntary compliance with the law rather than enforcing criminal penalties, according to the inspector general's report.",
  "Between 1966 and 2015, only seven criminal cases were prosecuted under the 80-year-old law, according to a report last year by the Justice Department's inspector general.",
  "\"It’s absolutely imperative that the public be aware of who is acting on behalf of foreign governments, particularly our adversaries,\" Shaheen said.",
  "“Many of these governments do not share our values and seek to exploit our system by anonymously employing agents to undermine American interests.\"",
  "After initially doing the same, Gates last week pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI and is now cooperating with Mueller.",
  "\"Simply stated, the intent of this law is to prevent foreign countries from interfering in our government,” Cornyn said.",
  "They were also charged with laundering millions of dollars, conspiring against the U.S and engaging in tax fraud.",
  "(Flynn is also a key figure in the Russia investigation and has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.)",
  "Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves federal court on Thursday, Nov. 2.",
  "It also would make it clear that violating the law is a criminal offense.",
