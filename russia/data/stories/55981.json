  "Joseph Goebbels employed the latest communications technology, including radio and motion pictures, and uber-stylish choreography to target the emotions of the Great Depression’s economically disadvantaged “forgotten man.”\n\nSecrecy cloaked propaganda, which troubled congressional investigators.",

  "Banning speech, even speech deemed un-American, risked further compromising democratic norms, civil libertarians warned.",
