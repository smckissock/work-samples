  "In May, former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper said his people could never “corroborate” its “sourcing.” In June, Mr. Comey derided it as “salacious and unverified.”\n\nYet none of this jibes with reports that the FBI debated paying Mr. Steele to continue his work.",
  "Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team—despite reading like “the National Enquirer,” as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it.",
  "If the Steele dossier reports (which appear to date back to June 2016) were making their way into the hands of senior DNC and Clinton political operatives, you can bet they were making their way to the Obama White House.",
  "The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week.",
  "Those names will matter, since someone at the DNC and at the Clinton campaign will need to explain how they somehow both forgot to list Fusion as a vendor in their campaign-finance filings.",
  "The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a “dossier” on Donald Trump is bombshell news.",
  "But while it is not unusual for law firms to hire opposition-research outfits for political clients, it is highly unusual for a law firm to pay bills without a client’s approval.",
  "So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?",
  "Or that Mr. Comey was so convinced by the dossier that he pushed to have it included in the intelligence community’s January report on Russian meddling.",
  "In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.",
  "And the more ugly info that came out (Fusion, Democratic clients, intelligence-for-hire) the more former Obama officials seemed skeptical of it.",
  "Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records.",
  "The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news.",
  "Some Justice Department lawyer is presumably already looking into whether this was a willful evasion, which can carry criminal penalties.",
  "Somewhere, Perkins Coie has documents showing who signed off on those bills, and they aren’t protected by attorney-client privilege.",
  "It’s a little fishier when two entities both fail to list the firm that supplied them the most explosive hit job in a generation.",
  "Of course, they were doing so on the basis of “salacious and unverified” accusations made by anonymous Russians, but never mind.",
  "The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm’s walls.",
  "Imagine if it turns out the FBI was duped by a politically contracted document that might have been filled up by the Kremlin.",
  "We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway.",
  "Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure.",
  "Don’t forget that it wasn’t until January the dossier became public, and the media started unearthing details.",
  "The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case.",
  "On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.",
  "This may explain why Obama political appointees began monitoring the Trump campaign and abusing unmasking.",
  "Every senior Democrat is disclaiming knowledge of the dossier deal, leaving Perkins Coie holding the bag.",
  "And there are still bombshells with regard to unmasking of Americans in surveilled communications.",
  "We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it.",
  "If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians.",
  "Advertisement\n\nThere’s plenty yet to come with regard to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.",
  "No, this probe of the Democratic Party’s Russian dalliance has a long, long way to go.",
  "It’s one thing to forget to list that local hot-dog supplier for the campaign picnic.",
  "They were looking for a “gotcha,” something to disqualify a Trump presidency.",
  "And, let us hope, with revelations too big for even the media to ignore.",
  "With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele?",
  "Or that it didn’t know, which would be equally disturbing.",
  "Advertisement\n\nFBI bombshells are also yet to come.",
  "The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.",
  "The answers are in Fusion’s bank records.",
  "It might show the bureau was simply had.",
  "Advertisement\n\nWrite to kim@wsj.com.",
  "The Fusion GPS saga isn’t over.",
  "More bombshells are to come.",
  "Who else was paying it?",
  "Whom did it pay?"
