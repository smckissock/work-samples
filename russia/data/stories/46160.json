  "Those who pay their bills online, authorize their banks to pay bills automatically, purchase personal and professional goods and services online and subscribe to social media platforms where we share our recipes, travels and feelings, among other online activities, are vulnerable in many new ways.",
  "The \"fake news,\" Cambridge Analytica scandal and the weak response (to date) by Facebook's CEO, has exposed Facebook's business model and shattered the trust subscribers (at least some subscribers) assumed was a huge part of their social relationship with Facebook.",
  "I could demographically and behaviorally segment the world, or at least a couple billion of us, into “made-just-for-you” packages of videos, films, documentaries, ads, music, games, politicians and augmented/virtual reality-based immersive, interactive experiences.",
  "In order to completely to restore trust, Facebook will have to install controls – including real-time fact-checkers – and permit subscribers to further limit the information they -- and third parties -- share on the platform.",
  "The tipping point is when the value of convenience and opportunity falls below our personal and professional exposure and risk – and the need many of us to be part of a digital community (for whatever reasons we feel).",
  "Initially, that percentage will be relatively small, but if there are additional breaches and Facebook fails to fix its problems, more and more will restrict their use of the platform (and all social media platforms).",
  "But if Facebook discourages usage and enables subscribers to restrict their data, their ad revenue – and stock price – will fall simply because the value of the data Facebook aggregates and sells will fall.",
  "Many of you do, so let’s just accept the need for community, the real “social network,” and how essential many of you believe the photos of high school friends you haven’t seen in years really are.",
  "The problem for Facebook is that the response must remain weak simply because the Facebook business model depends directly on the value of the data it collects on its subscribers.",
  "Everyone now needs to decide how they want to be wired to those who regulate those who know where you live, what you do, how you think, what you believe and how you feel.",
  "But now the platforms are exposed as the for-profit engines they always were: Facebook's (nearly all ad) revenue in 2017 was $40B and its net profit was a whopping $16B.",
  "Until recently, Facebook – and other social media platforms – operated as a kind of invisible facilitator of personal and professional communications of all kinds.",
  "The 2B+ subscribers generated that revenue and profit – but very few of those subscribers think of themselves as pistons of revenue and profit for Facebook.",
  "The business opportunity is obvious: use consumer/citizen secrets to personalize and monetize content – and then laser target consumer/citizen assets.",
  "Without adequate privacy controls, this will spill over onto the other platforms pretty quickly and inevitably lead to federal and state legislation.",
  "Right now, Facebook is taking the heat for the other collectors and sellers of personal data, but its role as industry shield is temporary.",
  "Some percentage of subscribers will become very careful about whom they befriend and what they reveal about themselves on the platform.",
  "We’re painting intimate self-portraits for everyone to see, and before the paint's even dry the portraits are up for sale.",
  "The gold lies with the ability to know what consumers and citizens like and dislike and customize campaigns accordingly.",
  "Just how valuable is the photo of that high school friend or old girl/boyfriend you haven’t seen in years– or decades?",
  "In the digital age, where so much of our lives are online, we have created a vulnerability that never existed before.",
  "They already know everything, even if they haven’t yet developed complete profiles of us and the people in our lives.",
  "As advanced and especially augmented analytics improves – and they will – our profiles will be completed – and sold.",
  "– except that they’re always available and “free” – and help them communicate with family, friends and associates.",
  "We volunteer tons of personal and professional information in exchange for convenience, opportunity and fun.",
  "Facebook (or regulators) may lead everyone to reassess their convenience/opportunity/privacy/risk ratios.",
  "Who else knows more about us than our social media “partners” and our Internet service providers (ISPs)?",
  "It's unlikely the trust (some, not all) subscribers placed in Facebook will ever be completely restored.",
  "I could customize and personalize content (and other products and services) of all kinds to my clients.",
  "The Europeans are well on their way through the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",
  "Why does everyone (indirectly) “pay” Facebook every time they access their Facebook account?",
  "Very few subscribers really thought about these platforms – Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.",
  "The fundamental issue around Facebook's breach of trust with its users is around privacy.",
  "If I knew everything about everyone, I’d be able to sell anything to anyone, or worse.",
  "They know where we go, where we eat, what we watch, what we like and how we vote.",
  "Do you really need to know what people like you think about people like you?",
  "Without the ability to target consumers and citizens, what good is the data?",
  "The social platforms have money to make – which is how they’re wired.",
  "But all that information can also be used to distort and manipulate.",
  "Are the photos of friends on vacation really that valuable?",
  "They know what we believe, who we love and who we hate.",
  "Or wearing the special hat you just bought?",
  "The conundrum for Facebook is existential.",
  "They know how we think – and how we feel.",
  "I warned you about all this before.",
  "Or the picture of you on vacation?",
  "Is this a digital conundrum?",
  "How much is too much?",
  "Facebook knows.",
  "Then what?"
