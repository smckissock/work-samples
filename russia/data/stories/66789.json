  "The Forgotten Warrior Memorial Wall, to be erected in Channahon State Park, outside Chicago, will also serve as a national reminder of all those who suffer the invisible but potentially devastating mental and emotional wounds of war.",

  "https://t.co/w8dwPluE2i pic.twitter.com/hWfnTZFV5I â€” Morris Herald-News (@MorrisHerald) July 26, 2016\n\nThe people behind the project also hope it will bring closure to the many families mourning their fallen heroes.",
