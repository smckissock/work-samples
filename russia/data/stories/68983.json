  "A prominent former deputy chief, Karl Rove, described it as the person who “goes to the meeting the chief can’t go to — he is an observer and manager who frees up the time of the chief.”\n\n“Whatever model you pick,” Rove added, “you gotta feel that you’ve got the right person in the job right from the get-go.”\n\nKelly has considered transitioning from the former to the latter, parceling out Nielsen’s duties to two people, but he has struggled to find somebody to fill the policy role.",
  "As Kelly has continued his search, he has taken on a bigger role in the policymaking process, leading the administration’s immigration negotiations on Capitol Hill and serving as a chief spokesman for the president on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that protects undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children and that Trump is working to make permanent in exchange for a broader crackdown on immigration.",
  "The White House was widely expected to make a public announcement about the position early this year, with officials floating a senior administration lawyer, Jim Carroll, as a likely replacement for Kirstjen Nielsen, a close Kelly confidante who accompanied him from the Department of Homeland Security to the West Wing last summer before the president tapped her to become Department of Homeland Security secretary.",
  "Though Kelly issued an on-the-record statement of support for Porter, calling him a “man of true integrity,” he was aware that Porter had been unable to obtain a full security clearance — and would not be able to do so — because an ex-wife had taken out a protective order against him, according to a senior administration official.",
  "In the mix to fill the job of deputy chief of staff for policy had been Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who resigned Wednesday after his two ex-wives on Wednesday told the British tabloid the Daily Mail that he physically and emotionally abused them throughout their marriages.",
  "With Nielsen’s help, he dismissed aides he considered disruptive or whose duties he thought superfluous, from chief strategist Steve Bannon to Omarosa Manigault, a former contestant on Trump’s reality show “The Apprentice” who directed the Office of Public Liaison.",
  "Several administration officials left after the president’s first anniversary in office, including deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and White House economic adviser Jeremy Katz, who served as Gary Cohn’s deputy on the National Economic Council.",
  "Story Continued Below\n\nBut while Carroll has assumed some of the responsibilities of Nielsen’s old job, Kelly has been disappointed in his performance and has held back on officially bestowing the title, according to two administration officials.",
  "Traditionally, there have been two models for the role: one in which the deputy chief has served as the right hand of the chief of staff, the other in which two or more people have served as umpires of policymaking and White House operations.",
  "Kelly’s struggle to replace his own team members is perhaps the clearest illustration of the problems he faces trying to keep President Donald Trump’s administration staffed as officials who joined in the first year leave.",
  "The deputy chief post took on increased significance last July when Kelly joined the White House and made Nielsen his right-hand woman, entrusting her with much of the day-to-day responsibility for running the White House.",
  "The deputy chief of staff position, along with the people who hold it, is obscure to most outside the government, but its occupant serves as the principal aide to the chief of staff — the presidential deputy’s deputy.",
  "Given their close bond and her vast responsibilities, the subject of who would replace Nielsen — or whether anybody could do so, in Kelly’s eyes — has become a matter of major speculation inside the West Wing.",
  "The White House on Wednesday said that he was not entertaining the idea and that Carroll had assumed Nielsen’s role, even though it has not issued a public statement to that effect.",
  "Dearborn holds the title of deputy chief of staff for policy but has never fully executed that role, and he, too, is expected to leave the White House in the coming weeks.",
  "To date, the personnel changes Kelly has implemented have always relied more on firing than hiring, an area that has proved a perpetual struggle.",
  "Kelly late Wednesday issued a second statement saying he had been “shocked” by the allegations against Porter and condemning domestic abuse.",
  "At the time, his goal was to impose order on a chaotic and unorthodox West Wing staff, and Nielsen became his trusted taskmaster.",
  "“Chief of staff Kelly is very pleased with the job Jim Carroll is doing,” deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said.",
  "For that reason, among others, Kelly had not tapped him for the job, according to a senior administration official.",
  "Katz was Kelly’s first choice to take on the policy portfolio shared by Nielsen and Rick Dearborn.",
