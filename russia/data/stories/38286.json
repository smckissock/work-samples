  "Fewer Americans are going to malls these days, and those who do increasingly are shopping at fast-fashion chains like H&M, Forever 21 and Zara, all of which have boosted their accessories sections in recent years.",
  "And increasingly, that means Claire’s — which this afternoon was running a “Buy 3, get 3 free” promotion — is side-stepped for similarly priced (sometimes cheaper) wares at competitors such as Forever 21 and H&M.",
