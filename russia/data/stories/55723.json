  "That is “specific justification exists, among other circumstances, where (i) the witness and the relative participated in a common business enterprise and the testimony to be elicited relates to that enterprise or its activities; (ii) the testimony to be elicited relates to illegal conduct in which there is reason to believe that both the witness and the relative were active participants; or (iii) testimony to be elicited relates to a crime involving overriding prosecutorial concerns.” Mueller’s team need not look beyond the three alternative justifications – any one is sufficient for the exception to apply; meanwhile, all three expressly apply to the father-son Flynns.",
  "Reporting further reflects that Flynn’s son attended a December 2015 dinner in Moscow with his father, who sat at a table with Russia’s President; that Russian television network RT paid for Flynn’s son’s travel to Moscow, and RT begrudgingly registered in early November 2017 as a foreign agent under FARA; Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 for work benefitting the Turkish government; and work for Turkish interests relating to Fethullah Gulen, the United States resident Turkish cleric accused of fomenting an attempted coup in 2016.",
  "In order for the Special Counsel to threaten and actually bring criminal charges against Flynn’s son, the prosecutors must believe, as set forth in the United States Attorney’ Manual (USAM), that Flynn’s son’s “conduct constitutes a criminal offense, the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction and that a substantial federal interest would be served by the prosecution.” Normally, DOJ policy would disfavor leveraging one close family member against another.",
  "This policy favoring prosecuting the corporate officials provides unequivocally that “Provable individual culpability should be pursued, particularly if it relates to high-level corporate officers, even in the face of an offer of a corporate guilty plea or some other disposition of the charges against the corporation.”\n\nOne of Mueller’s prosecutors was a member of the Enron Task Force that unabashedly leveraged threat of and actual family prosecutions for guilty pleas.",
  "With Special Counsel Robert Mueller expected to indict both Michael T. Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, and Flynn’s son, Michael G. Flynn, in connection with the investigation into Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, speculation is mounting as to whether the elder Flynn will plead guilty to help his son, and in the process help himself.",
  "In 1909, the United States Supreme Court articulated the legal principle that persuasively controls today, that “a corporation acts by its officers and agents, their purposes, motives and intent are just as much those of the corporation as are things done.” And, DOJ policy is very clear in its focus on individual accountability for the acts of a corporation.",
  "One need not look beyond the Enron prosecutions and guilty pleas of Andrew and Lea Fastow, husband and wife, and the Drexel-related guilty plea of Michael Milken, with Lowell Milken (his brother) averting prosecution, to find the use of this tactic in high profile white-collar prosecutions, that is outside of organized crime and gang prosecutions.",
  "If Mueller’s team were to charge the elder Flynn, and particularly if the elder Flynn were to enter a guilty plea to some charge or charges, then the Special Counsel indictment of Paul Manafort and Robert Gates and the George Papadopolous Statement of the Offense related to Papadopolous’ guilty plea certainly shed light on potential charges.",
  "Based on the public reports of the subject matters of the investigation around the elder Flynn, Mueller likely would, at a minimum, include material false statements or omissions on filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and possibly on his security clearance form or FBI interview.",
  "Lea Fastow, his wife, who had an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and left Enron in 1997 as its Assistant Treasurer, had her name on various bank accounts targeted in the investigation and was a participant in a number of Enron’s off-balance-sheet partnerships.",
  "While Flynn certainly is focused on his own potential liability, that his son is a “subject” of the investigation places the elder Flynn in the difficult position of cooperating and accepting criminal culpability, rather than fight, in order possibly to prevent his son from being prosecuted.",
  "However, the elder Flynn’s legal team having stopped communicating with the President’s legal defense team may suggest that prosecutors have expressed privately their intent to bring such charges against Flynn and his son, and that they may be negotiating a resolution.",
  "There should be no confusion that somehow the conduct is by the Flynn Intel Group, instead of by its founder/owner (Michael T. Flynn) or its Chief of Staff and active participant in day-to-day operations, including meetings and communications (Michael G. Flynn).",
  "Rather, prosecutors will need evidence of Flynn’s son’s actual intentional participation in criminal acts or his intentionally conspiring with his father to commit a criminal act, in order to bring criminal charges.",
  "In connection with their guilty pleas, the Judge sentenced Lea Fastow to one year for a federal tax crime and Andrew Fastow to six years for two counts of conspiracy, which he served after Lea Fastow left prison.",
  "The decisions that Andrew Fastow and Kopper made to plead guilty and cooperate were similar to Michael Milken’s plea in the early 1990s to prevent the Government from pursuing prosecuting his brother, Lowell.",
  "The extensive reporting around the involvement of Flynn’s son certainly suggests there is legitimate justification for interpreting the Flynn component of the investigation as a prosecutable family affair.",
  "The unanswered questions to which the public awaits answers are will the elder Flynn strike a deal, whether and to what extent that deal will protect his son, and against whom will both Flynns cooperate.",
  "The conduct is foreign agent registration and undisclosed interactions with foreign governments, not manipulating financial transactions and statements to the detriment of shareholders.",
  "Federal prosecutors leveraging one family member against another is a page directly out of a four-decade old prosecutorial playbook used successfully in Wall Street prosecutions.",
  "The terms of the plea required Kopper to surrender $12 million, which represented the gain that he and his domestic partner, William Dodson, received on a $125,000 investment.",
  "The elder Flynn’s lawyers recently stopped communicating with the President’s legal defense team, which some interpret as Flynn preparing to cooperate with Mueller.",
  "Enron prosecutors successfully used a similar plea leveraging strategy earlier in the case against Michael Kopper, described as Fastow’s principal lieutenant.",
  "Media reports identify Flynn’s son as the Chief of Staff and principal aide to his father at Flynn Intel Group, his father’s consulting and lobbying firm.",
  "The plea deal offered to the Fastows was to stagger their prison sentences so that the children would not be deprived of both parents at the same time.",
  "Subsequently, the Fastows negotiated a plea agreement that reduced significantly the potential jail time for Lea Fastow and effectively protected her.",
  "The terms of the plea also required Andrew Fastow to cooperate against Enron’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, which he did.",
  "Prosecutors had charged both Michael and Lowell Milken in what was considered, at the time, the largest criminal case in Wall Street history.",
  "In October 2002, the Government indicted Andrew Fastow for conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering.",
  "For Michael Milken to agree to plead guilty, he remained steadfast that the Government drop all charges against his brother.",
  "Considerable attention has focused on the potential bases for the investigation and possible prosecution of the elder Flynn.",
  "Flynn’s son’s attending meetings and communicating with clients are not, of themselves, criminal offenses.",
  "In May 2003, the Government filed a superseding indictment that also included Lea Fastow and seven others.",
  "The culpability of and potential charges against Flynn’s son, based on public reports, is less clear.",
  "Kopper pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.",
  "The facts and locations are different, but the leveraging for plea tactics are the same.",
  "Michael Milken received a 10-year prison sentence and paid a $600 million fine.",
  "The Flynn scenario, however, falls expressly within an exception.",
  "In 2006, a federal judge sentenced Kopper to 37 months in jail.",
  "At the time, the Fastows had two small children, ages 5 and 8.",
  "The plea deal resulted in no prosecution of Dodson.",
  "Andrew Fastow was Enron’s Chief Financial Officer.",
  "Kopper cooperated and testified against others.",
  "The Flynns are K Street, not Wall Street.",
  "Family loyalty is still family loyalty."
