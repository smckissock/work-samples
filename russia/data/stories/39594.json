  "But the Belle Plaine City Council voted Monday night to do away with a free-speech zone in Veterans Memorial Park where a monument with a Christian cross sits — and where the satanic monument would have been installed as well, the Shakopee Valley News reported.",
  "The city green-lighted the satanic monument after a religious freedom group threatened to sue in order to get it installed in the park — a decision that drew national attention to the city.",
  "The Satanic Temple’s monument — a black cube adorned with pentagrams and an upturned helmet — would have been the first satanic monument installed on public property in U.S. history.",
  "It was first removed from the park — but after the park's free-speech zone was created, that opened the door for the installation of up to 10 monuments containing any symbolism.",
  "It’s been non-stop controversy for a year now.”\n\nBelle Plaine resident Kyle Tietz told the station he'd prefer the city council stick with the free-speech zone.",
  "Several members of Minnesota’s Left Hand Path Community, which supports the satanic monument, also showed up at the protest, the News said.",

  "“Our intent was good … but it just became too convoluted,” council member Theresa McDaniel said, according to the News.",
  "A satanic monument that had been scheduled for installation at a Minnesota park won't be going up after all.",
  "Residents had a tough fight getting the cross monument in the park, as it contains a religious symbol.",
  "Over 100 people protested against the satanic monument Saturday, WCCO-TV reported.",
  "Coop also told the News that “I think people are really, really tired of it.",
  "That’s what makes this country great … This is the veterans park, isn’t it?",
  "That’s what they fought for.”\n\n(H/T: Heat Street)",
  "“They fought a battle, they made a decision.",
  "“Let everybody put their own things up.",
  "Stick with it,” he told WCCO.",
  "Everybody has an opinion."
