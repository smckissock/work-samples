[
  "He began by asking Zuckerberg, “Are you familiar with Andrew Bosworth?” Graham spoke with a lawyer’s knowing tone, and Zuckerberg, seeming to understand the game being played, replied casually, “Yes, Senator, I do.” Bosworth, a vice-president at Facebook, became the subject of controversy last month, when BuzzFeed published an internal memo that he had written in 2016, in which he espoused a no-holds-barred philosophy of growth that was completely at odds with the message of responsibility that Zuckerberg was now pushing before Congress.",
  "Yet the frenzy leading up to the event—the outpouring of scorn for Zuckerberg’s prepared testimony, which was released on Monday; the snark about his decision to swap his cotton coder’s T-shirt for a suit and tie; a chest-beating appearance on “Face the Nation” by Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana—made clear that, no matter how much Zuckerberg rehearsed with his small army of public-relations consultants, a flogging was in the making.",
  "After his opening statement, in which he pledged to take a “broader view of our responsibility,” Zuckerberg returned often to two refrains: “I’ll have my team get back to you” and “The details matter a lot.”\n\nEye-glazingly dull, the start of the hearing reflected little of the public’s mounting resentment against Facebook, its urgent need for catharsis.",
  "The immediate occasion for the hearing, which was convened by the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees, was the revelation, a few weeks ago, that Cambridge Analytica, the U.K.-based political-consulting firm that worked on Donald Trump’s 2016 Presidential campaign, had obtained the information of millions of Facebook users without their consent.",
  "The company’s former motto, “Move fast and break things,” Zuckerberg noted in the hearing, has now become “Move fast with stable infrastructure.” There seems to be a faith, expressed most strongly by the Democrats, that in partnership with the new-and-improved Zuckerberg these problems can be regulated away.",
  "of “communicating your displeasure with such thoughts, ’cause, if he had understood where you were at, he would have never said it to begin with.” Zuckerberg said, “Well, Senator, we try to run a company in a way that people can express different opinions internally.” Graham laughed.",
  "Although the memo was framed in an ugly way, it is not so fundamentally different from the ideology that has helped Facebook amass its monopolistic power: connection above all, underpinned by a business model that relies on gathering and exploiting as much user data as possible.",
  "With a dramatic flourish, Blumenthal had an aide produce a poster that outlined the terms of service for Kogan’s app—terms that Facebook had apparently approved, and which gave Kogan permission to sell and store the information that he had collected.",
  "What if I don’t want to receive those commercial advertisements?” Zuckerberg, looking comfortable in his suit, his blue tie slightly loosened, patiently explained that there was an option for people to turn off targeted advertising if they wanted.",
  "The test metaphor proved apt: senators demanded transparency, accountability, and support for new legislation, yet they addressed Zuckerberg as a brilliant student, one who might need a lesson in responsibility but had plenty to offer in return.",
  "The company is still, as Tim Wu recently pointed out in the Times, a machine for “maximizing the harvest of data and human attention.” Coöperating in the fantasy that it has our best interests in mind heightens the danger it poses.",
  "It concerned Aleksandr Kogan, the Moldovan-born psychologist who used a personality-quiz app to harvest data from tens of millions of Facebook users and then passed the information along to Cambridge Analytica.",
  "The hearing was given the dry title “Facebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data,” but everyone on Capitol Hill and beyond knew that this performance was about something more.",
  "Facebook has undertaken a remarkable campaign to fix its image, and Zuckerberg’s appearances on Capitol Hill—on Tuesday before the Senate, on Wednesday before the House—are a part of that.",
  "“I’m communicating with my friends on Facebook and indicate that I love a certain kind of chocolate,” Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, said at one point, by way of example.",
  "“We’ve seen the apology tours before.”\n\nLindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, proved the most effective of all the senators at evoking the public’s anger and frustration.",
  "Zuckerberg would have to persuade the American people that he was a trustworthy steward not only of their most sensitive personal information but also of their discourse online.",
  "A report in the Times characterized this as Zuckerberg’s “dreaded final exam,” the culmination of a months-long saga that has left his and Facebook’s reputations in tatters.",
  "The first chunk of real red meat was thrown to the Twitter hordes by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, and the former attorney general of that state.",
  "By dragging him into the hearing, Graham was making things personal in a way that the previous senators, who focussed on policies and regulations, had not.",
  "The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good.",
  "Since March, Zuckerberg has consistently described Kogan’s activities as a breach of trust, a violation of the platform’s policies.",
  "The Bosworth affair, and Zuckerberg’s response, illustrate why so many people now have such a visceral skepticism of Facebook.",
  "Bosworth was Zuckerberg’s teaching fellow at Harvard, and he has been intimately involved in many of the company’s decisions.",
  "“Well, this is an opinion that really disturbs me, and if somebody worked for me that said this, I’d fire him,” he said.",
  "Many tried to wade into the technical details of how Facebook handles data, demonstrating only the most basic grasp.",
  "He said that “the vast majority of the people” at Facebook who had seen Boz’s memo had disagreed with it, too.",
  "Given the hype, though, it was hard not to feel a little let down by the first hour or so of the proceedings.",
  "of Facebook, finished the first round of his two-day congressional-hearing extravaganza.",
  "It was like watching your grandfather ask Henry Ford for a driving lesson.",
  "He tried to return to his talking points, but Blumenthal interrupted him.",
  "Yet Facebook’s business model and leadership structure are still there.",
  "“And all of a sudden I start receiving advertisements for chocolate.",
  "To call the hearing an exam suggests that there was a right answer.",
  "Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.",
  "Graham asked Zuckerberg if he believed what Bosworth had written.",
  "“What happened here was, in effect, willful blindness,” he said.",
  "(“Boz is what we call him internally,” Zuckerberg explained.)",
  "Graham asked if Zuckerberg had done a poor job as C.E.O.",
  "Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies.",
  "“Here is my reservation, Mr. Zuckerberg,” he said.",
  "In the note, Bosworth wrote,\n\nWe connect people.",
  "That isn’t something we are doing for ourselves.",
  "“No, Senator, I do not,” Zuckerberg replied.",
  "… That can be bad if they make it negative.",
  "That can be good if they make it positive.",
  "Last night, Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O.",
  "It is literally just what we do.",
  "Zuckerberg looked dumbstruck.",
  "Or for our stock price (ha!).",
  "And still we connect people.",
  "Blumenthal disagreed.",
  "We connect people.",
  "Period.",
