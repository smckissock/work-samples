  "Or, perhaps more likely in Trump’s case, what happens if the president tries to shut down FBI investigations into his commercial activities involving Russia, or into the actions of cronies like Manafort?",
  "One, in a sense, is a take on a question that Trump raised about Clinton during the campaign: what happens if the Federal Bureau of Investigation finds evidence of criminal conduct by the president?",
  "Trump severed public ties with Manafort only after Ukraine’s current democratic government revealed documents that hinted at the millions of dollars that Yanukovych had paid Manafort, in cash.",

  "At the end of “The Manchurian Candidate,” another brainwashed character – Frank Sinatra’s Marco – escapes his programming to foil the communist plot.",
  "Donald Trump’s transition from U.S. President-elect to taking power recalls nothing so much as a forgotten Hollywood genre: the paranoid melodrama.",
  "share is not the result of brainwashing, unless you consider the love of money (and of the people who can funnel it to you) a form of brainwashing.",

  "The idea that a U.S. president-elect would take the word of the Kremlin over that of the CIA is bizarre and dangerous.",
