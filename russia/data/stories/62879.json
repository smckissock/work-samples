  "While Lazar's claims cannot be independently verified, three computer security specialists, including two former senior intelligence officials, said the process described is plausible and the Clinton server, now in FBI custody, may have an electronic record that would confirm or disprove Guccifer’s claims.",
  "He said he talked to the FBI and “wrote up eight pages of notes” during the flight, stressing that “I have nothing to hide.”\n\nLazar told Fox News that, while imprisoned in Romania where he was serving a seven-year sentence, he met several times with U.S. agents from the FBI, Secret Service and Treasury.",
  "Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker \"Guccifer,\" told Fox News that he accessed Clinton’s server “like twice,” claiming that for him, “it was easy.”\n\nAsked about the claims at Thursday’s press briefing, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he’s not aware of such an incident.",
  "It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims.”\n\nHowever, Lazar provided extensive details about his hacking, in interviews from the Virginia jail where he is being held.",
  "He has pleaded not guilty to a nine-count federal indictment for his alleged hacking crimes in the U.S. Victims are not named in the indictment but reportedly include Colin Powell, a member of the Bush family and others including Blumenthal.",
  "The hacker spoke freely with Fox News from the detention center in Alexandria, Va., where he’s been held since his extradition to the U.S. on federal charges relating to other alleged cyber-crimes.",
  "The State Department joined the Hillary Clinton campaign Thursday in pushing back on Romanian hacker Guccifer’s claims that he successfully breached the former secretary of state’s personal server.",
  "Asked whether the server had been compromised by foreign hackers, she told MSNBC on Tuesday, “No, not at all.”\n\nRecently extradited, Lazar faces trial Sept. 12 in the Eastern District of Virginia.",
  "In response to Lazar’s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying, \"There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell.",
  "The 44-year-old Lazar said he first compromised Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal's AOL account, in March 2013, and used that as a stepping stone to the Clinton server.",
  "Lazar also told Fox News that during his flight to the U.S. from Romania on or about March 31, he was accompanied by an FBI agent and a State Department official.",
  "For me, it was not like the Hillary Clinton server, it was like an email server she and others were using with political voting stuff,\" Guccifer said.",
  "At the same time, Toner repeatedly stressed he did not want to comment on the security of the server, citing ongoing investigations.",
  "In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton's server are inaccurate.",
  "As recently as this week, Clinton said neither she nor her aides had been contacted by the FBI about the criminal investigation.",
  "He said he accessed Clinton’s server “like twice,” though he described the contents as “not interest[ing]” to him at the time.",
  "Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump reacted to the report Thursday, calling the claim by Guccifer \"very serious.\"",
  "Asked if he’s in a position to even know whether Lazar’s claims are true, Toner again said he did not want to comment.",
  "Fox News’ Catherine Herridge and Pamela Browne contributed to this report.",
  "“We don’t have any reason to believe that it might be true,” he said.",
  "\"If it's true it’s very serious,\" Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier.",
  "The Clinton campaign issued a more definitive denial.",
  "It’s what she did and why did she do it?\"",
  "\"It’s not a question of him.",
  "“I was not paying attention."
