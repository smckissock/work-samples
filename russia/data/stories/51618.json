  "As the two countries labor to reduce the wide gap between them over what denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula even means, one thing seems certain about a potential deal: Forget the Libya model, in which Muammar Qaddafi gave up his weapons-of-mass-destruction program, lock, stock, and barrel, before receiving any benefits in return.",
  "Moreover, a deal would include a set of timelines for reducing the warheads and weapons delivery systems the North possesses — for example, the US is keen to remove the long-range ballistic missiles the Kim regime tested over the first year of Trump's tenure and which may be capable of reaching the US West Coast.",
  "Any deal would have to include a full and verifiable accounting of the North's nuclear arsenal, delivery systems, and technologies — in other words, Pyongyang would have to come clean on what it possesses in a way it never has before, these experts say.",
  "Andrew Harnik/AP\n\n\"The biggest gap in all of this is how we define denuclearization, and how the North Koreans define it,\" says Victor Cha, who served in the George W. Bush White House as the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs.",
  "President Donald Trump, Kim Yong Chol, former North Korean military intelligence chief and one of leader Kim Jong Un's closest aides, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stand after their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.",
  "Yet while the timing of any deal may now be clear — good-bye \"all at once,\" hello process and step-by-step — there is still little clarity just a week before the leaders are to meet in Singapore on what the specific steps in any deal might be.",
  "For example, Dr. Cha says convincing Kim to give up every one of his estimated two to five dozen nuclear warheads is \"not going to happen,\" given the central place Kim sees an established nuclear status playing in his regime's survival.",
  "Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nWith President Trump's June 12 summit with Kim Jong-un back on track, attention has turned once again to what a denuclearization deal between the United States and North Korea might look like.",
  "But if the hurdle of defining \"denuclearization\" can be crossed in a way that meets both sides' needs, experts say, then a historic deal incorporating the other key elements might indeed be attainable.",
  "However experts in North Asian and nonproliferation issues, some with decades of experience dealing with North Korea, say there are some key elements that will almost certainly be part of any deal.",
  "For its part, North Korea has consistently spoken of denuclearization as a long-term and aspirational concept, encompassing the US nuclear presence on the peninsula as well as its own programs.",
  "One reason the North Korea case is so complicated is that Pyongyang already possesses nuclear weapons and some sophisticated means, including long-range missiles, of delivering those warheads.",
  "It's been the new White House national security adviser, John Bolton, who has pressed for a deal with Mr. Kim on the order of what Mr. Qaddafi agreed to in 2003 with the Bush administration.",
  "Mr. Bolton and others in the administration have shifted to speaking of the \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization\" of the Korean Peninsula, or \"CVID\" for short.",
  "By the time Mr. Trump announced Friday that the summit he had abruptly canceled a week earlier was back on, the talk had veered sharply from quick action to gradual steps.",
  "Moreover, many experts now say, it is likely to resemble past US deals with North Korea — including those launched with fanfare, only to collapse later.",
  "Verification\n\nA North Korean security officer wears a pin depicting North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung.",
  "Virtually no one — including the US intelligence community in a recent assessment — sees Kim agreeing to give every piece of his nuclear program.",
  "Trump now speaks of a \"process\" and a likely series of summits instead of just one, with references to incremental implementation of any accord.",
  "But it was also all the White House talk of applying that pattern to North Korea that spooked Kim and nearly jettisoned plans for the summit.",
  "First among key elements, the US and North Korea would have to narrow the gap between them over just what \"denuclearization\" means.",
  "North Korea openly compares itself to India, which weathered a period of international rejection of its nuclear arsenal.",
  "\"'Denuclearization of the Peninsula' is a phrase the North Koreans have used for decades.\"",
  "The clear message from Pyongyang: We are not Libya, so citing it is a dead end.",
  "Even Vice President Mike Pence started touting the model.",
  "The result?"
