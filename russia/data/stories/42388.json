  "Compare this with Facebook’s decree that its news feed would prioritise personal stories over media content, without any apparent indication that it considered the impact on journalism.",
  "As the Cambridge Analytica files show, the platform appears to prioritise advertisers over users, and doesn’t do enough to control how the data it collects is handled by third parties.",
  "The basic technical protocols that allow this kind of collaboration are still in place, but the profit motive and market centralisation have undermined their effectiveness.",
  "We need transparent and participatory approaches to rule making\n\nIn the first place, it is critical that we understand this as a systemic problem with the business model.",
  "“The internet’s inherent value and power come from the fact that it is globally interoperable and decentralised,” writes the internet freedom advocate Rebecca MacKinnon.",
  "The blockchain also has the potential – well beyond cryptocurrencies – to help people deal with each other without having to rely on a centralised platform or ledger.",

  "The internet began as a decentralised network, but market consolidation has effectively changed this, even if its technical underpinnings have remained unchanged.",
  "Of course, Facebook is not the only offender: Amazon and Google have enough fingers in enough pies to make digital oligarchies a problem we can no longer ignore.",
  "We have the technical capacity to chat, cooperate and trade directly with each other, without relying on private platforms that measure value in ad revenue.",

  "There are arguments, there is consensus, and there is everything in between – all of which is documented for anyone to see.",
  "The Facebook executive team is clearly unaccustomed to managing democratic processes and genuine community collaboration.",
