  "[09:20:02]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I still don't see how it moves the peace process forward.",
  "This is...\n\n\n\nHALEY: We did not talk about boundaries or borders for a reason.",
  "He believes the women who have charged and made allegations against Roy Moore.",
  "I mean, it's very atypical to vote in December and it's a very difficult time.",
  "It's -- it's a lot of relief for a lot of the working people and middle class.",
  "Aired 9-10a ET\n\nAired December 10, 2017 - 09:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.",
  "Santa Trump also thinks that former FBI director James Comey has been naughty.",
  "So Moore is denying it but what about a man who admits to things like murder?",
  "I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is heading South.",
  "Marc just highlighted it and I'm not even sure he realized he highlighted it.",
  "I mean, if they already had done that, why bother reaching out to Hope Hicks?",
  "This is an effort to tear at the very idea that there is an objective truth.",
  "TAPPER: The president has gone a lot farther than that though, to be honest.",
  "Now I'm in the category firming believing that Doug Jones can win this race.",
  "[09:40:00]\n\n\n\nAmanda, kind of a stark example for President Obama to sight.",
  "But for Santa Trump determining who is naughty or nice, that's complicated.",
  "And that is going to part of the -- what is going to happen in the future.",
  "I think that the Senate has to look at who is fit to serve in the Senate.",
  "When it comes to those that are upset, we knew that was going to happen.",
  "And they get to talk about how they want to see Jerusalem going forward.",
  "You then have Trump Jr. in private, secret communication with WikiLeaks.",

  "TAPPER: But not everyone in the Republican Party is with the president.",
  "But we are going to continue keep up the pressure, because we have to.",
  "But, you know, I don't know that sanctions are going to work with him.",
  "SELLERS: That's fundamentally the problem with this country right now.",
  "CARPENTER: I don't agree with all of it, but I agree with some of it.",
  "Now that might land him on Santa Claus' naughty list but Santa Trump?",
  "I plan to support the bill when it comes out of conference committee.",
  "The Senate just overwhelmingly again voted to have the embassy moved.",
  "AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Sometimes, you have to take risks.",
  "HALEY: Well, I think you have to look at, what did the sanctions do?",
  "LOTTER: Many people have said these are very troubling allegations.",
  "It's now December, and those sanctions have yet to be implemented.",
  "So, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the sky is still up there.",
  "When it comes down to it on Tuesday, who would you rather see win?",
  "I understand we would like to retain that seat in the U.S. Senate.",
  "SHELBY: Well, I -- I understand that's already being contemplated.",

  "TAPPER: President Trump checks off one of his campaign promises.",
  "SHELBY: I'm not going to tell you that, anymore than you do, OK?",
  "And that's the subject of this week's \"State of the Cartoonion.\"",
  "He's talking about rebuilding hospitals that are falling apart.",
  "This president said, for 22 years, that waiting didn't help us.",

  "TRUMP: I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.",
  "I didn't vote for the Democrat or advocate for the Democrat.",

  "The Americans just said, we want our embassy in the capital.",
  "They cut off 90 percent of the trade, 30 percent of the oil.",
  "And not have to try to rally or push people out last minute.",
  "Is there any evidence at all that this approach is working?",
  "TAPPER: Madam Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us.",
  "Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley joins me live.",
  "THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.",
  "But I want to reiterate again I didn't vote for Roy Moore.",
  "Whether that is Judge Moore or whether that is Doug Jones.",
  "TRUMP: Director Comey was very unpopular with most people.",
  "The polls that have them down had it at about 17 percent.",
  "SHELBY: Well, I don't have to answer that question today.",
  "TAPPER: President Trump obviously is all in on Roy Moore.",
  "Take a listen to what he said in his resignation speech.",
  "TAPPER: He says it's going to boost the economy, though.",
  "How does this move the peace process forward in any way?",
  "He's encouraging African- Americans to come out to vote.",
  "I mean, the president is out there saying, vote for him.",
  "Comey probably has the president on the list of his own.",
  "You have someone who literally imprisoned Eric Rudolph.",
  "Do you think that Doug Jones can pull this off, Bakari?",
  "It may have been one that people want to shy away from.",
  "SELLERS: About two weeks ago I would have told you no.",
  "But Doug Jones is in Alabama talking about Doug Jones.",
  "They get to decide what the\n\n\n\nborders will look like.",
  "And, mainly, that's because of our fight against Iran.",
  "Take a listen to something President Trump on Friday.",
  "But I do want to get to North...\n\n\n\nHALEY: That's OK.",
  "If I don't see you, Merry Christmas, happy new year.",
  "You know, as a Republican, I had to vote Republican.",
  "[09:55:02]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Starting with two former pals.",
  "HALEY: The American people have agreed with that.",
  "And I know some conservatives are offended by it.",
  "And that will be ruinous to the Republican Party.",
  "That's an issue that we have been investigating.",
  "That's something that we all want as Americans.",
  "And so it may have been an interesting example.",
  "Like, what does the Republican Party stand for?",
  "I understand where the president's coming from.",
  "But I wrote in a distinguished Republican name.",
  "And that's what we're going to continue to do.",
  "A new diplomatic fallout as well this morning.",
  "How does it help the peace process in any way?",
  "TRUMP: They're filled with West Virginia coal.",
  "And, you know, you have to listen to him also.",
  "Well, he's also in Santa Trump's nice column.",
  "So, the president did the will of the people.",
  "I don't know what is going to happen Tuesday.",
  "It depends on the turnout, and go from there.",
  "It got to the point where the FBI stepped in.",
  "And the president made full use of that help.",
  "But on Tuesday, we're talking about Alabama.",
  "So, why shouldn't we have the embassy there?",
  "Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations.",
  "How much further up the chain will this go?",
  "I think it's a step in the right direction.",
  "I think the Republican Party can do better.",
  "And I think you will see all this play out.",
  "(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, let me ask you.",
  "And he can use any example that he chooses.",
  "But the intent here is not to do oversight.",
  "Congressman, thanks so much for being here.",
  "But we haven't seen the actual connection.",
  "So, we have all these facts in chronology.",
  "He wants to see a Republican in that seat.",
  "He's talking about jobs in the black belt.",
  "Senator, thank you so much for joining us.",
  "And I think a lot of people could do that.",
  "TAPPER: Lumps of coal for Chuck and Nancy.",
  "Say Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte?",
  "SHELBY: I think the women are believable.",
  "Madam Ambassador, always good to see you.",
  "The idea of race is a very sensitive one.",
  "And what this does just say what is real.",
  "And Alabama is going to be a close race.",
  "And we will see what happens after that.",
  "(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Do it.",
  "(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Do it.",
  "TRUMP: We have had a great relationship.",
  "Do you believe these two Alabama women?",
  "I'm not going to vote for the Democrat.",
  "An entire world was plunged into chaos.",
  "TURNER: I mean, we are giving it a try.",
  "That's not for the Americans to decide.",
  "TAPPER: OK. Well, I await that booking.",
  "I do think it was an error in judgment.",
  "TAPPER: But what about East Jerusalem?",
  "TAPPER: And let's turn to the economy.",
  "There's -- we call it a tipping point.",
  "I don't know what is going to happen.",
  "The state of Alabama deserves better.",
  "And we have a lot of other sanctions.",
  "Yes, but they had the means to do it.",
  "It's not -- it doesn't lack any fact.",
  "So you got a pay attention and vote.",
  "Take a listen to what he had to say.",
  "It just doesn't make rational sense.",
  "Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.",
  "And that's the way he phrased that.",
  "I said, I can't vote for Roy Moore.",
  "But there's a lot of stories there.",
  "So, get out and vote for Roy Moore.",
  "That's how legislation comes about.",
  "So, get out and vote for Roy Moore.",
  "(BOOING)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We can't do it.",
  "They get to decide the boundaries.",
  "So, now they get to come together.",
  "That's a very dangerous situation.",
  "But I couldn't vote for Roy Moore.",
  "Thanks one and all for being here.",
  "It seems like a pretty tall order.",
  "TAPPER: What about East Jerusalem?",
  "Let's turn to North Korea, though.",
  "And we are in lockstep with them.",
  "How are we going to move forward?",
  "HALEY: Well, I can tell you this.",
  "[09:35:04]\n\n\n\nThat story is next.",
  "[09:05:05]\n\n\n\nBut I wasn't there.",
  "(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hello.",
  "TAPPER: OK. That's the nice list.",
  "He recorded a robo-call for him.",
  "Now let's try and move the ball.",
  "And then 60 million people died.",
  "He talked about the rule of law.",
  "TAPPER: What do you think, Nina?",
  "And it going to be a tough haul.",
  "I have never voted in December.",
  "I'm going to hope for the best.",
  "They are stressed out about it.",
  "Take a listen to the president.",
  "Got to be some fire somewhere.",
  "I wouldn't vote for Roy Moore.",
  "He just took it off the table.",
  "We can grow this economy more.",
  "I couldn't vote for Roy Moore.",
  "And that capital in Jerusalem.",
  "In fact, it is very much true.",
  "However, it is not historical.",
  "This has been very successful.",
  "What is wrong with saying it?",
  "That's a very important move.",
  "HALEY: Merry Christmas, Jake.",
  "I -- there -- there's a time.",
  "We have to prove that we can.",

  "TAPPER: Just not that one.",
  "TAPPER: What do you think?",
  "He says it didn't happen.",
  "And who has been naughty?",
  "We got to give it a shot.",
  "They have made progress.",
  "SCHIFF: I can't comment.",
  "That's a problem for me.",
