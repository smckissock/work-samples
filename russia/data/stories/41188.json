  "(Jill Jasuta/Dorchester County Tourism) (Dorchester County Tourism Department)\n\nThere’s perhaps no better way to enjoy autumn than from the cockpit of a kayak, as the mirror-like surface of calm water transforms the fireworks of fall foliage into an impressionistic painting for you to glide across.",
  "(Basia and John Shields)\n\nChincoteague National Wildlife Refuge\n\nSnug Harbor Marina, 7536 East Side Road, Chincoteague Island, Va.; open daily, 9 a.m.-5 p.m., through Oct. 15; $38 for half-day rental, $48 full day, $49 eco tour; 757-336-6176.",
  "Since Chincoteague is smack-dab in the middle of the Atlantic flyway — a migratory route for birds — you’re also likely to see flocks of ducks, geese and swans, which often alight in these protected wetlands en route to their summer homes.",
  "Kids will enjoy paddling around the knees of the bald cypress trees that poke up right out of the middle of the water and watching the turtles that sun themselves on the rocks — or slide off with a resounding “plop” when you kayak by.",
  "If the wildlife is feeling shy, there’s still plenty to see as you thread your way through an endless maze of tall grass, which turns yellow-orange in the fall and looks especially gorgeous in golden late-afternoon light.",
  "Navigating through the refuge’s dense network of waterways and handling the occasional fast-moving current can be tricky for newer kayakers, so be sure to stop by the visitor center, get a map and ask for recommendations.",

  "When couples get in them, I swear, they fight the entire time,” says Rachel Cooper, author of the new Mid-Atlantic edition of the Appalachian Mountain Club’s “Quiet Water” paddling guidebook series.",

  "Depending on where you paddle in the 8,000-acre refuge, you might not see another person for hours, so be sure to bring everything you need, including plenty of water to drink, Cooper says.",
  "If you’re lucky, you might happen upon the real ghost of the swamps, bitterns — brown-dappled waterbirds that seem to disappear into the marsh grass the moment they stand still.",
  "If you notice a flock lifting off, keep your eyes peeled for what alarmed them — perhaps a peregrine falcon or a bald eagle is soaring nearby, looking for a feathery lunch.",
  "You’re also likely to see flybys of migrating raptors, including the occasional golden eagle, as well as rafts of ducks like the northern pintail and green-winged teal.",
  "The oak and poplar woods that border Lums Pond turn every shade of orange, yellow and red in the fall, and their beauty multiplies on the glassy surface of the water.",
  "If you’re not an advanced paddler, stick to protected coves and narrow waterways, especially those that thread through cypress forest on the eastern side of the bay.",
  "It’s a totally different experience.”\n\nTippy and tough to maneuver, double kayaks are best reserved for times when you’re toting along a child or a dog, Cooper says.",
  "Join the party by bringing fishing gear (and a license) on your kayak trip, and you can nab dinner — maybe flounder, bluefish or sea trout — right from your boat.",
  "Your quiet reverie will be disturbed only by flocks of honking geese heading south for the winter — that is, if you’ve been wise enough to rent a single kayak.",
  "The two of them are advanced kayakers, but they found opportunities for all kinds of paddlers, regardless of skill level or particular interests, Cooper says.",
  "Or, tie a chicken neck to a string and catch yourself some Chesapeake Bay blue crabs; you can take home up to two dozen males per person without a license.",
  "If you’ve made the mistake of sharing a double kayak with someone, your peace will be constantly disturbed by the honking complaints of your co-paddler.",
  "(Somerset Tourism)\n\nDaugherty Creek: Janes Island State Park\n\nJanes Island State Park boat rental office, 26280 Alfred J. Lawson Drive, Crisfield, Md.",
