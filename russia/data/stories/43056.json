  "Lisa Larson-Walker\n\nTwenty years ago, a high-flying tech company behind the most popular online community of the day was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of “deceptive practices in connection with its collection and use of personal identifying information from consumers.” The company was in possession of an extraordinary amount of personal data, collected from its vast number of users, and questions were being raised as to what exactly it was allowed to do with that information.",
  "As Farhad Manjoo wrote in Slate upon the site’s 2009 closure, GeoCities in many ways invented the internet as we know it: “[I]t was the first big venture built on what is now hailed as the defining feature of the Web 2.0 boom—‘user-generated content.’ ”\n\nThese days, its “user-generated content” is regarded as something of a nostalgic joke: pages full of OTT graphics, sparkling/blinking/moving text, and endlessly rotating “Under Construction” gifs (many of which can be laughed at here).",
  "The web-hosting platform allowed its users, known as “homesteaders,” to create and customize their own personal webpages, locating them in one of GeoCities’ topically themed “neighborhoods,” such as Hollywood (film and actor-themed pages), Silicon Valley (computers, hardware, programming, and technology sites), Athens (teaching, education, reading, writing, and philosophy pages), or Area 51 (science fiction, fantasy, and the first centralized home for conspiracy theories online).",
  "“You’re talking about behavioral advertising, you’re talking about profiles based on likes and online activities and using that information to categorize an individual to determine whether that individual would be receptive to particular types of communication on political or consumer-based issues.”\n\nBut while GeoCities was accused of being actively misleading, can we really say the same about Facebook in the Cambridge Analytica case?",
  "“When the FTC came after GeoCities, all the other companies that are in the business are going like ‘Oh, OK, well, if … a company that I aspire to be has gained the attention of the FTC, I better make sure that my privacy practices are buttoned down.’ So it has an education and deterrent effect that gets the industry in line.”\n\nIf the congressional hearings with Mark Zuckerberg are anything to go by, the deterrent is not working.",
  "GeoCities assured its users that it would not share their registration info with third parties, with a note promising, “We will not share this information with anyone without your permission.” In spite of these assurances, the FTC claimed, GeoCities had “sold, rented or otherwise disclosed” user information to third-party marketers, which used it to target individuals with advertising offers beyond what they had agreed to.",
  "So although no legislation directly came out that said, ‘FTC, you’re in charge,’ the FTC has, over the last 20 years, been able to enforce privacy policy, enforce reasonable levels of security, and been appointed the leader in international privacy.”\n\nLazar believes the FTC may have been making an example of GeoCities.",
  "Those who opened the “This Is Your Digital Life” app regrettably chose to share their data to a third party, granting it permission to harvest their data and that of their friends for “academic purposes” (Aleksandr Kogan, who broke several promises, might be more analogous to GeoCities).",
  "Furthermore, the FTC alleged that GeoCities was misrepresenting its relationship with the GeoKidz Club, an interactive site aimed at children that appeared to be run and maintained by GeoCities itself—it was promoted by GeoCities in its child-focused “Enchanted Forrest” neighborhood.",
  "Though GeoCities was much smaller than Facebook, and the scope of what one could do with 1998 data much less sophisticated, it’s hard not to draw parallels between the internet’s first major consumer-privacy case and its most recent—one which definitely won’t be its last.",
  "In order to sign up for the service, GeoCities users were asked to provide certain personal information (some of which was optional, some not), including email and postal addresses, interest areas, income, education, gender, marital status, and occupation.",
  "One thing is clear from the Zuckerberg hearings: Twenty years on from the internet’s first ever consumer-privacy enforcement case, our framework for online data protection is sadly still “under construction.”\n\nRead more from Slate on Cambridge Analytica.",
  "“Because an enforcement agency has limited assets, you go after one company, and you try to get as much publicity as possible with the goal—and you can look at it one way or the other—of educating or instilling fear into the business world,” he said.",
  "“GeoCities misled its customers, both children and adults, by not telling the truth about how it was using their personal information,” Jodie Bernstein, then the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement at the time.",
  "The order was highly specific in terms of what practices GeoCities was required to disclose, yet nowhere near as detailed as the convoluted privacy policies we’ve come to expect—and agree to without reading or understanding—today.",
  "It also required GeoCities to post a detailed privacy policy on its site, outlining what info was being collected and for what purpose, with a “clear and prominent hyperlink or button labeled PRIVACY NOTICE” on the home page.",
  "GeoCities was also required to obtain parental consent before collecting information from children, a precursor to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which would be enacted in October of that year.",
  "But as ridiculous as GeoCities’ aesthetic may seem today, its pages and features—carefully archived by the Internet Archive—form an important, clunky relic of what the web looked like and how it grew.",
  "Bart Lazar, a privacy and intellectual property attorney who defended GeoCities, credits this case with having a big influence on the development of the online privacy domain moving forward.",
  "“I think the key difference between the GeoCities and the Facebook case has to do with the size of the number of individuals at stake and the amount of revenue that’s at stake,” said Lazar.",
  "The FTC alleged that GeoCities was lying to its customers by misrepresenting how it was using their personal information and was therefore in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.",
  "GeoCities collected comparatively basic intelligence: It knew its members’ email and postal addresses, interest areas, income, education, gender, marital status, and occupation.",
  "GeoCities was used primarily by early adopters of tech, and these net n00bs may have been especially naïve about giving away their data, still learning the rules of the game.",
  "In reality, the club was being run by third-party hosts, which were therefore able to collect and maintain children’s information—unregulated and unbeknownst to parents.",
  "In 1998, the New York Times reported that its audience was growing at “twice the speed of the average Web site.” (As the FTC complaint notes, “One out of five U.S.",
  "But Facebook never really made any secret of its interest in commercializing our data, other than placing it in convoluted and incomprehensible privacy policies.",
  "In mid-1998, just as GeoCities was preparing to go public, the FTC launched a complaint against the site, as part of its crackdown on online privacy practices.",
  "The activities that can be engaged in using personal data—both in its collection and analysis—are now much more sophisticated, as the 2016 election has shown.",
  "The FTC may have more online regulatory power than ever (it already has a 2011 consent order with Facebook), but the industry is most certainly not in line.",
  "Twenty years later, it seems as if those institutions have failed—we again find ourselves questioning what a popular platform is able to do with our data.",
  "GeoCities, then known as Beverly Hills Internet, launched in 1995, nine years before Facebook, eight before Myspace, three years even before Google.",
  "It’s hard not to see the GeoCities case repeating itself in today’s long-overdue Facebook reckoning—and not just because GIFs have come full circle.",
  "GeoCities, keen to resolve the matter quickly in order not to delay its IPO, agreed to a settlement with the FTC (with no admission of wrongdoing).",
  "Both sites represented unprecedented steps in online media for their time—and unprecedented dilemmas for privacy advocates and regulatory bodies.",
  "While early net pioneers forged new frontiers on the Wild Wild Web, government bodies and trade commissions argued over how best to regulate it.",
  "From this data, GeoCities came to be in possession of a valuable database—not Cambridge Analytica–level valuable, but hey, it was the ’90s.",
  "Web users visited respondent’s Web site in October 1997.”)\n\nGeoCities came along at a time when it wasn’t yet clear what the internet was.",
  "But even today, many Facebook users are clearly struggling to understand how much the company knows about them and how that data is used.",
  "The fact that Facebook once allowed users to sign away their data and their friends’ privacy so easily is its more damning conduct.",
  "But we’re not talking about billions of people around the world.”\n\nThe amount of data being collected also varies significantly.",
  "As it became a place not just to visit but to contribute, the need for user protections became clear (to some, but not all).",
  "By offering early internet users this much-desired—not to mention free—room of their own, GeoCities’ user base grew rapidly.",
  "“It allowed the FTC, by treating us as the poster child, to gain a foothold and establish its precedent, which stands today.",
  "For the more internet savvy Web 2.0 user, Facebook having an uncomfortable amount of data was an implicit part of the deal.",
  "“The common theme is whether a consumer really has a fair understanding of how their data is going to be used,” said Lazar.",
  "It was when that information fell into the wrong hands that we realized how potently concentrated our Facebook data was.",
  "On Wednesday, when New Mexico Rep. Ben Luján asked Mark Zuckerberg about data points, his answer was unsatisfactory.",
  "Much like Facebook today, the internet of 1998 was something lawmakers could scarcely wrap their heads around.",
  "“In this Facebook situation, you’re not merely talking about an email marketing campaign,” Lazar said.",
  "Yet both sites were highly accessible to users—temptingly free, with low technical barriers to entry.",
  "The 1998 FTC complaint against GeoCities came at a moment when the internet was in its awkward phase.",
  "GeoCities was one of the earliest instances of a virtual community—or communities, to be exact.",
  "GeoCities’ 2 million plus users may have “put it at the third largest website at the time.",
  "Luján: On average, how many data points does Facebook have on each Facebook user?",
  "GeoCities made and allegedly broke a promise not to give away its members’ data.",
  "The consent order mandated that the company not misrepresent its data practices.",
  "Was it going to—and more importantly, was it allowed to—commercialize that data?",
  "Was it violating people’s privacy or misrepresenting their purposes?",
  "Of course, there are some key differences, not least size and scale.",
  "Not to mention its role in helping GIFs become what they are today.",
  "“It established the FTC as the sheriff on privacy,” Lazar said.",
  "In Facebook’s case, it was the users who clicked it away.",
  "Zuckerberg: I do not know off the top of my head.",
  "Facebook, meanwhile, knows … everything about us?",
  "Won’t somebody please think of the children??",
  "By 1997, it had surpassed 1 million members.",
  "So what are we now going to do about it?",
  "GeoCities misrepresented its purposes.",
  "(Cool!)"
