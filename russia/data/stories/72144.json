  "Putin said he doesn’t have a favorite because “we do not know how any candidate would act.” However, he added that “we can’t but welcome the words, the ideas, the intentions mentioned in public referring to the normalization of relations between the United States and Russia.” While he didn’t specify, this presumably refers to Trump’s statements that “If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.”\n\nPutin also weighed in with some thoughts on Trump’s public image and campaign strategy:\n\nAs for Mr. Trump, he seems to have chosen his own method, his own way to appeal to the electorate.",
  "Putin’s response as to whether Russia is actively trying to interfere in the election, as the U.S. has alleged, admittedly deserves some credit for cleverness and gall: “Does anyone seriously think that Russia can somehow influence the choice of the American people?",
  "Putin denied it, sort of, saying that the idea was a false notion promoted by “those who represent the interests of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton against Mr. Trump, the representative of the Republican Party”:\n\nHow is this being done?",

  "Whether this is effective for him or not, we will see from the election results, but let me repeat once again that we will work with any president who is elected and who will want to work with us.",
  "He represents the interests of common people and is playing like a simple guy who criticizes those who have been in power for decades, who don’t like that power can be inherited.",
  "He also took a question from the audience about the view of the “foreign mass media” that the Kremlin is favoring Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election.",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting to discuss the Ukrainian peace process at the German federal chancellery on Oct. 19 in Berlin.",
  "This is just a way of political struggle, a way to manipulate public opinion on the eve of the election.",
  "Then it is declared that Trump is the Russian favorite.",
  "This is being said directly by U.S. experts.",
  "First the image of an enemy is created.",
  "Is America a banana republic or what?",
  "America is a great power.”",
  "That enemy is Russia.",
  "This is nonsense.",
  "What way is this?"
