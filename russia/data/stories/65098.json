  "On Tuesday, both the U.S. and the European Union ratcheted up sanctions on Russia, causing British oil company BP to question its involvement with Rosneft, saying \"Further economic sanctions could adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia, the level of our income, production and reserves, our investment in Rosneft and our reputation.\"",
  "\"I think it's possible, in the worst case scenario, that Exxon's participation in some things could be halted, if there's nowhere for them to go, but I think that they'll be straight back as soon as the situation changes,\" Nekipelov told TV Rain, saying he was speaking \"as an expert and a scientist rather than as the chairman of the board of directors.\"",
  "Rosneft does business with major American companies including Exxon and Morgan Stanley, which planned to sell its oil trading unit to Rosneft; Exxon signed a deal in 2011 worth billions of dollars with the company, and the two have planned to partner on an Arctic oil field exploration initiative.",

  "\"There's one thing introducing sanctions won't have any effect on at all,\" Nekipelov added.",
  "\"We don't have any comment on media reports,\" Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told BuzzFeed.",
  "Now, it looks like Exxon could be making the same calculation, according to Nekipelov.",
  "I would think too soon to tell,\" the source said in an email.",
  "\"It won't change the oil resources in the Arctic.\"",
