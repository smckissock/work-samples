  "But what I will say is that Director Comey, who I -- again, I like and I respect, but I also know that a lot of what happened during the Hillary Clinton investigation, including his announcement of no charges against Hillary Clinton, putting aside the substance, Jake, that is unprecedented, for an FBI person, whether it's the director or special agent in charge of a local office, to make that type of announcement.",
  "TAPPER: I guess one of the things going on is -- and you know this as a former U.S. attorney who worked with both James Comey and Robert Mueller -- and I have only heard you say nice things about both men publicly and privately -- is that there is this effort by President Trump and his team and his allies in the media to do everything they can to destroy the Comey and Mueller -- their public reputations.",
  "It's going to turn around if we can pass the health care bill come the first of next year and all of these other issues about Donald Trump and his tweeting and Donald Trump and his -- and his -- his, you know, character are going to fall by the wayside once the issue -- once the issue shows that --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSYKES: I'm old enough to remember when Rick Santorum cared about character.",
  "You know, generally speaking, in a white-collar matter, where there's not concern about the spoilation of evidence and risk of flight, and there have been conversations, as there might have been in this case, with the potential target in advance, sometimes, an arrangement is worked out to avoid, you know, the circus of the FBI showing up and cameras showing up from CNN and other outlets.",
  "But I don't think they're going to stop the narrative, nor is Congress doing to stop the narrative that there are other things for Bob Mueller to be looking at with respect to the Clintons and the DNC and all the things that were going on there that seem to be much more evidence of cooperation with Russia than what we've seen so far from the Trump administration.",
  "[09:50:00]\n\n\n\nAnd this has got to be something that's concerning for people who support President Trump, because whether or not it proves collusion, whether or not it proves -- and President Trump might have no knowledge of anything that's going on it's still something of a black eye for those saying that there was nothing there.",
  "I mean, there's all this -- there's been a lot of smoke but really no fire with respect to that, and I suspect that, although I have no idea who's going to be indicted I suspect it's probably going to be someone down the food chain that they're trying to then leverage to get more information to try to indict farther up.",
  "[09:05:07]\n\n\n\nAnd, sometimes, what it takes to have someone focus on their own future and the possibility of having -- of getting lenience for themselves is to actually see that the prosecutors are not bluffing, but are prepared to go to court and seek a charge, which is what it seems like happened in this case.",
  "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that our position hasn't changed since day one and I think we are seeing now that if there was any collusion with Russia, it was between the DNC and the Clintons and certainly not our campaign.",
  "I mean, the supporters should look at what Ty Cobb is saying rather than going off on all of this crazy stuff about, you know, Hillary Clinton and e- mails again and we're going to start now another investigation into her e-mails when you've got 70 percent of people in Puerto Rico without power.",

  "CHRISTIE: Well, the good news is, I have been talking regularly to Governor Rossello of Puerto Rico to relay some of those things to him and to Tom Bossert, the homeland security adviser at the White House, who is kind of quarterbacking this, from their perspective, to share those lessons.",
  "TAPPER: One of the things we learned this week about the investigation into possible collusion, which remains yet unproven, is that President Trump's campaign data firm, Cambridge Analytica, reached out to WikiLeaks during the election to try to get access to Hillary Clinton's e-mails.",
  "In any case where there might be criminal activity on the part of more than one person, prosecutors like those in my former office and those that work in Bob Mueller's office now try to see who they can bring charges against first, and see if they have information about someone else.",
  "TAPPER: Nina Turner, distraction though it may be, it's also one of the reasons this ideas that during in the middle of this deal, and we should point out it was a nine-agency panel that okayed the Uranium One deal, not just the state department, although that was one of them.",
  "The problem in Puerto Rico has been that that infrastructure was so\n\n\n\nbadly degraded prior to the storm, because of the island's problems financially and the bankruptcy that they have been going through, that when that storm came through, the destruction made it even worse.",
  "And as they have begun to cycle back, what I have heard from them is that the problem in getting supplies around the country -- around the territory, rather -- and making sure that people are getting help is that the roads are destroyed everywhere outside of San Juan.",

  "RICK SANTORUM, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No, I don't think it's possible at least at this point that he's going to fire him -- particularly now that you have a -- the charge coming forward, and obviously, the grand jury was able to provide an indictment.",
  "Because as you point out, as you've been pointing out all morning, I think that you saw Trump, the Trump White House and the Trump media really prepping the battlefield to discredit this investigation, and possibly even laying groundwork to fire Bob Mueller.",
  "And I think what's really being sort of lost, Jake, in the -- in all the noise about, was there collusion in Mueller and all of that, the Russians egregiously meddled in our democracy in 2016, and they're still doing it, and they're going to do it again.",
  "BHARARA: Well, it's -- what a coincidence, right, Jake, that, as Bob\n\n\n\nMueller is getting his job done, and as he's getting closer to doing something that's real and filing charges, that political allies of the president are calling for his resignation.",

  "You know, all the speculation about how long it was going to take for Mueller to file charges has now come to an end, because he's filed them, apparently, five months into his tenure as special counsel.",
  "As special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible 2016 Russian collusion and, of course, Russian meddling enters a new stage, President Trump is asserting that he is already in the clear.",

  "So, I would look for a couple of things, one, whether or not Donald Trump has some reaction and talks in a way that could be used against him in the future, because Bob Mueller would do that.",
  "TAPPER: Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller has warned former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort that they're working to charge him with possible tax crimes and possible financial crimes.",

  "And do you think Congress should investigate the deal or the FBI informant whose lawyer says he has information about Russian efforts to influence the Clintons to win support for the deal?",
  "TAPPER: President Trump still focused on Hillary Clinton and her e- mails, now making it clear to the state department that he wants any remaining Clinton e-mails released and quickly.",
  "And this has raised the prospect that Mr. Mueller might offer Mr. Manafort leniency in exchange for any incriminating evidence about anyone else, including potentially President Trump.",

  "We have a lot more to talk about, including one prominent Republican who says Democrats will go -- are going to try to impeach President Trump if they win the House majority in 2008.",
  "I think the important thing that I learned in reading the background is, the company changed hands, but the uranium that's mined in the United States cannot leave the United States.",
  "And only after, you know, Bob Mueller was starting to make some progress have people like Newt Gingrich started to say, well, maybe he should resign or -- or cast aspersions on him.",

  "So, after he fired Jim Comey, he went on television with Lester Holt and said some things that I think people find incriminating in connection with an obstruction investigation.",

  "I agree with Jennifer that all of the reaction of the president, you know, it would be a typical reaction if someone's guilty but I don't think Donald Trump is typical.",

  "Coming up: A growing list of Republicans are now calling for the man now leading the Russian investigation, special counsel Mueller, to resign, as we just discussed.",
  "And the second thing I would look at is to see if the president of the United States is sending some kind of message to the potential defendant or other witnesses.",
  "I don't think it implicates anything legally, but I do think it's something that we should all be concerned about in terms of the way campaigns are run right now.",
  "TAPPER: You tweeted this morning that people should watch not only\n\n\n\nwhat special counsel Mueller does, but also how President Trump responds in the coming week.",

  "This argument that Mueller should resign, we're hearing more and more from the president's allies on Capitol Hill, from their obedient vassals in the media.",
  "And the Republican in charge of the House committee says he has no interest in prolonging the investigation -- quote -- \"one second longer than necessary.\"",
  "As a former U.S. attorney, which Trump associates do you think might likely find themselves in the most legal jeopardy at this point in the investigation?",
  "And, hopefully, that's the direction we will go in, instead of trying to jam down some massive unfunded tax cut that will only add to our kids' deficits.",
  "The idea that one House committee is going to do an investigation is somehow not going to take care of the problem in Puerto Rico is sort of ridiculous.",
  "I think it's important, Jake, to distinguish between what we're doing on the Senate Intelligence Committee and -- and Director Mueller's investigation.",
  "[09:20:03]\n\n\n\nI have heard we have sent more folks, Jake, down to Puerto Rico than any other state, over 1,100 National Guards people and state police.",

  "The first charges have been approved in Mueller's Russia investigation, the same day President Trump says it's agreed that there was no collusion.",

  "And, typically, you want to be pursuing people and pressuring people who have information of an incriminating nature above you in the food chain.",
  "We don't even know if it's charges against some of the people that you mentioned in the preview to this segment, Paul Manafort or Michael Flynn.",
  "And, you know, I don't know who funded it or how it was funded, but it wasn't a surprise to me, because that was what I understood had happened.",
  "GRANHOLM: Although -- although I will say -- I mean, he hasn't really tweeted this weekend about the Mueller investigation which is interesting.",
  "What I don't understand is how conservative Republicans feel the need to rationalize and enable the possible hacking of our election by Russia.",
  "I can tell you that our staff and our members have interviewed something like a hundred witnesses, hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.",
  "And the point -- I think the larger point is, other agencies, led by the Treasury Department, it's important that our viewers understand this.",
  "Seventy percent of the people of Puerto Rico, after the hurricane they suffered, the hurricanes they suffered, are still living without power.",
  "The White House has not commented on the development, and the president has been silent on the general going since news of the charges broke.",

  "CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think, at that point, those -- those materials were ready to be made public, were going to be put on the Internet.",

  "That's a different job than what we had in Sandy, because our infrastructure was in much better shape, but it is significant and serious.",

  "Richard Burr, the leading member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he expects his investigation to finish by early next year.",
  "And if the reports are true, the only thing we know is that there have been charges approved by a grand jury, and those remain sealed.",

  "As a former U.S. attorney general, do you think President Trump's associates should be worried about what might be allowed to unfold?",

  "Now, listen, I don't think I have seen things from the White House that is trying to impugn Director Mueller in these recent weeks.",
  "But you can also say, this has -- this is a complete distraction from this real story of the Russian interference in the election.",

  "Now we're going to have to start rebuilding those roads and that infrastructure for them, so that people can return to normalcy.",
  "It's also possible that they're charging a number of people at once, and they want to see, who's the first one through the door?",

  "And the fact is that, if something comes up this week, as CNN's reported, then we will move from there on the legal process.",

  "First off, when you're in law enforcement, and you're investigating folks, you are going to have bad things said about you.",

  "Instead, he's doing everything possible to distract, to divert, and now this undercurrent to get rid of the prosecutor.",
  "Can you shed some light about how this process works of offering leniency and how that might work in a case like this?",
  "And somebody might be permitted to show up at the courthouse at an appointed hour to surrender in a sort of civil way.",
  "And his attorney, Ty Cobb, was -- did an interview on \"The New York Times'\" podcast and he was actually really good.",
  "You know, Donald Trump is still, obviously, obsessed with playing the Clinton card, running against Hillary Clinton.",
  "We may end up -- it's entirely possible we will end up with the investigation at the end finding that there wasn't.",
  "And I wonder if, as a former prosecutor, as somebody who has said nice things about both men, if that bothers you?",
  "We are going to ask a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee looking into Russian meddling about that next.",
  "KING: Well, that's another question I'm not going to answer, because we're in the middle of the investigation.",
  "KING: Well, I think the House -- one of the House committees has already begun an Oversight Committee hearing.",
  "And then, after the primaries were over, in effect, the opposition research was turned over to the Democrats.",

  "TAPPER: The president says that we in the media have been painting an unfair picture of him as uncivil.",
  "[09:15:05]\n\n\n\nI think the good news from the president's perspective is, he's not under investigation.",
  "And I think that, you know, Director Mueller has to continue to review that with his own legal staff.",
  "But during that period, President Bill Clinton did go to Russia and give a speech for half a million.",
  "So, is that accurate, that there -- it's widely agreed, commonly agreed that there was no collusion?",
  "TAPPER: \"The Wall Street Journal\"'s editorial board is calling on special counsel Mueller to resign.",

  "They have discovered a way to turn the strengths of our country and the West against ourselves.",
