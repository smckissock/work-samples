  "We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”\n\nThat’s a rather mealy-mouthed summary of the Cambridge Analytica debacle, in which a ‘quiz app’ was only the tip of the spear wielded by political operatives set on influencing the U.S. election.",

  "And all the humble apologies in the world seem unlikely to save Zuckerberg’s political ambitions.",
