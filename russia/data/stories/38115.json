  "In 2013, investors bid up Apollo’s shares by about 80% as CEO Black publicly exclaimed the firm was selling “everything that’s not nailed down in our portfolio.” That year the firm generated a record $4 in cash distributions per share, mostly by selling winning crisis-era investments like LyondellBasell , causing investors to bid up the stock in anticipation of cash flowing back into their pockets.",

  "Trump's talk of killing the private equity industry's carried interest tax deduction has generated major headlines, but if it comes with broader tax reform it could create the biggest opportunity for the industry since firms like Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR listed their shares on public stock markets.",

  "“If the tax laws were reformed in a manner consistent with Trump's campaign rhetoric the PE sponsors would likely convert to C-corps and it would dramatically increase the number of potential shareholders,” says Chris Kotowski, a financials analyst with Oppenheimer.",
  "“I anticipate with a pretty high level of confidence that this stuff is going to happen,” he said of tax reform, before stating it is “as big a change happening all at once” as he’s seen in his 45-year career on Wall Street.",
  "\"Private equity stocks are one of the cheapest parts of the entire market,” says Bill Miller IV, portfolio manager of the $100 million LMM Income Opportunity Fund and an investor in Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and Fortress.",
  "Lowering corporate and individual tax rates could give private equity firms reason to convert from tax-avoiding pass through partnerships into ordinary corporations, opening up their shares to a far broader investor base.",
  "Apollo, the LMM Income fund’s top private equity holding, currently trades at about half the market multiple of traditional asset managers like T. Rowe Price, Legg Mason and Franklin Resources .",
  "It’s buyout investments dramatically outperform stock markets with a mix of leverage and savvy deal making, the firm earns radically higher fees, and its money is locked up for around 10-years.",
  "Black suggested a corporate tax rate cut to 20% and a trimming of the individual rate to 33% could make it attractive for Apollo to convert into an ordinary corporation, or C-corp format.",
  "\"But if rates come down a bunch in that doubling of taxation it may not be the worst thing in the world given that in a corporate form we're a much less complicated entity,\" he said.",
  "Furthermore, it keeps firms like Apollo and Blackstone off of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, and outside of sector groupings.",
  "“We've avoided in the past the double taxation and that's what drove us to the [pass-through-partnership],\" Apollo CEO Leon Black said at a Goldman Sachs conference last week.",
  "Even if he and his partners lost their personal carried interest deductions, the trade-off of moving Apollo to the market mainstream could be too good to pass up.",
  "“If you look at the architecture of the financial world it is going to change very substantially,” Schwarzman said of the Trump agenda at the Goldman conference.",
  "There is a credible case Blackstone and its top performing peers are the future of Wall street as banks, hedge funds and mutual fund firms continue to falter.",
  "For Schwarzman, Black and Kravis, already among the richest people on Wall Street, those kinds of gains could catapult them to a new stratosphere.",
  "The move could help remedy a dramatic market discount on the public shares that make up the bulk of the wealth of private equity billionaires.",
  "But the tax shield also relegates these firms to stock market backwaters because it saddles investors with complex K-1 tax forms.",
  "Kotowski says the most frequent objection he hears from investors about private equity stocks is their partnership structure.",
  "Such a move could unwind a chronic discount attached to private equity stocks despite their master of the universe pedigree.",
  "The carried interest deduction allows private equity to use this structure to avoid double taxation on winning investments.",
  "Despite this growth, which creates a steady stream of fees, Apollo's stock has barely budged over the past three years.",
  "Since the end of 2013, Apollo shares have fallen by 50% even as its assets continue to grow at a staggering clip.",
  "As banks stumbled, Blackstone and many of its peers came out of the crisis in better shape than they went in.",

  "If Trump achieves tax reform, could it allow Schwarzman to remove his market discount?",
  "Then when the selling was done, they abandoned the stock due to its lumpy earnings.",
  "I think we'd have a much broader investor base which would be good for the stock.",
  "As an ordinary public corporation, “you don't have the whole K-1 situation.",
  "Donald Trump has vowed to kill one of Wall Street’s favorite tax loopholes.",
  "The same holds true for competitors like Blackstone, KKR and Carlyle.",
  "I think we could get into a financial index group,” Black added.",
  "Apollo declined to comment, as did Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR.",
  "Yet Blackstone’s stock trades below its 2007 IPO price.",
  "What might that trade-off look like for the industry?",
  "True, but perhaps the problems run even deeper.",
  "Yet Apollo has a better business.",
  "Again, Apollo is illustrative.",
  "This gripe seems legitimate.",
  "Apollo isn’t isolated."
